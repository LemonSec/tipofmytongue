1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,240
everybody speaks about it they speak a

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,440
lot about it and very

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,160
they speak about it for so long

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,680
when the words art and word intellect uh

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,439
were brought together and we get this uh

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:20,800
combination of words artificial

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,960
intelligence so what is artificial

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,359
intelligence today we'll speak with the

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,119
streets of specialists from the

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,960
department of perspective technologies

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,800
in the perspective of ultra females

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,840
teacher data gym practitioner with

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,559
experience okay hello

14
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,320
let's give a definition

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,800
what do you mean by artificial

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,399
intelligence because i'm confident that

17
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,239
there could be a lot of opinions eager

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,320
is a wide concept which includes a lot

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,320
of different things

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,320
machine learning it's a part of a.i

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,320
algorithm of full technology it's full

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,438
of algorithms and technologies which

23
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,799
allows to automate

24
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,280
different

25
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,040
not as objectives standard code when you

26
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,640
program when you write a code and you

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,400
know that something can be expected from

28
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,479
this program but when the algorithm is

29
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,400
self learning on the basis of the data

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,840
that you provide to it

31
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,960
and of course there are different

32
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,000
algorithms there are different models of

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,280
ai

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,520
and as you know there are models which

35
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,439
can play

36
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,960
games there are models which you

37
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,520
discover pictures there are models

38
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,439
which imitate text and there's a lot a

39
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,040
lot of different models and basically

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,119
speaking that's a wide concept

41
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,640
what do you mean by that well i

42
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,079
understand this is a very complicated

43
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,600
term it has a lot of sites you can

44
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,680
approach it from different slides

45
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,360
what's close to me it's understanding

46
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,200
that artificial intelligence is a system

47
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,920
of decision making which can operate uh

48
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,600
on the level comparable to human

49
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,119
thinking it's an algorithm it's a

50
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,280
strange entity but it's a thing which

51
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,280
can make decisions and you say i will do

52
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,360
it this way not other way and we'll

53
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,280
explain why it was done

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,440
machine learning is within this paradigm

55
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,360
all systems

56
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,440
also within this paradigm and the

57
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,360
borders like oh this is just algorithm

58
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,959
this is ai

59
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,040
on the level of solutions

60
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,280
and responsibility which the system can

61
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,599
undertake okay let's speak about

62
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,840
connection between ml machine learning

63
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,840
and ai artificial intelligence these

64
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,160
terms are sounding together

65
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,840
but it's not really understandable how

66
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,680
they are combined together but in common

67
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,319
between them and what is the difference

68
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,640
ml is uh artificial intelligence

69
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,920
multiplicity of uh intelligence

70
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,160
there is artificial intelligence and uh

71
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,680
there is machine learning as a part of

72
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,560
it

73
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,879
as night shift yesterday so there's also

74
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,680
some other things which are the part of

75
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,200
the artificial intelligence some other

76
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,720
components

77
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,000
yes

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,560
yes

79
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,599
you know this concept which means a lot

80
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,760
of variety of interpretations abundance

81
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,040
interpretation and this is one of the

82
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,640
approaches one of the process of solving

83
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,800
this relationship is one of the way of

84
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,879
solving the plurality of artificial

85
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,040
intelligence there are some other ways

86
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,519
which we don't know about yet but one

87
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,120
does not equal another one can be the

88
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,040
part of it for example ml is a part of

89
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,360
the ai but not the other

90
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,280
so where we know that in ai there's a

91
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,400
lot of components but from these

92
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,040
components we know only of ml

93
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,799
that's it

94
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,200
also we can speak about deep learning

95
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,879
this is the part of the machine learning

96
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,400
let's speak about the machine learning

97
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,400
deep learning and all other connections

98
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,840
in this array because we hear a lot of

99
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,680
terms but maybe under some examples you

100
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,120
will give us an explanation what is what

101
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,120
is

102
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,640
artificial intelligence and like well

103
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,000
there wouldn't be an argument but you

104
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,560
know we have some dialogues and we don't

105
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,680
know what's going to be the reason well

106
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,280
machine learning it's a very

107
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,480
understandable concept

108
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,120
relatively we had a concept called deep

109
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,920
learning neural networks uh it's a deep

110
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,519
learning it's a neural networks and

111
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,399
something like that it's a new cool hype

112
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,638
thing

113
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,040
can do a lot of different tasks

114
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,400
for example machine learning

115
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,960
some methods of machine learning have

116
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,960
been applied dozens of years ago like

117
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,680
linear regression and it was not called

118
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,600
like this it was called data analysis

119
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,520
and was successfully applied

120
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,720
but deep learning

121
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,560
has an association of something cool

122
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,440
some pictures generation uh driverless

123
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,080
cars a deep fake deep learning whatever

124
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,479
something cool heavy complicated complex

125
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,000
from one of your mathematics but

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,560
beautiful

127
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,800
yeah it is cool it is cool

128
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,000
and the results they are worthy of it

129
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,600
and right now we have a lot of

130
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,000
interesting models for example if we're

131
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,240
going to speak a recent

132
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,360
year

133
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,720
bob and i have presented a couple of

134
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,400
months ago a new version of dali model

135
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,360
and this is a symbiosis of names of

136
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,479
salvador dali and the robot valley dali

137
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,759
so this is a model which knows

138
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,680
to look at the textual description and

139
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,199
generate an image

140
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,560
not a

141
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,280
type of image like

142
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,800
stick stick

143
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,479
circle man no this is an artwork this is

144
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,160
sometimes looks like photographic and

145
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,600
you will not see the difference between

146
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,240
photograph photography and this image

147
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,000
then you can ask this neural network to

148
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,919
generate anything you can say okay

149
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,360
give me the panda which drives the

150
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,120
bicycle and the red square and you will

151
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,919
get this panda but how will it happen

152
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,960
magic magic magic

153
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,520
okay let's dig deeper well this is the

154
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,880
model which has been learning on

155
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,120
it has been learning and driving pandas

156
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,720
and bicycles on the red square they've

157
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,960
been learning to make pictures from the

158
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,759
text and generate text from pictures

159
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,360
it's been collecting here's a picture

160
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,960
here's the text and right now wait wait

161
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,440
wait i will try to develop this logic in

162
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,000
every text that's how i think in the

163
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,400
text there are several keywords panda

164
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,479
bicycle red square

165
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,000
adjectives

166
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,639
it looks at these uh adjectives and

167
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,440
unites them together that's how it works

168
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,639
or i'm far away from the truth

169
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,800
where the

170
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,720
sequence is very important the way of

171
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,199
aggregation is very important

172
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,680
and pieces of words because panda and

173
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,160
pandas you know nouns together it's

174
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,080
almost but not and not two different

175
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,479
nouns but still and because of all of

176
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,960
these uh we built some perception

177
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,120
cognitive perception once again and then

178
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,960
we look can we generate a picture on the

179
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,800
basis of those nouns

180
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,560
and the magic is that big models are

181
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,680
able to adequately represent text

182
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,080
as a point in the space and this point

183
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,840
can become a picture beautiful

184
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,880
picture so in the perspective of

185
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,759
technology will develop

186
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,720
in can take tolstovsky

187
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,880
war and peace and make a full-scale

188
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,719
movie instead of a film director

189
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,720
select the general you will select and

190
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,800
it's going to be a movie uh developed

191
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,479
just for you

192
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,240
do you like it

193
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,319
this is very cool

194
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,000
but it simplifies your life it will

195
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,840
simplify the life and this is wonderful

196
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,840
what simplifies life

197
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,599
let's speak about the future you know

198
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,319
what such as

199
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,479
so right now

200
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,919
right now

201
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,560
it can be called it's on the stage of

202
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,680
birth

203
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,560
or it's already in which stage it is

204
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,000
well it's not a question to me we can

205
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,680
discuss i think this is

206
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,879
infancy

207
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,000
early infancy so the baby has been born

208
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,840
it

209
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,758
grows and makes his first steps

210
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,599
i think

211
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,960
we still are solving small tasks

212
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,280
and we call artificial intelligence

213
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,319
things which are not achievable

214
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,240
intelligence so it was not born yet i'm

215
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,800
not artificially intelligence i'm this

216
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,240
nails brain compared to the brain of the

217
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,360
monkey

218
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,679
yeah something like that

219
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,599
yes i will agree with the fact that if

220
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,120
we are speaking about the term of

221
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,599
artificial intelligence as we have used

222
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,519
it to like terminator and other things

223
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,959
yes we are too far away but i think that

224
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,160
a fact

225
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,399
that some neural network can determine

226
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,760
the meaning of the text that can

227
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,240
determine the context can determine

228
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,440
very complicated things

229
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,120
i think

230
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,240
this is a big step forward that we've

231
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,160
done but then

232
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,680
path is still big ahead of us

233
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,600
speaking about deep fake as a popular

234
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,560
term

235
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,480
how is it related to deep learning

236
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,399
machine learning and ai

237
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,399
well i'll give you the answer

238
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,519
it's called deep because it was

239
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,519
created by machine algorithms which

240
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,279
called deep learning

241
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,680
it has its own minus

242
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,360
and terminology is very interesting and

243
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,880
curious because at a certain moment time

244
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,800
you stop calling models being models the

245
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,240
algorithms

246
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,160
how it works and words are changing

247
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,240
what's uh reflect understanding of the

248
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,600
situation

249
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,760
coming back to the question of why deep

250
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,160
fake because it was a generated image

251
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,040
and deep because it generated by deep

252
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,880
learning algorithms

253
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,839
so algorithms based

254
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,120
on deep learning

255
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,040
neural networks

256
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,360
technology what they do in order to have

257
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,959
this image well it's been trained in

258
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,600
such a way so they would give image

259
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,680
okay let's stop at the images with a

260
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,279
certain properties for example with the

261
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,959
face of a specific person

262
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,200
or in a certain visual style

263
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,240
or replacing a person by giving him

264
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,000
mustache

265
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
a full class of neural networks which

266
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,519
solves these subjects deep fake is one

267
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,720
of the applications of these neural

268
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,640
networks which can replace one phase by

269
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,399
another face

270
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,399
but in the current world

271
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,680
right now

272
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,880
where the ai has replaced humans

273
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,200
or has it yeah but yeah has it

274
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,040
i wouldn't say that it has completely

275
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,360
replaced people or humans but i would

276
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,839
say that there is a sphere where it has

277
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,920
simplified our work for example if we're

278
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,079
speaking where are we closest to

279
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,040
replacing a person is driverless car

280
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,640
and driverless

281
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,399
airplanes

282
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,120
in the rest of them

283
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,040
in cyber security

284
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,079
artificial intelligence uh very

285
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,360
we'll start

286
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,040
changing cognitive load from our

287
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,360
specialists

288
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,360
it will start removing a different uh

289
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,680
products uh from our path and we will be

290
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,240
able to release

291
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,760
release ourselves and we will do it in

292
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,240
such a way so that specialists wouldn't

293
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,160
have such cognitive law they will not

294
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,000
carry this load they will concentrate on

295
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,079
really important things on

296
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,240
things where they are needed and routine

297
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,680
work will be removed from them so the

298
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,160
automation will work yes definitely

299
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,279
and

300
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,000
in cyber security this is what we do

301
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,760
yes i will support my colleague there

302
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,200
are no areas where artificial

303
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,360
intelligence have replaced humans but in

304
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,959
many places have

305
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,680
reduced the cost of work and operations

306
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,040
and second example in addition to

307
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,279
security in addition to driverless cars

308
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,120
is call centers

309
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,880
many of them have been automated because

310
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,120
you can communicate with robert

311
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,040
and if they don't send you a question

312
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,079
it's like hello you're being called by

313
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,360
company

314
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,399
call which number i cannot hear you very

315
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,240
well yeah this is a simple example

316
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,480
you stupid ones wish me to a human being

317
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,920
i cannot hear you very well

318
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,120
yeah it's a very bright example but

319
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,360
there are some small examples and uh

320
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,720
only at the end of the conversation you

321
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,839
will understand that this was a

322
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,360
conversation with the robot and at the

323
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,440
end they tell you yeah and right now

324
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,760
there's a lot of robotized voices which

325
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,399
are in distance they sound naturally

326
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,519
hard to say the difference by

327
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,240
intonations they properly build

328
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,040
the meaning of sentenced

329
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,279
semantical development of sentences

330
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,639
speaking about the possibilities of

331
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,680
hackers and artificial intelligence

332
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,360
in such situations like driverless cars

333
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,160
is it possible that archer will break

334
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,279
driverless car and in result of these

335
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,240
some uh

336
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,240
an admissible event will happen for

337
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,240
humans or for the car

338
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,399
possible possible this fear is actually

339
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,279
being investigated and therefore from

340
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,279
the point of view of companies which are

341
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,560
involved in defense of course

342
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,839
higher interest is applied to these and

343
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,920
they are working on minimizing those

344
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,399
risks

345
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,399
would not

346
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,720
exaggerate those risks well it was a

347
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,720
really wide statement well they might

348
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,959
hack it or maybe they not hack it

349
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,880
because we have guys more than 100

350
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,480
people

351
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,800
and they are hacking this digital city

352
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,000
replica

353
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
can they hug the driverless car of

354
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,760
course they will of course they will

355
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,760
yeah they will definitely

356
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,000
which risks can be entailed from this

357
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,360
hiking

358
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,120
big risks of course

359
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,240
like in any accident it depends uh where

360
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,279
it's going to be used if we're speaking

361
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,079
about machine machine can stop or

362
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,600
the car can

363
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,240
make some wrong decision uh it can be

364
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,760
moved in the wrong direction but right

365
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,839
now we're just on the stage of

366
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,600
development of this technology and i

367
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,000
think that with time

368
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,120
it's going to be more and more more

369
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,839
difficult to do it and

370
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,560
artificial intelligence will protect

371
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,880
other models

372
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,880
so there will be artificial intelligence

373
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,639
which is going to protect another

374
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,279
intelligence

375
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,600
and this is what we do in cyber security

376
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,959
we have some standard means of

377
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,639
protection

378
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,519
and we are trying to transfer our

379
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,760
expertise

380
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,839
expertise of our specialists

381
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,519
we try to transfer it to artificial

382
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,720
intelligence

383
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,720
can you give me more

384
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,959
information about it

385
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,880
ai in informational security how it can

386
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,440
be used well

387
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,480
a lot of cases a lot of cases where it

388
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,079
can be used and there's a lot of cases

389
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,399
where we already applied and partially

390
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,199
we can advertise our industry

391
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,839
so that people who are involved in ai

392
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,519
so they wouldn't think that uh cyber

393
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,279
security plus artificial intelligence is

394
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,120
boring no it's not in cyber security

395
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,800
you can apply a lot of interesting

396
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,399
algorithms

397
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,320
very diverse algorithms for example out

398
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,920
of the recent one

399
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,320
what can be remembered yesterday with a

400
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,880
presentation by our colleague and he was

401
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,279
telling us about application of guns

402
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,839
generating

403
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,680
networks which have been invented for

404
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,160
generation of pictures so we applied

405
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,959
them

406
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,320
uh

407
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,759
to generate uh sql injections so we have

408
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,639
a model and this model starts thinking

409
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,800
as a hacker it starts looking for new

410
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,759
paths new vectors of attack uh new

411
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,240
levels of sql injections but it's not

412
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,560
applied from the point of view okay ai

413
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,839
goes and breaks something you know it's

414
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,800
applied uh to push experts for a certain

415
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,959
interesting idea

416
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,040
uh start them thinking about something

417
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,000
they haven't been thinking about

418
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,920
previously okay mikhail

419
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,560
in description of your position it says

420
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,079
that your practitioner when experience

421
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,800
so i wanna ask you in the area of ai

422
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,359
where your experience is applied

423
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,920
mostly

424
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,079
internet marketing in different areas

425
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,199
yes

426
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,079
analysis of uh user behavior sales

427
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,920
advertising everything which is related

428
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,519
with the internet fast feedback and

429
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,040
users this is the first point of

430
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,880
application of the ai

431
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,880
probably well and is it true

432
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,800
maybe not really related question but

433
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,040
maybe it is for example right now we're

434
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,279
speaking about a lot of keywords for

435
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,040
example i have mobile phone laying next

436
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,040
to me and then it starts showing me

437
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,839
information social networks is it really

438
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,880
listening to me

439
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,160
well the answer is the following we

440
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,000
don't know the whole truth

441
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,160
but theoretically it can do it but it

442
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,519
shouldn't

443
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,360
more aha

444
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,279
it can but it shouldn't

445
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,280
yeah so it listens definitely

446
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,359
most probably

447
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,480
speaking about the future development of

448
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,319
a.i in the nearest years

449
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,720
short term two three years from now

450
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,319
in which direction do you think it will

451
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,839
move and in which areas it will be

452
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,839
applied practically

453
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,919
i think well you've been mentioning a

454
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,919
lot of different cool models language

455
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,240
models

456
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,919
it's a transformer class modulus and i

457
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,039
think the background development will be

458
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,400
in this area we will develop

459
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
transformers

460
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,880
language classes and neural networks

461
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,679
and i immediately see this robot

462
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,679
well it's going to transform one

463
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,559
sequence into another sequence the text

464
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,520
into image sound into text etc it will

465
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,600
transform text from one language into

466
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,799
the text in another language

467
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,120
so i think this is going to be

468
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,440
developing and the multi-modal models

469
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,799
will be developed

470
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,679
when we work with several types of data

471
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,919
we work with text and sound we work with

472
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,080
video images etc

473
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,320
so

474
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,919
that's what i think i think we're going

475
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,360
to move in this direction but which

476
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,799
spheres it's going to involve it's going

477
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,200
to involve a lot of speeds it will come

478
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,280
to the industry it will come to i.t et

479
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,918
cetera et cetera

480
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,280
i have similar opinion i think these

481
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,320
models will be developed and they can

482
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,080
you can teach model only once and you

483
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,480
can use these uh

484
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,280
like a universal mini brain a small

485
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,559
neural core

486
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,160
to which you can give different tasks

487
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,880
and

488
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,720
we will have a lot of applications with

489
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,039
very unusual places

490
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,360
with a good quality and i expect very

491
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,120
soon not qualitative growth of

492
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,159
artificial intelligence but quantity

493
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,280
areas

494
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,200
and even right now you can see

495
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,160
approaches

496
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,960
where we can see good operation with

497
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,320
images and i really expect that the work

498
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,080
of designers as we know will be

499
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,559
transformed in the next five years just

500
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:13,919
because there will be neural networks

501
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,799
that will add requests like can you make

502
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,280
me the same but in the style of this

503
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,679
artist but can you add some other object

504
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,200
inside of this picture and not only to

505
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,640
designers but if we will try to invent

506
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,640
where one specific model

507
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,840
can be used will generate dozens of

508
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,679
different scenarios

509
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,400
and business plans where these can be

510
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,000
used that digital business can be built

511
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,720
around one model

512
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,280
about professions because it's well the

513
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,039
heavy part of work will be replaced by

514
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,600
more cognitive more interesting

515
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,600
the professions will not disappear they

516
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,360
will be transformed

517
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,559
but what's going to be the result of all

518
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,600
of these will ai replace humans and what

519
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,120
is the role of humans

520
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,159
will a person become you know

521
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,799
drive lower class person who will be

522
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,000
used just as a battery

523
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,320
it's a very negative scenario i prefer

524
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,240
positive thinner that person will be

525
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,559
involved in creative work uh cognitive

526
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,600
operations routine will disappear

527
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,880
and we will be somewhere in the middle

528
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,799
so i don't like those negative

529
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,918
pessimistics in the areas

530
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,280
yeah i'm not on the side of the semester

531
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,799
because there's a lot of technologies

532
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,320
where this can be used and there's a lot

533
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,280
of time to understand

534
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,120
today

535
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,840
many people didn't even guess this

536
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,919
interesting connection between

537
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,000
them

538
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
yeah

539
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,369
[Music]

540
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,399
and maybe some scenario type of thinking

541
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,520
and it is very interesting what eager

542
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,760
would tell us to be applied in cyber

543
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,760
security

544
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,840
um

545
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,919
and this is well developed in the world

546
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,520
from the point of view of development of

547
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,799
artificial intelligence and which place

548
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,640
right now is taken by russia and do our

549
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,440
russian engineers and developers have a

550
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,799
potential for making some qualitative

551
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,080
improvement in this area

552
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,760
i wouldn't select any separate country i

553
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,240
would say it's a symbiosis because most

554
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,919
of these technologies are openstack

555
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,360
technologies people are sharing this

556
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,520
technology something's working

557
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,320
they

558
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,600
shift this knowledge

559
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,600
yes

560
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,799
as for the russia and our position and

561
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,000
how strong we are

562
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,640
no i would say that yes we do have good

563
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,559
positions

564
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,039
and we

565
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,480
uh

566
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,840
so i think everything's okay

567
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,880
i also think that

568
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,520
the course is very international

569
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,240
precisely in one scientific school or in

570
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,440
what was going on

571
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,200
impossible to do that so there's a lot

572
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,480
of schools and there are several schools

573
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,280
in

574
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,280
uh

575
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,559
samsung love is very strong in russia

576
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,480
and from the point of view of some

577
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,679
applied things i think that we are not

578
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,120
behind but we are even ahead so do

579
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,640
russian guys have chances to do

580
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,760
something yes of course

581
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,600
such a certain areas artificial

582
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,760
intelligence well i hope that earlier or

583
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,860
later

584
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,320
[Music]

585
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,080
give to the world some improvements
