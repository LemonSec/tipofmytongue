practicality they're learning modern

47
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,600
languages they use github but at the

48
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,479
same time without any understanding and

49
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,320
deep understanding of the environment

50
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,759
open source understanding understanding

51
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,960
what is the community open source

52
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,960

real open source projects on be involved

59
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,840
in open license and getting feedback

60
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,760
from experts and of course uh relatively

61
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,599

looks at the results and in other

64
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,840
direction we are still going to work on

65
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,760
these results in course of may and in

66

them

69
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,280
how long did this competition take well

70
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,440
this year we have launched it within

71
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,680
this uh period after the new year we

72
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,360
have launched and right now we're

73
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,360
drawing the results uh with the purpose

74
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,360
so that uh

75
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,920
winners would get additional points uh

76
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,080
for entering the university but uh

77
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,920
generally speaking we assume that this

78
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,920
contest will be launched next every year

79
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,000
and we're connected to the year so that

80
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,400
students who do their diploma works

81
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,959
could include all of this and publish it

82
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,959
uh the open license et cetera well can

83
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,800
you remind me how many participants have

84
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,879
participated this year well this year we

85
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,879
have more than 2 000 people

86
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,959
mostly these were students mostly were

87
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,519
students of leading universities and i.t

88
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,680
specialties there are school kids and

89
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,599
this is very cool that

90
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,040
guys

91
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,920
being

92
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,239
in last grades in school they make

93
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,000
projects and put them in their portfolio

94
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,080
which is very important for future i.t

95
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,760
specialists

96
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,519
approximately

97
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,640
more than 500 projects were submitted by

98
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,000
our people

99
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,080
right now they are different and because

100
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,120
they are all on the github and they can

101
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,720
look at it well they can press the

102
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,480
buttons they can read the information

103
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,879
they can see the number of stars and at

104
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,040
the github by these projects and right

105
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,360
now we do the expertise when they will

106
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,720
get the feedback

107
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,640
from the representative company involved

108
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,040
in open source in russia

109
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,200
and what type projects

110
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,599
have been uh conducted by those guys

111
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,239
well different projects there are guys

112
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,560
who are not here for the first day

113
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,120
they write some libraries

114
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,640
they write some tools

115
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,920
artificial intelligence projects

116
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,080
some individual objectives information

117
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,640
security utilities

118
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,238
and by the way another popular thing is

119
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,320
games

120
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,798
because some people do some games for

121
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,720
the contest they publish them with open

122
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,240
source

123
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,800
it's interesting and of course generally

124
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,000
speaking it seems that uh for most of

125
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,639
the people this was the first attempt of

126
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,320
getting acquainted with open source and

127
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,400
for us that's a big advantage that we're

128
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,400
able to pull this up and why is it so

129
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,360
important because together with the

130
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,800
contest we have launched educational

131
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,720
program with a lot of different people

132
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,240
from this area

133
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,080
and they are telling what is this all

134
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,199
about they are speaking about these

135
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,560
aspects and we think that this

136
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,479
experience of participation in context

137
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,720
gives us good base so that would learn

138
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,479
more about it and what about educational

139
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,880
program what does it include

140
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,800
how it works well it's very important

141
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,360
for us to show and tell

142
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,280
from firsthand from the side of those

143
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,240
people who work with our companies and

144
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,160
whole projects themselves participate in

145
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,880
big programs in the communities

146
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,560
what is this

147
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,039
in real life

148
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,560
how can we deliver our contribution into

149
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,479
the existing projects what difficulties

150
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,840
are you going to see when you have to

151
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,039
communicate and find some entrance level

152
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,880
together with your team if you publish a

153
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,880
project if you activate the license what

154
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,240
is the license and why is it so

155
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,800
important how can you make your project

156
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,880
viable after you publish it how can you

157
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,400
attract people into the community and

158
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,680
there's a lot of questions which are

159
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,600
related not just to technical part as

160
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,759
programming but also well many people

161
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,600
can learn that but there's a lot of

162
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,560
content about it but how can you make it

163
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,160
operational how can you make it working

164
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,560
and the social uh surroundings around

165
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,759
this project and this is the main

166
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,280
emphasis that we're making because this

167
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,560
is something that is missing in the

168
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,120
market and do you have any stories when

169
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,240
developments made by young people have

170
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,560
been collected

171
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,840
and they started being used in some real

172
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,960
commercial or non-commercial projects

173
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,560
have they been developing something yes

174
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,360
of course you can see the top projects

175
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,639
are really

176
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,560
being used somewhere because they have a

177
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,960
lot of forks and stars and github from

178
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,960
this project said there's a lot of

179
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,280
diploid discussions and descriptions in

180
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,039
english well it's understandable that

181
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,720
these are students

182
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,240
people who already went to a certain

183
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,000
path and maybe our contest for them is a

184
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,080
little bit too simple and we should do

185
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,080
something else but generally speaking

186
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,720
we do have such examples from school

187
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,319
kids a lot of them

188
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,479
so we think that

189
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,240
in this topic there is a great potential

190
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,800
because there's a lot of projects which

191
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,039
are done by kids in schools and

192
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,759
universities and many of them are

193
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,000
ending up without any continuation

194
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,240
that's it but in this case

195
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,120
we can get a lot of feedback

196
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,240
if you need it for your personal

197
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,599
portfolio

198
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,160
and you can give this a story into

199
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,720
somebody else's hands to keep it alive

200
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,360
yes yes yes

201
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,919
very cool

202
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,440
means that you have to write and be and

203
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,880
publish something that you don't feel

204
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,319
ashamed for and it pushes you to a more

205
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,639
detailed approach to what you do and

206
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,880
plus you need to find some partners or

207
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,000
colleagues who are going to be

208
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,360
interested in this and this is an

209
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,440
important uh social component which

210
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,720
helps you

211
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,000
what do you think what's going to be the

212
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,199
destiny of your

213
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,280
project well first of all we are calling

214
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,199
our partners to offer some

215
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:53,199
internships and do something interesting

216
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,800
and right now in russia we have a

217
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,360
problem with well-known uh google google

218
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,840
sample code where you cannot be enrolled

219
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,440
russian mentors and students cannot and

220
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,599
be enrolled due to known reasons and

221
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,840
there's a number of teams and in russia

222
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,479
which are interested in open source

223
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,639
exercises

224
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,840
which continue

225
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,840
and they do such proposals for the guys

226
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,599
and i'm confident that many winners of a

227
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,520
contest will get such proposals because

228
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,199
realistically you can see

229
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,039
that people have experience and it would

230
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,120
be very cool to involve them in our

231
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,360
communities that's why the winners of

232
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,599
the contest well our open source teams

233
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,159
will fight for them you know to get them

234
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,240
to work for them well another one it's a

235
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,240
good attempt for the next year to make

236
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,839
it even better so there will be

237
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,120
continuation

238
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,000
yes we will make this contest every year

239
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,240
and we will do it in such a way so that

240
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,000
people

241
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,760
will be able to show their growth in

242
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,519
open source from year to year you will

243
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,480
see the projects

244
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,959
wonderful

245
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,880
when we've been preparing ourselves for

246
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,160
the interview when we've been speaking

247
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,600
about topics uh uh neighboring topics

248
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,839
can you tell me please what is open

249
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,320
source to you what do you invest what do

250
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,920
you put in the heads of young generation

251
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,640
of people well let's see for us open

252
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,959
source i will give you the quotes first

253
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,920
of all it's the

254
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,880
uh

255
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,120
code

256
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,480
according to

257
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,240
hamburg account this is something that

258
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,279
you've done because when we see

259
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,320
presentations of projects of students uh

260
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,640
high b startup presentations all they

261
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,880
want to do is a totally different before

262
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,240
you have done something and before you

263
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,160
show that it works nobody's interested

264
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,680
in you and i think this is something

265
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,000
that's missing on the side of modern

266
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,800
fashionable uh startup oriented young

267
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,880
teams because

268
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,360
you still have to do it you

269
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,120
don't just

270
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,320
speak about it it's a good shot which

271
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,920
everybody should go through every

272
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,320
specialist and the second thing

273
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,040
is the global community

274
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,720
irrespectively to all the difficulties

275
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,959
that we're facing right now globally i

276
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,720
confident that international cooperation

277
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,920
will be kept maybe transformed and will

278
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,600
have an experience of cooperation of

279
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,920
with people from india brazil united

280
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,600
states it doesn't matter which country

281
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,760
but still

282
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,360
it will be getting out of your own

283
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,360
capsule it's going to be a global

284
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,160
engineering world and i think this is

285
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,360
also an important thing which is

286
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,959
available in the science and it's

287
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,160
important for us to have it in

288
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,320
engineering as well because engineering

289
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,839
this is something which develops

290
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,200
continuously and we have to be on the

291
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,760
front lines we have to adopt the best

292
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,920
and we have to show that we are cool in

293
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,760
certain areas and something is to be

294
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,240
done with us

295
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,240
out of everything that you tell us i see

296
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,959
i hear that engineering

297
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,959
cannot

298
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,760
we all change our conditions at a

299
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,600
certain moment of time so what has

300
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,040
changed yes we've been speaking a lot

301
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,440
about what was changing in informational

302
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,440
security in i.t

303
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,519
what new rules of the game do we have

304
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,120
what do we expect

305
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,959
but what has changed about open source

306
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,560
well open source as any other spheres

307
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,760
very complicated things fees of human

308
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,640
relations

309
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,519
of course they been under serious impact

310
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,040
and in many communities especially in

311
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,480
communities with big number of

312
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,279
russian-speaking or maybe related to

313
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,800
russian people with some russian

314
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,240
background

315
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,240
they are suffering right now they feel

316
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,760
certain difficulties some of them are

317
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,680
breaking up in pieces but nevertheless

318
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,040
they are thinking and discussing

319
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,560
whatever happens

320
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,640
and it seems that for the whole open

321
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,040
source global open source it's a serious

322
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,959
challenge

323
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,519
will it happen that this movement will

324
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,160
keep its globality will it keep the

325
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,839
ideals that well put in a foundation of

326
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,720
uh for freedoms of nick raymond's

327
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,480
freedoms or some values that were

328
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,720
adopted by global engineering community

329
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,120
which is important to everybody i think

330
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,600
that most likely this is a stage of

331
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,079
growing when engineers cannot hide in

332
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,839
their engineering world but they have to

333
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,120
understand that the world is much more

334
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,600
complicated so i in the course of many

335
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,839
years more than 20 years i participated

336
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,880
in open source and i believe that

337
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,839
this is possible this can be overcame

338
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,079
just because there is a value of

339
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,920
unification the value for which people

340
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,120
get united the value uh for which the

341
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,959
common existence of people can become

342
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,800
better in the end run you know if

343
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,040
speaking roughly

344
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,680
highly moral

345
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,279
not many people like to speak about it

346
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,800
which will make it survive and this will

347
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,160
continue so what do you think

348
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,079
commercialization can this topic be

349
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,560
commercialized well this is a holy grail

350
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,279
to which everybody is trying to approach

351
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,839
and we will have to do that

352
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,720
because in russia we don't have so much

353
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,639
resources to develop something for the

354
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,639
sake of development we will have to look

355
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,200
at things pragmatically and open source

356
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,959
as a certain stage from which you begin

357
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,880
when you make your products i think this

358
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,399
is very important

359
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,800
and when we are going to speak about the

360
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
expert we have to speak about it we

361
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,360
shouldn't be closed in ourselves so open

362
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,639
source in the current situation in

363
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,480
russia is an important part of expert

364
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,639
because if you're going to show in india

365
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,240
brazil or any other country if you will

366
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,920
show your products and if you will show

367
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,959
it open parts which can easily be

368
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,680
replaced trusted substituted this will

369
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,120
always be an additional point to your

370
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,279
competitive advantage

371
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,639
and

372
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,920
this is something that should be

373
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,160
one part of your product one of the

374
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,440
parts of your product okay i understand

375
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,800
are there any trends ideas in open

376
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,839
source uh for the next five years

377
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,839
well we need to survive through this

378
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,399
crisis not only us but open source as a

379
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,079
community

380
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,600
and i believe that one of the most

381
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,399
interesting trends uh which is not new

382
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,480
but strong and stronger it's when open

383
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,519
source goes into others this open upper

384
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,040
uh some

385
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,399
open stories in the arts

386
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,399
and when the open source story becomes a

387
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,720
part of common cultural context like

388
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,040
wikipedia

389
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,760
so it becomes interesting concept yes

390
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,800
a general cultural norm when a person on

391
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,440
the street will know that wikipedia is

392
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,160
not just encyclopedia with where you can

393
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,000
find anything but it's encyclopedia

394
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,240
which is written together where you can

395
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,560
put your own input as well these things

396
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,320
are coming to the market we see how

397
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,480
crowdfunding and crowdsourcing in the

398
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,480
stocks have citizen science and many

399
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,440
other events which have general rules

400
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,000
coming to the open source as they first

401
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,839
conducted i believe that it will

402
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,839
penetrate into different life spheres

403
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,480
inevitably and we'll be able to see new

404
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,519
things

405
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,240
like sharing of some interesting things

406
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,079
concept sharing and other things i

407
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,319
believe

408
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,399
well the fantastic option can you

409
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,120
describe well the most fantastic option

410
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,360
i think it consists of the fact that we

411
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,839
finally will come to the situation that

412
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,120
knowledge which humanity accumulates

413
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,720
will become commonly accessible the

414
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,800
signs which exist right now which have

415
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,880
been encapsulated into separate

416
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,560
magazines uh

417
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,920
will be disclosed and opened and we'll

418
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,120
see new epoch of revitalization where

419
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,720
people start exchanging knowledge

420
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,240
respectively to

421
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,120
who has patented what

422
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,120
so the science and exchange of the

423
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,920
knowledge i don't understand the idea

424
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,639
because there are people of science who

425
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,639
understand what they are writing about

426
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,560
they understand what they're doing and

427
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,399
they don't

428
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,240
they're not coming from the outer space

429
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,959
they

430
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,959
it takes a lot of time to come to this

431
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,880
and tell something to the world but in

432
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,399
my concept the open source story

433
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,600
comes from the following

434
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
you informed me that according to all

435
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,320
the scientific rules the earth is round

436
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,279
uh

437
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,240
but i have the right to go to your works

438
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,360
and correct them and say no

439
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,279
the earth is flat and it has three

440
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,800
elephants under it

441
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,000
yeah i understand that i'm over

442
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,040
simplifying it

443
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,560
but reproducibility and openness is very

444
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,120
important here there is another aspect

445
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,399
which is closer to open source

446
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,920
engineering in the wider sense of this

447
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,880
word uh some translation into masses so

448
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,320
there's a certain knowledge of elites

449
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,160
and there are scientists who've

450
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,680
disclosed it and there's a popular

451
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,000
knowledge that we see in wikipedia and

452
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,360
there's a certain gap between them there

453
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,800
could be another concept from the

454
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,440
security point of view um

455
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,240
ct trust which is uh

456
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,639
like open source cryptography or roughly

457
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,119
speaking you trust your guy this guy

458
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,240
trust another guy and we build transit

459
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,919
trust networks and we'll get it in

460
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,959
knowledge system when we

461
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,559
i trust this professor because he was

462
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,119
teaching me and to me my friend also

463
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,119
trusts this professor and to this

464
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,400
network of trust and these are not

465
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,559
available in a popular space

466
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,240
but it's an important direction where

467
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,039
open source is going to help people this

468
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,039
is a new journalistics this is a new

469
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,080
science uh but based on other principles

470
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,000
so more horizontal because open source

471
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,480
is about horizontal relations

472
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,960
okay thank you very much alexi

473
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,160
so i think that in the last three days

474
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,240
we've discussed open source from

475
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,000
different positions

476
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,799
so i do hope that your contest next year

477
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,360
will have more participants

478
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,360
at least well i don't see how much more

479
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,320
can be added to it so i wish you success

480
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,200
uh to you and your

481
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,559
students

482
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,559
and success in everything you do and

483
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,640
don't switch off uh right now we're

484
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,559
going to see the continuation and maybe

485
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,559
we are going to speak about contests but

486
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,240
we are not going to speak about open

487
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,720
source don't switch off
