1
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,640
to somehow

2
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,760
rank him right

3
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,480
it's an important subject and i can only

4
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,760
mention it

5
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,000
last time

6
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,000
so let me remind you

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,640
the in the environment we're trying to

8
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,439
develop our score immortal so we've got

9
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,680
our iocs we have collected

10
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,759
so some are host level oh these are

11
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,200
network level like

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,600
host level indicators are hashes file

13
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,080
names mutexes and registry keys and

14
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,240
network ones include ip addresses

15
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,360
domains urls emails and user agents

16
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,920
for them we will build our scoring model

17
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,560
all right i should also mention here

18
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,759
what open sources are

19
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,079
in fact there are numerous open sources

20
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,479
and they differ in terms of quality well

21
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,360
in our database we have over 260.

22
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,880
they have some peculiarities

23
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,200
is that they may be

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,640
lacking content

25
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,880
i'm sorry context

26
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,040
but some you know just contain a flat

27
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,000
file

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,240
with an indicator inside it

29
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,560
sometimes you don't really know why it's

30
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,239
there in the first place and what it

31
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,800
represents

32
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,680
you know somebody is getting bored so

33
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,040
maybe you know from this ib address some

34
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,080
you know cnc is acting or maybe you know

35
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,920
they're brute forcing passwords over

36
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,599
there

37
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,840
moreover sometimes we don't really know

38
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,520
which particular say malware this ioc is

39
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,000
related to

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,080
so in conditions like this

41
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,080
we need to come up with a model that

42
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,640
will enable us to assess the threat

43
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,239
associated with each indicator like this

44
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,080
why would we want to do that why do we

45
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,400
need scoring

46
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,200
now if we look at a score associated

47
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,319
with it we should be able to quickly

48
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,440
assess

49
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,840
the threat associated with this ioc so

50
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,159
if a particular cyber security incident

51
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,200
happens

52
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,280
where this ioc

53
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,120
is seen you know we can provide

54
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,360
additional information to

55
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,640
stock people

56
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,480
or investigators

57
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,800
so that you know they actually factor it

58
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,800
in

59
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,879
is that it will enable you to reduce the

60
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,519
workloads on your high load

61
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,080
defenses

62
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,080
you can find like dozens of millions of

63
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,360
iocs online now imagine

64
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,680
you submit them all to a high load

65
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,360
system

66
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,920
which will analyze your events which

67
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,080
will analyze the network flow

68
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,680
and it will also

69
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,640
go checking every event and every

70
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,920
package every packet i'm sorry

71
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,920
for something interesting

72
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,839
this is actually a taxing operation

73
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,400
of all the iocs we have collected let's

74
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,799
just focus on the most dangerous ones

75
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,680
according to our scoring system

76
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,839
which means that you know this will have

77
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,000
priority in terms of processing and you

78
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,240
know the others will be processed later

79
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,040
on in the background

80
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,800
but

81
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,960
now if we're trying to choose a scoring

82
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,919
model

83
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,080
approaches may differ and again there

84
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,919
will be differences between vendors

85
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,560
and how they structure these query

86
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,960
models

87
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,560
so i'm showing a continuum here on the

88
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,720
left we have experts opinion on the

89
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,199
right machine learning and naturally

90
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,720
both have got their pros and cons

91
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,160
so to speak

92
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,320
out you know we've got experts they know

93
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,400
a lot about malware we've done our

94
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,560
incident investigation we've reverse

95
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,360
engineered this piece of malware

96
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,680
we know people i'm sorry we have people

97
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,000
with the know-how so our expert will

98
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,919
actually assign a number to this ioc

99
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,680
uh this is manual work obviously

100
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,560
parameters and it returns as values like

101
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,320
42.

102
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,280
well this system has got its drawbacks

103
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,960
as well because sometimes you need to

104
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,638
explain why it is 42.

105
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,580
and it may

106
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,719
[Music]

107
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,319
well actually you can in between

108
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,759
this is what we decided to do in my firm

109
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,560
in rsd clouds

110
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,039
we are developing a formula

111
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,360
that will give us a score based on the

112
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,160
parameters we collect and it is the kind

113
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,400
of system i'm going to describe in my

114
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,400
presentations

115
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,160
so for this scoring to happen we need to

116
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,759
go through several stages stage one

117
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,639
where we set the parameters

118
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,479
that will impact

119
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,240
the threat level of a particular

120
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,240
indicator

121
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,600
and we need to know well we will be

122
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,160
looking for these parameters because uh

123
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,440
like i said

124
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,680
some of these iocs are found in flat

125
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,400
files with no context

126
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,919
they obviously need to be

127
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,160
quantified i mean these parameters need

128
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,520
to be

129
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,080
translated into a metric

130
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,880
into a number that will be used by the

131
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,400
formula

132
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,919
and finally

133
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,840
stage three is where we actually

134
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,000
calculate the square on the basis of our

135
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,400
formula

136
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,680
it's also very important here to make

137
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,599
sure the score

138
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,720
is easy to understand

139
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,240
why am i emphasizing this

140
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,800
now imagine that it's a

141
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,039
traffic lights in this country wouldn't

142
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,000
have

143
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,080
numbers i wouldn't have lights but would

144
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,039
have numbers and you see 42. what would

145
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,880
that mean

146
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,800
same with scoring

147
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,639
we need to make sure

148
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,400
that people can read our scores and

149
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,960
know very clearly if they need to do

150
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,758
something about it

151
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,800
like is it already time for them to

152
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,520
de-power their servers or should they

153
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,240
you know stay calm

154
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,719
extract from it as

155
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,639
well first we can check the source from

156
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,360
which we downloaded this indicator

157
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,879
and

158
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,120
make a judgment call about the level of

159
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,160
trust we put in it

160
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,120
vendors or suppliers website they say

161
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,360
well we are an independent group of

162
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,279
researchers and we are monitoring and

163
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,679
see the darkness or whatever

164
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,120
and i understand okay they are probably

165
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,000
doing it manually

166
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,880
there is another way of getting those

167
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,880
indicators

168
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,560
or a sandbox which is a public so to

169
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,360
speak

170
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,440
where they register activities

171
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,000
from the white uh

172
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,120
wild

173
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,839
online world

174
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,839
and the third place

175
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,959
is that you know they have a system

176
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,160
which is browsing the nut

177
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,600
and you know they are actually

178
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,200
downloading everything they find

179
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,279
also we can check for context you know

180
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,000
sometimes the context will not be inside

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,120
the file itself maybe the file contains

182
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,040
nothing but ibs

183
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,080
but the website itself may tell us

184
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,720
that these are addresses of cnc's of a

185
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,720
particular malware

186
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,880
and this tells us okay we do have

187
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,399
contacts it's just that it sits in a

188
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,120
separate file and naturally combinations

189
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,640
of these options are also possible

190
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,440
now let's check how these parameters can

191
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,760
be translated into a metric

192
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,000
how can we actually digitize them so to

193
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,399
speak so we selected a pretty simple way

194
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,640
of doing it now we come up with a matrix

195
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,079
and we assign weights that describe the

196
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,560
amount of trust we put in a particular

197
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,440
source for example

198
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,720
if we know that we have downloaded

199
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,440
you know from a source which does you

200
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,240
know

201
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,600
high quality

202
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,839
research

203
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,240
or like we see a very clear link to say

204
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,040
an apt in a particular role

205
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,120
well it should be given the weight of

206
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,640
100.

207
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,480
can trust

208
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,800
you know with a weight of 40 where for

209
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,320
example our source confidence is low

210
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,839
and attribution

211
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,760
is non-existent

212
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,760
it's also important to understand as

213
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,880
we're dealing with sources

214
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,640
you know sources

215
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,519
may generate false positives i think all

216
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,760
sources will do that

217
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,640
that's why for every source

218
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,399
we will determine

219
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,760
a

220
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,519
corruption coefficient k

221
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,320
and as we are working with the source we

222
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,240
can actually manage the trust we are

223
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,160
putting in this particular source so for

224
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,480
example if we see

225
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,399
this particular source is generating

226
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,720
more false positives

227
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,839
we can actually keep the metrics intact

228
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,560
but temporarily rich is the trust we

229
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,160
have in this particular source

230
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,720
so our indicator could have come from

231
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,839
different sources simultaneously

232
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,760
we may want to choose you know some uh

233
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,240
cumulative or aggregate level of uh

234
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,279
trust

235
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,519
and we can you know just

236
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,320
use the max function for it

237
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,160
which means that you know it's a simple

238
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,519
part really of the solution

239
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,839
what other parameters can we find there

240
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,440
type of malicious activity

241
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,800
something that we called a role in the

242
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,320
previous slides

243
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,079
so when we are dealing with indicators

244
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,639
so we can actually select a coefficient

245
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,079
we'll assign to each of these tags

246
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,440
and the tag that

247
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,200
has the highest weight will be

248
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,079
considered the most dangerous

249
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,519
um

250
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,440
the next important consideration is how

251
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,240
relevant or up to date this indicator is

252
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,519
for example

253
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,279
we're learning about this you know

254
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,800
phishing indicator there's no guarantee

255
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,040
it will be relevant say in a year

256
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,720
indicators wrought over time we need to

257
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,360
factor it in

258
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,959
the premier league

259
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,880
university

260
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,120
there's

261
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,809
[Music]

262
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,120
take into account

263
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,000
when it was last contributed

264
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,320
gives us

265
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,199
there is a coefficient

266
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,760
which shows which represents you know

267
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,920
the rotting time so to speak it could be

268
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,519
10 days or

269
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:32,639
for a month

270
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,519
like the hashes we can can consider up

271
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,600
to date for five years but addresses

272
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,639
maybe for just a couple of days

273
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,240
again much is really a judgment call of

274
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,120
the user here

275
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,920
these parameters we can also quantify we

276
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,600
have this information

277
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,920
we get the indicators we track when we

278
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,680
last saw them we have all these

279
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,160
parameters

280
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,279
indicating

281
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,079
now please remember that an indicator is

282
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,758
more than a string in a text file

283
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,120
if it's a domain then somebody must have

284
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,880
registered it

285
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,959
if we collect these parameters we can

286
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,040
actually adjust our assessment

287
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,600
now let's analyze individual entities

288
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
and discuss what kind of additional

289
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,120
parameters we may want to use

290
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,800
the errors here show

291
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,560
how a given parameter

292
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,839
should impact

293
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,199
the parameter

294
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,399
a red arrow means that the score should

295
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,880
increase

296
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,560
so we can collect statistics on

297
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,119
you know which

298
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,079
but please note

299
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,240
that it should be rather an additional

300
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,680
consideration

301
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,279
it should not be the prime

302
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,680
determinant so to speak i mean it should

303
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,279
impact your score but it shouldn't

304
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,199
impact it too much

305
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,440
what's too much means i will say at the

306
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,400
end of my presentation

307
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,400
with an ip address we can check which

308
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,880
cloud provider this ap address belongs

309
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,079
to

310
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,919
if it's say amazon aws or microsoft asia

311
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,640
or yandex cloud

312
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,480
chances are there will be lots of false

313
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,240
positives there right because there are

314
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,000
lots of companies there there are lots

315
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
of virtual machines

316
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,160
so false positives are very probable

317
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,120
the resources say of ib info.com

318
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,880
you check how many domain names

319
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,160
are actually

320
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,360
associated with a particular asn and if

321
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,200
you realize like millions of them this

322
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,559
must be a provider

323
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,080
and then you should be able to adjust

324
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,480
the weight

325
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,720
also ip addresses can be associated with

326
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,039
some public resources such as public

327
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,200
mail service public dns service public

328
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,240
networks and sub networks of uh vpn

329
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,720
providers

330
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,559
all these parameters will also impact

331
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,240
the score more than a max mine to buy

332
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,760
azure sports api

333
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,440
you can for example maximize databases

334
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,840
and other geo tags so to speak so for

335
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,400
example you can check country reputation

336
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,039
just like with asm it's not a very

337
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,039
reliable parameter so it should not be

338
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,799
the key determinant for the score

339
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,200
once uh you know we collect information

340
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,840
on them

341
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,280
we can check uh who is uh

342
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,000
information if there is a no entry there

343
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,679
this domain

344
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,200
must have been delegated and we can

345
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,600
lower the score if there is an entry

346
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,240
means that you know the domain is live

347
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,000
age of domain is another important

348
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,760
parameter

349
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,400
so for example this domain may have been

350
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,640
recently registered for some malicious

351
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,400
activities such as phishing

352
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,880
or

353
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,720
you know it may provide false positives

354
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,039
because you know there may be some

355
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,240
mailchimp at the very top

356
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,280
next we can look at dns entries

357
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,520
if there is an entry in front of this

358
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,320
domain well maybe it's uh

359
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,480
no i'm sorry for the reason entry it

360
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,240
must be a live one

361
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,600
tld writing can also be extracted but

362
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,559
again

363
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,399
did not rely too much on this parameter

364
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,280
among alexa top or whatever it doesn't

365
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,280
really mean

366
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,280
it cannot be hacked

367
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,280
or abused

368
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,120
so this parameter should not be given

369
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,280
too much weight either it should not be

370
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,240
the key determinant for score correction

371
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,799
i mean you can use this information but

372
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,440
be careful

373
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,039
if we get a potentially malicious url

374
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,480
we can follow it

375
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,039
and see what the server returns

376
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,559
if the web server

377
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,240
tells us it's like 200 301.

378
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,080
well it's live so we need to take into

379
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,280
account

380
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,320
like 400 and above codes or no response

381
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,640
whatsoever probably mean that the url is

382
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,320
dead and we can lower the score

383
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,840
certificates

384
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,480
if the certificate if the url is alive

385
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,559
we can get their certificates and we can

386
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,960
study the

387
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,200
another possible but not so reliable

388
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,720
because certificates can be reissued

389
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,400
so we can take the domain out of url

390
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,880
and see if this domain can be found in

391
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,440
our database our kind of writing we

392
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,799
previously associated with

393
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,159
on the same domain

394
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,960
you can have several malicious urls and

395
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,640
you may want to use this information for

396
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,919
scoring purposes as well

397
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,720
such as hashes

398
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,000
without association with a particular

399
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,480
hash if all you see is just a file name

400
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,000
and you're assuming it's the name of

401
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,880
some

402
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,480
malicious phone

403
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,720
you may want to double check that it's

404
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,159
unique because if it's calc dot exist

405
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,039
without the hash it's very easy to

406
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,640
confuse it

407
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,799
with a good calc exa file in the system

408
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,039
or

409
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,360
so how are we going to transform all

410
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,000
these parameters into a metric well in

411
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,559
fact it can be done in a pretty simple

412
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,360
way we grab all the parameters we have

413
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,240
and we rank them by importance

414
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,919
in other words we

415
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,760
select

416
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,640
certain coefficients

417
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,840
[Music]

418
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,200
of some of these parameters will be at

419
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,760
the very top because they have maximum

420
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,919
impact on the score and

421
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,080
once at the bottom of this they have

422
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,120
minimum impact

423
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,360
i'm also showing coefficients here on

424
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,480
the left

425
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,320
so a coefficient is a value that you

426
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,600
know can

427
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,159
range from minus five to plus five or

428
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,760
maybe from minus one to plus one

429
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,840
and then we summarize

430
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,080
now the most interesting thing the

431
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,559
formula itself

432
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,840
if uh

433
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,520
selected parameters properly if we've

434
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,720
assigned proper weights

435
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,000
if we have assessed the potential impact

436
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,760
of each of the parameters on a given

437
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,440
indicator

438
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,120
we can actually make deal with this very

439
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,679
simple formula actually this formula has

440
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,279
been used you know for production

441
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,840
purposes for 18 months

442
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,960
and we are quite happy with this

443
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,240
performance

444
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,760
all the parameters i talked about are

445
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,640
represented here there's a consolidated

446
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,840
uh trust level

447
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,520
parameter

448
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,000
parameters also representing

449
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,799
the type of malicious activity and the

450
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,360
context here

451
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,679
and finally the parameter representing

452
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,080
like how up-to-date this indicator is

453
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,760
the one that actually makes sure that

454
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,720
you know this uh score rots over time is

455
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,440
rv um

456
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,000
and that will tell us if it's any good

457
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,960
or if it is you

458
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,639
submitted by four sources

459
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,279
in monitoring c2c servers of ransomware

460
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,440
their website

461
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,679
you know communicated here is does not

462
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,960
belong to any well-known

463
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,600
data or the storage time is 10 days

464
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,320
okay this effectively means

465
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,640
you know

466
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,760
since it's a trusted source

467
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,039
it's sc is 100 like we know they are

468
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,000
researchers we know they provide ibs

469
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,799
with context

470
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,320
so probably you know the ip comes

471
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,600
together with the name of some

472
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,240
ransomware

473
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,279
have the highest priority in terms of

474
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,039
threats and in our formula we

475
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,200
which means that at the moment this

476
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,440
indicator of compromise i'm sorry this

477
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,159
indicator at least will have a score of

478
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,720
59.

479
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,960
now had we only received it had we

480
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,960
received it today and the last

481
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,720
coefficient would have been one and it

482
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,880
would stand at 100.

483
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,520
two days later

484
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,520
it will turn to zero

485
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,480
formula

486
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,240
this indicator will no longer be

487
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,240
considered

488
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,159
moreover it's not clear if it is

489
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,399
associated with any malware

490
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:49,039
or any particular cyber criminal group

491
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,279
we started

492
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,240
you know

493
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,919
enriching it and it turned out that the

494
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,039
ip belongs to amazon aws

495
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,559
which means that we are probably going

496
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,399
to see lots of false positives there

497
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,799
also notes that best indicator we have

498
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,679
never seen before

499
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,399
which means you know formula the value

500
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,120
will be very low

501
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,120
i mean human logic would suggest

502
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,960
which is like negligibly low level

503
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,240
means we shouldn't even be looking at it

504
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,640
under normal conditions

505
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,399
like if we don't have any additional

506
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,520
contextual information

507
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,720
sleeping

508
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,399
the square that we get from the formula

509
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,039
is a way of communication it's important

510
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,240
for us

511
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,559
for the users of the system

512
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,879
to be crystal clear about what it means

513
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,760
i want to make sure that all those who

514
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,279
are using it who don't know how the

515
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,640
model works

516
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,120
or maybe forgot about the formula

517
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,559
would still know how to respond

518
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,600
usual colors for a scale like this

519
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,840
because it's really simplifies

520
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,480
understanding

521
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,080
low medium high

522
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,080
you can name this ranges

523
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,880
if this is your preference

524
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,360
formula

525
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,520
so we've developed our formula we've

526
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,880
tested it on synthetic data

527
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,720
actually the formula can be tested in

528
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,760
excel

529
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,120
um

530
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,880
so you play with the inputs there's

531
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,679
you absolutely need to test it in real

532
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:08,960
life

533
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,679
and see what kind of distribution

534
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,640
it will generate

535
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,640
it is indeed very important to take a

536
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,320
test sample and manually check

537
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,200
the performance of the formula

538
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,279
and then if you like it you know you can

539
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,679
double check and certainly we can as a

540
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,279
developer of the formula we can double

541
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,600
check the ranges

542
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,080
i should cover how the whole system

543
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,360
works

544
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,679
so first

545
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,279
i'm sorry we connect and use sources

546
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,840
we indicate our initial

547
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,000
by looking at how this source of data

548
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,519
works

549
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,200
now what uh the uh specialization series

550
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,519
next we start collecting indicators

551
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,039
and we have many

552
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,480
sources like this

553
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,799
that's why the same indicator may be

554
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,600
submitted by several sources at the same

555
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,399
time

556
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,399
when we get indicators from different

557
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,640
sources we can calculate

558
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,840
consolidated confidence or

559
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,840
the integral confidence level

560
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,760
and i showed the formula for that before

561
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,679
next we do enrichment

562
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,519
we reach our indicator

563
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,679
with the information we need

564
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,279
in order to obtain parameters

565
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,960
where you know the level of threats and

566
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,440
the context

567
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,080
once we've enriched it

568
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,399
we can actually use our local sources

569
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,559
and statistics for enrichment

570
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,480
but also we can use

571
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,200
external sources such as dna sentries

572
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,840
and who is servers but we can also use

573
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,159
analytical reports

574
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,440
and tlt ratings ratings of

575
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,080
malicious domains and various is n

576
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,559
rankings

577
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,200
published by various threat intelligence

578
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,720
companies

579
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,600
next we calculate the threat metric

580
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,679
next we calculate the environment metric

581
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,279
the environment value

582
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,880
next we calculate uh you know how

583
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,840
rotten it is we calculate rv and then we

584
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,039
come up with a final score

585
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,080
and then you know we go from the numerix

586
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,640
score to a recommendation

587
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,679
like high lower medium

588
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,279
and there is some feedback built into it

589
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,918
you know the false positives

590
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,199
associated with this other source

591
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,599
we should be able to adjust our

592
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,040
coefficients

593
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,440
thus changing the amount of trust we are

594
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,879
putting in the source

595
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,800
and thus new indicators will already be

596
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,239
adjusted so to speak thank you very much

597
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:34,040
your questions please

598
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,359
um

599
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,800
would you like to promote it in the

600
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,560
community i mean the weights without

601
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,079
your signing

602
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,800
and the second question is that since it

603
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,240
does look like cvss

604
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,599
would it make sense

605
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,280
to use other contextual metrics besides

606
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,640
the ones you've told us about

607
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,720
that would you know really show how

608
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,720
important that score would be for a

609
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,040
specific organization

610
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,079
a great question thank you so

611
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,480
that would be relevant for a given

612
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,839
company or a given industry

613
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,320
you know and some scores can easily be

614
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,880
calculated by vendors because they don't

615
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,280
really depend on a particular industry

616
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,000
or environment

617
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,960
i mean this can

618
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,160
that the client would need to have a cm

619
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,400
system or something else that will

620
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,079
introduce its own corrections

621
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,839
can actually do a recalculation so to

622
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:16,960
speak

623
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,960
to reflect the needs of a particular

624
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,400
industry

625
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,320
but adapting to a particular company

626
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,520
could be difficult for the vendor

627
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,520
which is the case for cbss absolutely

628
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,280
but you know we are addressing the same

629
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,119
problem that we're doing it in a similar

630
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,280
way

631
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,040
i think we can consider

632
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,599
making this way it's uh public

633
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,040
you know the stuff i previously told you

634
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,800
about vendors try to keep hush hush

635
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,480
we can we can consider it i guess

636
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,800
so you mentioned

637
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,880
that for domain scoring you know you

638
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,200
will take the domain out so to speak and

639
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,040
then you will be checking the domain

640
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,800
score

641
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,000
and the question is technical

642
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,920
effectively you need to perform this

643
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,160
scoring twice

644
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,839
does it make the whole process much

645
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,160
longer

646
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,399
do you cache this information

647
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,359
well when we extract these parameters

648
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,000
you know some parameters require that we

649
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,160
turn to thoughts party information like

650
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,200
who is or dns that takes time

651
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,200
like if you have the infrastructure if

652
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,440
you do multi-threading you can minimize

653
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,520
this time without caching it would be

654
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,160
indeed difficult

655
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,079
you know we may have an sla of 10

656
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:06,960
minutes

657
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,800
to actually double check everything and

658
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,480
then reach our indicator with the right

659
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,640
parameters but if we don't have the lag

660
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,000
like this

661
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,320
then we have to rely quite heavily on

662
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,320
caching

663
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,359
you know it's an indirect

664
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,079
parameter now for example

665
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,040
google drive we got a malicious link to

666
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,320
google drive documents

667
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,680
probably you know google drive wouldn't

668
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,280
even be there

669
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,920
but you know other parameters related to

670
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,160
for example the number of malicious urls

671
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,680
on this domain

672
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,680
you know they will be triggered i hope

673
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,720
i've answered your question

674
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,240
yes

675
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,959
you have but

676
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,720
and i did mention

677
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,599
the volume for a reason we are talking

678
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,440
about millions of indicators per day

679
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,320
stuff you can find online obviously you

680
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,960
can now do it manually

681
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,040
so we have

682
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,079
from trusted sources such as ti reports

683
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,560
sources that state very clearly this is

684
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,760
based on

685
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,079
serious research

686
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,359
like for them

687
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:02,079
we may want you know to

688
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,640
pay more attention read and manually

689
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,319
analyze them in more detail for

690
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:07,440
everything else

691
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,280
we'll absolutely have to rely on

692
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,560
automation

693
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,119
because manual processing of millions of

694
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,160
entries

695
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,598
a day is impossible

696
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,160
so i can say that scoring itself can

697
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,400
actually be construed as two different

698
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,560
streams one is when you're dealing with

699
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,319
the trusted sources where you do you

700
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:27,200
know

701
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,640
don't do validation but you do

702
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,760
enrichment

703
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,000
and the automated thoughts with the not

704
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,880
so trusted sources

705
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,880
statistics

706
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,119
i'm

707
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:43,300
[Music]

708
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,359
because after you told us about

709
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,839
your methodology

710
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:53,440
he has become very clear to everybody

711
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,440
like how we can attack your system

712
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,319
how are you going to defend against that

713
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,839
is

714
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,000
that in most cases it will be coming

715
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,680
from different sources

716
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,560
hence

717
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,119
cross-validation

718
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,800
that's why we actually have you know a

719
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,160
parameter for

720
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,879
combined thrust

721
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,560
maybe having more trust associated with

722
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:51,040
them will possibly tell us this is bogus

723
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,839
for example

724
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,640
you know we can connect a special source

725
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,280
that's uh you know we have a designed

726
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,359
you know for this test

727
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,760
and it can be providing us with lists of

728
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,680
ips with text like

729
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,960
poor skin

730
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,560
but some other source will be telling us

731
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,800
no this is not for scanning immediately

732
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,040
these are cnc's of some botnets

733
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:30,400
but do you have statistics

734
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,359
that would show you know

735
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,520
the evolution of the share of sources

736
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,920
that have high level of trust

737
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,000
yes we have the statistics i think i

738
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,079
actually shared the statistics last year

739
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,000
in fact your question is more like uh

740
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,280
what's the

741
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:52,000
life cycle of various iocs and lines

742
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,880
our stats at the moment are such that uh

743
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,359
malicious

744
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,680
average lifetime is like three days and

745
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,839
this is the median

746
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,520
time

747
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,160
for domains that were like five days for

748
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,760
urls

749
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,960
it will be like five to six days

750
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,280
and hushes obviously have a much longer

751
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,839
life cycle

752
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:22,359
uh

753
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,480
written down some metrics that seem to

754
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,520
impact your score

755
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,960
associated threats and environmental

756
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:43,920
they seem to drive your scores

757
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,920
now for network ios

758
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,480
like uh is it public or is it part of a

759
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,720
cloud and so on

760
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,319
i see there are lots of parameters there

761
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,880
so how does one come up with the right

762
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,599
metrics so that you know we

763
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,319
have a sensible formula

764
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:07,359
like how many or how much data do we

765
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:09,280
need to

766
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,280
process so to speak before we can

767
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,040
release it into production and the

768
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,319
second question is

769
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,319
do we need to come up with it with a

770
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,160
default score

771
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:23,319
if enrichment has not given us anything

772
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,800
the more metrics you have impacting the

773
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,400
level of threat the better

774
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,440
well because you know this way you can

775
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,640
get a very fine-tuned square

776
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,839
i have listed here some very simple

777
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,560
metrics which uh it should be very easy

778
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,160
to check online rather than you know

779
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,359
waiting for five days

780
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,119
for example there is this issue

781
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:06,240
like if you start asking who is server

782
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,160
every time you will be banned very

783
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,359
quickly

784
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:10,079
for

785
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,079
areas like france

786
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,040
and some who is servers will not

787
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,480
return

788
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,200
your queries

789
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,160
however you need to double check if this

790
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,880
particular metric is any good

791
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,640
at representing the threat level

792
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:40,160
associated with this ioc

793
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,839
remind me a second question defaults all

794
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:48,160
right we really need to use indicators

795
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,119
like this in other words

796
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:52,640
if we are talking about real-time

797
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,200
processing

798
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,240
well we calculated you know we identify

799
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,240
indicators

800
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:14,880
sort of you know accept the indicator

801
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,640
together with the score together with

802
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,200
the other things and this indicators may

803
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,160
be unimportant on their own

804
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,040
but you know they may prove to be useful

805
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,599
for further analysis

806
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,440
something interesting about a connection

807
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,839
between uh different pieces of malware

808
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:45,920
or different groups

809
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,760
so you don't have to use in real time

810
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,599
but you know collecting this information

811
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,100
makes a lot of sense another question

812
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,359
[Music]

813
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:56,359
question

814
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,599
we find ourselves in a situation where

815
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,760
we are processing lots and lots of

816
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,240
parameters

817
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:05,520
and

818
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,319
what we have is effectively an ml model

819
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:11,359
because we got so many parameters

820
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,040
it's impossible to get an expert

821
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,920
assessment on them

822
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,000
i'm sorry

823
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,599
you know it's such a such a jungle

824
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,839
that ml would actually do a better job

825
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:25,599
of it but we are still trying to do it

826
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:28,160
manually

827
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,960
what i'm talking about is very much like

828
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,640
feature selection

829
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,119
which is a preparatory stage when you

830
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,200
develop a neural network right

831
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,599
and the coefficients that we chose well

832
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,079
they would be weights in a

833
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:51,599
neural network

834
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:53,040
i would still need to choose the

835
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,359
architecture here right

836
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,040
i would go for a convolutional network

837
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,520
for sure

838
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:02,079
now what i've described here is very

839
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,160
much like ml for sure but i've been

840
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,520
describing

841
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,760
the system that we have

842
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,160
and with our system you know we like it

843
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,240
that we understand very well what's

844
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,800
happening in sight

845
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,599
i think it's logical to assume that the

846
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:20,079
next evolutionary step would be a

847
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,640
transition to ml maybe next year i will

848
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,559
be delivering a report on that i think

849
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:27,359
we are close to such a transition

850
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:30,078
last question then

851
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,480
about uh

852
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,800
yes

853
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:15,280
thank you for the report i have just a

854
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,000
short single question

855
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,920
so you say that your system has been in

856
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,400
production for 18 months my practical

857
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,160
question is like this

858
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,839
how do you correct the whites

859
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,079
a trigger for weight correction is

860
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:35,839
feedback

861
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:39,279
and there are two types of feedback

862
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,359
it can be a response or feedback from

863
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:44,960
the clients you know they can get in

864
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,880
touch with us and say this is a false

865
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:47,920
positive

866
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,839
oh we actually have an api for that

867
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,119
and we will obviously investigate the

868
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,119
false positives that will look at you

869
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,280
know which particular sources generate

870
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,520
this false positive so we will double

871
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,640
check him

872
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,240
so far we are doing it manually

873
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,200
so we we grab a source we do you know a

874
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,119
test sample of indicators coming from it

875
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:12,640
and then we look at how many false

876
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,800
positives it has provided and then on

877
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,440
the basis of this check we will adjust

878
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,520
the weight sometime later like two or

879
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,839
three months after this adjustment we

880
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:23,359
will revisit it

881
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,800
again

882
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,200
in order to decide whether we need to

883
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,119
you know lower their weight even further

884
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:30,880
or maybe increase it

885
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,640
because you know sometimes you know with

886
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,520
some sources they will be generating

887
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,839
lots of false positives for a short

888
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:39,280
period of time and then they go back to

889
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,839
normal

890
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:48,399
so this is how we adjust the weights

891
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:52,839
what

892
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:54,559
is

893
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:56,400
in order to automate this feedback

894
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,520
process

895
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,520
you know we still need to find a

896
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,640
solution we are thinking about it

897
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,040
thank you

898
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:09,800
more questions

899
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,959
hello

900
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,839
supplier of information and i know

901
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:39,520
nothing about them i don't know how they

902
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,079
score it you know what kind of

903
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,240
weights they're using

904
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,559
i know nothing about their formulas or

905
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,079
metrics

906
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:51,839
what's the golden standard here

907
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:54,160
what are the criteria

908
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,480
by as user

909
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,800
could check

910
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,960
if you know my supplier is doing a good

911
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,960
job

912
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,480
may i actually use your formula

913
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,760
maybe in a simplified manner

914
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,000
you know to double check my information

915
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
providers

916
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:33,680
so if you've got a russian

917
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,920
based uh feed supplier you can just turn

918
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,240
to them and they should tell you it's a

919
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,799
normal question

920
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,440
do get in touch with vendors and then

921
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,119
depending on what they tell you you know

922
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,319
you can make a judgment call

923
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,839
the second one

924
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:51,839
uh would involve collection of your own

925
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,240
statistics so you get this feed document

926
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,000
from the vendor

927
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,480
you see how many false positives

928
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,520
there are

929
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,400
say in a month

930
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,200
and then with this stats you can turn to

931
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,160
the vendor and ask him

932
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,720
assessing the quality of scoring without

933
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,400
involving the vendor

934
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,160
i don't really know how to do that

935
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,760
i think that it is in such a discussion

936
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,319
you can learn of ways of uh addressing

937
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:25,040
it

938
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,800
and chances are you

939
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,359
will wants to adjust your processes

940
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:32,799
rather than vendors processes

941
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,960
second question

942
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,599
can you use a dumbed down version of my

943
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:43,280
formula well this is a public

944
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,440
presentation you can certainly are

945
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,040
welcome to use this formula

946
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,280
another question

947
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,800
and we still have five minutes left

948
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:11,079
it's a short question

949
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,280
well the right and the beautiful answer

950
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,400
to your question is

951
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,799
reports from different vendors

952
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,799
so to speak their view

953
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:55,359
on the longevity of indicators in the

954
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:57,680
world

955
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,960
so far we are working with this uh blue

956
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,520
delta of 025

957
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:12,960
now if you want a more profound answer

958
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,680
please consult the article

959
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,240
because if i start repeating it it will

960
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:21,479
take forever

961
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,880
i don't see any more hands

962
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,799
thank you so much

963
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:28,400
thanks for your interest and have a

964
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,559
great day
