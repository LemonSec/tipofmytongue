1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,839
i'm sergey kopinski and i'm a researcher

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,720
for infotax

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,120
and i study fishing domain names and

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,880
type squatting using the strings

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,720
if we would like to

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,480
find domain names

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,760
that

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,000
look

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,480
similar to popular resources the ones

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,400
that are not noticeable by the user

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,559
oh you know it

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,600
usage of such domains

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,480
is

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,840
called typesquoting for typos

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,280
and here are three domain names

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,600
each days info tax and costs login

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,399
the all the options are available for

18
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,719
purchase

19
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,120
let me describe how those domain names

20
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,839
are created

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,438
type squats and techniques from

22
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,840
literature are you know adding symbols

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,479
in random places

24
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,479
repeating the symbols

25
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,390
adding some

26
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,520
[Music]

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,080
leading characters changing one bit

28
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,159
replacing two neighboring symbols on the

29
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,640
keyboard

30
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,400
replacing the symbols to the ones that

31
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,600
look

32
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,439
very similar

33
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,040
replacing

34
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,079
the vowels

35
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,240
emission of symbols and putting them

36
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,320
in different places so what's the idea

37
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,720
first of all you need to create the list

38
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,920
of

39
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,399
protected domains

40
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,439
by using the types quoting methods

41
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,439
you might need to generate

42
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,320
those fishing domains

43
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,639
decide how you compare them

44
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,958
and

45
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,000
find domains that are close to the ones

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,760
that you are trying to protect

47
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,840
so let's use this as a plan

48
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,480
first of all if we create

49
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,200
a list of domains to protect

50
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,280
what should we focus on we should not

51
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,120
focus on everything on the internet but

52
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,560
probably on some

53
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,440
important sites right

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,120
so

55
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,280
whether it's top sides popular site

56
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,680
banking sites

57
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,800
government services

58
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,760
corporate domains

59
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,720
the sources might be

60
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,800
different companies from top lists

61
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,239
majestic selects etc or the user

62
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,959
statistics

63
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,280
after you define the list of those

64
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,879
you can generate

65
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,200
using

66
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,599
a utility

67
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,680
github hazard dns twist

68
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,640
it's a

69
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,680
an open source utility that allows for a

70
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,280
given domain name

71
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,080
to generate a lot of similar

72
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,519
permutations of domain

73
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,159
it can also ping them by dns and find

74
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,959
similar domains it works as a command

75
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,400
line utility

76
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,440
as a python module

77
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,840
as a web page

78
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,959
you can

79
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,000
put your site there and scan

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
and

81
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,120
a spoiler is that that there will be a

82
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,200
lot of them

83
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,440
next

84
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,720
we now need to understand how we can

85
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,920
compare the domains

86
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,239
we can measure the distance between

87
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,200
the

88
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,400
symbols

89
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,640
and

90
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,120
we might define it as

91
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,360
an inverted space between the symbols

92
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,839
there are different ways but the tamara

93
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,040
levenstein one is interesting

94
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,040
it's the measure of difference between

95
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,600
two strings that is defined by

96
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,320
the amount of operations of removal

97
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,120
replacement

98
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,199
and transposition

99
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,160
of the two nearby symbols that are

100
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,880
needed to transform one string into

101
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,479
another so it's very similar to what the

102
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,280
type squatting

103
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,320
people do right

104
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,040
when you have everything defined

105
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,960
you just need to

106
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,400
develop a technique to

107
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,440
find those fishing domains

108
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,440
and find the distance between

109
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,680
the target domain

110
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,560
and the protected domains

111
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,720
so we calculate the distance

112
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,320
and find the minimum one

113
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,639
we had a hypothesis

114
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,440
that

115
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,120
for fishing domains

116
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,199
this measure will be small

117
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,199
and for non-fishing

118
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,800
it will be high

119
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,440
and this is how it can be they can be

120
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,880
delimited

121
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,000
so

122
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,240
we need to prepare the steps create a

123
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,720
list of the protected domains generate

124
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,919
permutations calculate the number the

125
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,199
distance

126
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,520
and based on that array to find

127
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,919
the values

128
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,799
and the thresholds

129
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,720
here you just need to calculate the

130
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,080
distance and the two rules are if

131
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,240
it's zero then it's one of the protected

132
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,840
domains

133
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,199
if it's

134
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,680
not equal to zero then we need to decide

135
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,600
whether it's more or less than the

136
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,199
threshold

137
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,759
if it's more than a threshold then it's

138
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,479
some other domain that we don't consider

139
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,520
a domain that's been protected

140
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,600
and our sweet spot where we do our

141
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,759
production is

142
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,400
when the distance is more than zero but

143
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,800
less than some threshold

144
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,199
so we gathered some data

145
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,440
like the top 500 sites for example

146
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,160
this is the number of objects

147
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,520
we've created

148
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,280
1.5 million pseudo fishing domains

149
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,720
1.2 and 2 threshold calculation and 300k

150
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,199
for testing

151
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,080
and also i added 3

152
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,440
100

153
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,240
uh others for from alexa top million

154
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,319
so we calculate the distance for the

155
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,360
that

156
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,680
1.2 million

157
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,599
blue ones

158
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,479
find the threshold

159
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,560
the max the red line is too high

160
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,800
and

161
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,360
the balanced ones are on 99 percent hill

162
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,720
the violet

163
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,759
and the green one is the box plot top

164
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,120
and let's add our test domains here

165
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,319
my fishing domains and

166
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,599
the distributions are

167
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,919
very discreet

168
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,960
threshold is too high

169
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,878
then recall is one and precision is

170
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,879
though and two others are more balanced

171
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,840
so the accuracy for

172
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,280
max is 0.6 i have a 1.0 recall but the

173
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,479
precision is zero point five

174
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,039
it

175
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,639
if i allow myself to

176
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,559
lose one percent of them then the

177
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,919
precision accuracy much higher

178
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,360
the idea of my presentation was that

179
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,839
this method allows for

180
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,080
finding domain names that are

181
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,399
type squatting

182
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,519
and

183
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,040
we can work

184
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,839
ahead

185
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,360
to

186
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,560
actually

187
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,000
decide

188
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,320
which domains might be

189
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,600
will be dangerous and

190
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,760
this method allows us to see whether

191
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,160
this domain name is a phishing one

192
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,640
or not

193
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,680
and besides asking

194
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,920
for a minimum

195
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,560
you can also

196
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,560
define the

197
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,640
the one that is that they are squatting

198
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,279
so like burbank online would look very

199
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,720
much like spare banks i tried

200
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,680
so finding purchasing and redirecting

201
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,120
people to legitimate uh domain might be

202
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,440
a good idea

203
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,360
registrars might

204
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,760
look for

205
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,399
such domains also

206
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,480
propose that

207
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,279
their purchase to the legal owners also

208
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,399
corporate emails

209
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,440
addresses not the best way but one of

210
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,480
the

211
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,800
good

212
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,760
rules to

213
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,920
actually base your rules on thanks for

214
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,079
the presentation

215
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,600
and the question is what do you do with

216
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,079
the sites that are aimed at an external

217
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,479
user

218
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,440
see

219
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,640
we've created an oil company site

220
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,000
and we're selling oil

221
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,279
there was

222
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,440
something that really happened

223
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,320
what do i do in that case

224
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,560
so imagine we have

225
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,439
an oil company

226
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,680
and the actors have

227
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,760
created a domain with a very similar

228
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,959
name

229
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,239
that they used to sell oil

230
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,880
sure

231
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,720
you need to to work with the authorities

232
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,399
to stop this

233
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,720
my technique was just comparing

234
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,360
the strings

235
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,920
yeah sorry i don't have the full

236
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,560
solution for you

237
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,720
we of course have all the contacts and

238
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,399
social networks so feel free to

239
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,320
subscribe

240
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,959
how do you run the validation so we got

241
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,920
those phishing domains and we know

242
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,680
what what is there

243
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,959
and i had an experience working with uh

244
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,320
the msd and automating that process

245
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,120
so you get 200 or 300 of those sites

246
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,279
checking for content or something else

247
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,319
this is one of the

248
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,079
features that you can use to for further

249
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,399
checks but it's not the the final

250
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,160
solution you can use the contents you

251
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,200
can

252
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,519
i don't have enough time to to explain

253
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,560
all the

254
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,760
potential

255
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,720
applications
