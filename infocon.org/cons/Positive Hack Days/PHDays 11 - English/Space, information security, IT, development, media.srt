1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,480
and beautiful unusual and interesting

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,320
guests will be with me and right now

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,080
we're going to speak not about cyber

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,679
security

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,359
not about cyber security but about

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,880
technologies

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,880
and we're going to speak about outer

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,760
space about its development

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,359
about it

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,880
and a little bit about informational

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,800
security

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,960
and i'm visited by alexander bowen chief

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,079
and editor about the outer space

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,480
sasha

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,520
sasha you just astonished me sitting in

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,160
this chair i just wanted to gossip with

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,680
you but you came with a big briefcase

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,800
with a teapot and with royal and uh

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,719
presentation inside of it can you show

20
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,719
me the presentation are we going to have

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,000
a presentation beautiful

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,000
okay so how are we going to follow the

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
presentation and you will ask me the

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,520
questions and i will make an appearance

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,199
like i'm speaking oh and by the way i

26
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,799
have a slide

27
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,159
so if you're going to speak about the

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,920
outer space

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,119
and we're going to speak about the outer

30
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,479
space why have not we get outside the

31
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,280
orbit of the earth are we so stupid as

32
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,320
humans

33
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,759
well first of all i would like to tell

34
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,280
you that

35
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,799
space

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,880
machines are

37
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,799
reaching the outskirts of the solar

38
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,799
system but they are automatic and

39
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,159
manless

40
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,920
and voyager 1 and voyager 2 still are

41
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,720
keeping connection with us unfortunately

42
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,600
they piloted flights

43
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,880
we are still staying in a land orbit

44
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,799
earth orbit we don't have mega gold in

45
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:55,119
1960s uh we had the worst situation with

46
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,799
electronics but hackers could not break

47
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,280
anything

48
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,280
sasha in my ear i have the news we are

49
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,399
in a news room i'm sorry but i will stop

50
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,280
you

51
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,280
you're speaking about the outer space

52
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,639
and i'm speaking about informational

53
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,520
security right now the red line will get

54
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,200
around me okay attention to the screen

55
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,040
attention to the screen and i'm being

56
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,959
informed

57
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,480
from our

58
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,560
chili types

59
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,520
that in our virtual state there was an

60
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,920
attack it's not that i'm really happy

61
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,760
was able to get inside of oil and gas

62
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,120
company and they've launched traditional

63
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,360
encoder virus well peter came to our

64
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,440
state

65
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,360
later we're going to learn about more

66
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,560
details because the defenders

67
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,120
right now are investigating this

68
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,920
incident and we need a little time for

69
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,720
this

70
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,560
and we're going to come back together

71
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,440
with sasha to our space

72
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,440
let's forget about the

73
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,319
earthly things and we'll fly back to the

74
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,000
outer space

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,480
not enough of motivation previously the

76
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,040
soviet union and united states

77
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,680
made countries spend any money and they

78
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,519
were able to land on the moon

79
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,159
so in order for us to fly better and

80
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,159
faster and further we need to have a

81
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,640
competitor not competitor we need to

82
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,799
have goals i'm speaking about goals and

83
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,000
on the next slide i will speak about

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,519
goals but we don't have enough goals

85
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,360
right now it's too expensive

86
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,480
and if martian automatic missions cost

87
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,760
like 2.5 billion dollars

88
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,640
james webb telescope

89
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,159
and everybody been speaking about how

90
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,200
was it flying and it was expected by

91
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,799
russian one

92
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,040
it came here and it says well the russia

93
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,599
was here

94
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,480
so it was 10 billion dollars what about

95
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,879
spectrum

96
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,080
well i've been asking this question

97
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,760
today but i don't know because americans

98
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,799
they have more open financial reports

99
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,080
and it's much simpler for them to

100
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,159
calculate but in russia it's always

101
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,918
approximate numbers because

102
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,880
the money are invested and ruble is

103
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,919
fluctuating because it's volatile etc

104
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,240
etc

105
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,440
but i have prepared calculations of

106
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,080
how much a super uh spaceship costs

107
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,520
they said that they will make it for

108
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,759
trillion rubles it's like 16 billion

109
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,280
dollars

110
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,840
it seems like it's a

111
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,120
lot but without super heavy rocket human

112
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,960
cannot fly to the moon otherwise you

113
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,680
have to send several heavy rockets we do

114
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,000
have those plants but super heavy what

115
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,680
is the difference well

116
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,280
by the carrying capacity and how many

117
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,919
people can be in a super high

118
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,840
rocket well the average medium rocket

119
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,400
can take three people to the orbit

120
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,720
heavy rocket can take

121
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,520
two people and even three people around

122
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,639
the moon

123
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,440
and super heavy rocket

124
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,000
can deliver

125
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,320
this spaceship which will take them to

126
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,880
the orbit of the moon landing model will

127
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,560
land

128
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,000
everything is very simple if the

129
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,919
carrying capacity of the rocket is seven

130
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,039
tons it will be enough to launch gagarin

131
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,759
if the carrying capacity is 20 tons like

132
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,320
proton and garage

133
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,800
if you will try you can get around the

134
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,320
moon

135
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,639
but to land on the moon you need at

136
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,199
least 100 tones

137
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,960
or maybe 100 20 140.

138
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,680
i cannot imagine

139
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,960
yes we are going to speak about it and

140
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,239
speaking about the moon program

141
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,039
that was in 1960s 1970s

142
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,639
according well speaking about our money

143
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,680
it was 150 billion dollars even higher

144
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,840
and the same amount of money

145
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,080
was spent for the international space

146
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,280
station and this is the biggest space uh

147
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,560
man-made object in outer space

148
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,240
and this is the most expensive project

149
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,000
it's a bigger than big and drone

150
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,560
collider it's bigger than to hire this

151
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,639
place build this building this is also

152
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,440
about 150 billion dollars to build it

153
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,080
and

154
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,000
same amount of money to serve it and

155
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,240
maintain it

156
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,639
well it's the payment uh for being a

157
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,240
space uh species presumably photon

158
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,759
engine will be invented tomorrow

159
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,759
or some warp engines and they will say

160
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,160
we'll fly and we'll say we know what

161
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,400
should be expected because our space men

162
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,080
are well prepared for this but

163
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,319
unfortunately the point number three why

164
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,319
are not we flying outside of the earth

165
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,680
we don't have enough of breakthrough

166
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,759
technologies we're still flying with

167
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,520
chemical engines and we burn kerosene

168
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,120
methane in the oxygen or hydrogen in the

169
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,360
oxygen this is wonderful but this is

170
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,199
chemical

171
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,520
in order to bring up

172
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,280
five tons you have to burn 90 tons of

173
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,440
fuel it's understandable if you want to

174
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,680
fly far away

175
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,280
the size of the rocket will not be

176
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,199
sufficient

177
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,520
so we miss breakthrough technologies

178
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,520
a logical question

179
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,639
why why do we need for the prestige

180
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,639
we have not discovered a lot of things

181
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,280
on the earth we have a lot of

182
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,440
gaps and the white spots on the earth

183
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,360
well i haven't seen any white spot on

184
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,599
the map there are none

185
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,240
but you see

186
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,160
the bermuda triangle secret

187
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,759
ships are not

188
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,360
after we have launched lonnas they

189
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,280
stopped disappearing

190
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,879
they've been following our signal and

191
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,120
they're not disappearing

192
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,879
well i would like to tell you that if

193
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,280
you came to if you would come to phd

194
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,000
several years ago you would be uh

195
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,919
surprised they disappeared and there was

196
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,960
one competition dedicated to

197
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,680
how can we move the ship to the place

198
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,319
where it's never been and nobody would

199
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,160
notice it it's a wonderful interesting

200
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,120
topic and you know

201
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,360
your glonass

202
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,199
and very soon we're going to learn how

203
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,000
to teleport not us not us

204
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,839
yes i understand it's very secret but

205
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,719
nevertheless spectrum rg that our

206
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,640
telescope i've been speaking about which

207
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,799
is 1.5 million kilometers away from the

208
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,399
earth on the top picture with a big

209
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,160
fly two x-ray telescopes one thicker one

210
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,440
another thinner one and long one

211
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,320
and they can see black holes exploding

212
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,800
supernovas

213
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,959
almost the whole universe can be

214
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,040
investigated by it

215
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,760
and for example when american pioneers

216
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,120
been flying they've discovered that

217
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,360
they're flying a little bit slower than

218
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,040
they have to fly

219
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,600
is it a newton's law

220
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,680
having an error or maybe there is a some

221
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,200
breaking

222
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,120
environment that breaks them

223
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,120
before you fly you will never be able to

224
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,600
learn but ahead of themselves they've

225
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,640
been

226
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,040
lighting with infrared light to get the

227
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,200
signal and see what's ahead of them

228
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,600
and this beam it's very weak but it was

229
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,120
slowing them down

230
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,920
and it was measured so precisely that

231
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,240
this small breaking from infrared light

232
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,680
was measured and calculated

233
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,080
and they panicked because of it but when

234
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,680
they've been returning

235
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,080
was it pushing away well they flew away

236
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,720
too far away and i'm telling you because

237
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,880
you burn a lot of fuel

238
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,959
so you send it and you need the same

239
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,080
amount of fuel to turn back so the

240
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,839
ships are flying

241
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:02,839
for

242
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,760
good that's why we're not flying too

243
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,399
much we still hope to fly though we

244
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,800
still hope that in the year 2027 that we

245
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,800
will land on moon and somewhere in 30s

246
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,839
in 1930s 2030 2040 maybe

247
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,880
in 2027 even in 2026 they promise in

248
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,279
five yes we're going to land on the moon

249
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,680
so we're we're gonna be able to see it i

250
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,480
hope i hope that we'll see how people

251
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,279
land on mars we will we will we will

252
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,360
agree we will

253
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,320
yeah

254
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,160
so we also can fly to the moon

255
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,760
and it's empty

256
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,680
no

257
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,200
this year

258
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,760
there are plans to send a

259
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,720
station moon 25

260
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,320
it's going to have a

261
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,800
shower

262
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,000
it will get some regoliths and we'll see

263
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,880
how much ice is in the moon regolith

264
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,720
because there is a certain ice and some

265
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,640
of these uh

266
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,320
water has been brought from the earth

267
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,800
but nevertheless if you have water the

268
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,440
solar station you can decompose water

269
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,760
into the oxygen and hydrogen you can

270
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,800
breathe oxygen you can burn oxygen and

271
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,440
hydrogen you have the fuel

272
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,519
so i've told you so we need a lot of

273
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,800
fuel but if we can find it on the moon

274
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,880
then it's going to be wonderful

275
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,000
so we will manufacture you know gasoline

276
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,120
station in the outer space you see

277
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,600
so that will immediately be able to fly

278
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,760
somewhere else so if with light to the

279
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,160
moon how much of this hydrogen will you

280
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,160
need to fly

281
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,240
how far away can we fly

282
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,399
well we'll take a lot of free elite and

283
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,440
then it's going to be the end of the

284
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,480
moon

285
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,240
the moon is big one

286
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,800
it's very big

287
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,240
but can you imagine if the sigia

288
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,279
hydro

289
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,040
it has a solid nucleus in this ikea

290
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,279
and it has a lot of platinum

291
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,160
trillions of dollars of platinum

292
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,959
in

293
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,360
one side you say why do i need i have

294
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,040
some why do i need so much platinum on

295
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,560
the earth but platinum is a catalyzer

296
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,000
to combust

297
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,880
methane in oxygen

298
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,720
and of course of course of course for

299
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,200
the girls we are going to make the

300
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,880
biggest and the most beautiful

301
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,120
i'm speaking about catalyzers as a boy

302
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,440
but girls will have a lot of

303
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,680
jewelry and of course you know

304
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,000
one planet to another planet one planet

305
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,399
we take oxygen another planet hydrogen

306
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,160
another planet planet gives us some

307
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,519
metal and that's how we're going to

308
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,880
travel

309
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,959
and of course but we have not started

310
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,959
and we can compete in technologies to

311
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,959
show which country is better which

312
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,760
country is uh cooler for example x-ray

313
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,000
telescope we have

314
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,200
americans have a x-ray

315
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,519
telescope which looks at certain objects

316
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,680
and with a higher precision there's

317
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,040
hubble which makes beautiful pictures of

318
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,000
next galaxies

319
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,760
you're saying that competition here is

320
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,720
also very important

321
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,560
you know

322
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,320
they're trying to select directions

323
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,320
which are not over crossing for example

324
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,880
speaking about uh mars and moon we are

325
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,959
landing in different areas so that we

326
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,279
wouldn't research the same area so if

327
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,519
you will discover one in one area we

328
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,839
need to check another area and also on

329
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,839
the mars they're searching for

330
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,399
life signs of life and i'm going to tell

331
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,600
you about that

332
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,199
they're trying to land in different

333
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,880
areas in mars because they've landed in

334
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,120
one place on mars but if we're not lucky

335
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,600
that's it everybody will fly there no of

336
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,720
course

337
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,519
so it happens that

338
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,040
chinese for example

339
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,959
they're building their own orbital

340
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,440
station it's smaller but they were able

341
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,440
to land on mars and a mars

342
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,320
drone was have landed there russians

343
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,920
americans they were not able to do that

344
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,600
they have several attempts but they did

345
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,760
it from the first attempt which happens

346
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,360
that americans

347
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,959
say that we can do it this way china is

348
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,480
safe we can do it this way and russians

349
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,560
say we can do it that way

350
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,600
and

351
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,839
these competitions not like everybody's

352
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,120
running in the same direction but

353
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,959
everybody's bolstering

354
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,719
of different beautiful dresses

355
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,639
but the problem is that we are flying

356
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,880
too slowly to deliver a person to the

357
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,680
mosque and to fly him back you need two

358
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,040
yes

359
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,440
generally with modern technologies he

360
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,320
will try we can go for that and

361
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,720
if it's going to work but it's going to

362
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,680
cost trillion dollars a lot a lot of

363
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,800
money

364
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,120
so if you'll recalculate it into the old

365
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,120
money and i'll tell you the moon program

366
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,000
was 125 billions

367
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
for america

368
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,240
but the budget was smaller so if you

369
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,000
will calculate

370
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,040
which share from the american budget

371
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,720
so it happens that one trillion dollars

372
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,120
today

373
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,959
it's uh

374
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,600
these are the same money as 125 billions

375
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,040
there so it's the same amount of the

376
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,839
budget but back then they had to get

377
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,600
ahead of the soviet union because soviet

378
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,440
union was the first in the space the

379
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,839
first man in space they first came out

380
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,839
in outer space and they've been so

381
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,160
offended why

382
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,600
they've been ready for everything but

383
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,000
right now right i'm telling you

384
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,399
americans are saying that well they will

385
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,040
land in 1935 or 1936 on mars

386
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,000
but okay by nine by 2040

387
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,120
nobody's in a hurry like chinese can

388
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,880
land on the marks okay let's do it first

389
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,079
to the moon both of us

390
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,040
because we are very slow in space so how

391
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,399
can we fast

392
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,759
fly faster

393
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,759
musk builds a built uh spaceship

394
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,360
and its main advantage is not that it's

395
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,279
powerful well the powerful rockets have

396
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,120
been built before

397
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,000
but it's going to return back

398
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,519
which happens you know i've told you

399
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,079
that outer space is very expensive so he

400
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,440
tries to make it cheaper because the

401
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,880
fuel is also not very cheap but the fuel

402
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,720
is like a certain percentage from the

403
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,639
cost of the the first one is engines uh

404
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,560
so he does it in such a way so that the

405
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,720
rocket flies there flies back it's

406
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,480
getting charged and then it flies again

407
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,320
don't you know what happened

408
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,959
our system was broken

409
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,560
no it was a joke

410
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,360
so this system that breaks the system

411
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,600
has been broken

412
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,279
okay good good good

413
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,639
so

414
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,120
we can make a big rocket

415
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,040
which

416
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,759
will return back

417
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,600
and you will spend money only for the

418
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,360
fuel so you will invest more money into

419
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,039
the fuel and it will fly faster

420
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,319
you can build a spaceship with nuclear

421
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,880
engine

422
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,359
ross cosmos and ross adam are building

423
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,559
something like that and it's going to be

424
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,599
built by 2030 and it's not a simple

425
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,880
thing

426
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,079
nuclear reactor will produce electricity

427
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,160
and this electricity will be delivered

428
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,520
to the ion agent ion engines are used

429
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,039
for satellites very convenient

430
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,280
they can work continuously

431
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,160
they spend their fuel very slowly but

432
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,200
they are very weak

433
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,600
small jet and big ship cannot be moved

434
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,600
by this small jet but if you have a

435
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,120
nuclear engine

436
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,520
you have a lot of energy and you can

437
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,240
install a lot of your own engines ion

438
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,600
engines and then it's going to fla fly

439
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,840
fast but it's very complicated it's very

440
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,919
uh heavy construction yeah it's going to

441
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,440
be heavy

442
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,000
it will take like two attempts uh to

443
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,160
bring it into the outer space in pieces

444
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,440
and then it's gonna be assembled in the

445
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,760
outer space but it can reach

446
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,840
the moon maybe a little slower than a

447
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,360
regular look at

448
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,799
venus they will fly together then they

449
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,039
turn around venus but speaking about

450
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,760
jupiter it will fly several months

451
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,480
earlier than uh chemical engine what

452
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,960
does it mean faster it means that we can

453
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,640
send human out there and for example

454
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,919
i'll tell you a couple of words and i

455
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,000
will tell you why next to the venus

456
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,799
next to the jupiter and saturn there are

457
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,240
satellites

458
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,240
with a lot of water and maybe there's

459
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,240
life and we have to search for it that's

460
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,320
what we're saying well if there's a life

461
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,480
there's a simple life a very simple life

462
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,840
not humans

463
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,960
humans cannot live in such conditions

464
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,600
and there are some fantastic projects

465
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,919
but maybe it's going to work out miller

466
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,320
have proposed to

467
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,430
have a small uh

468
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,919
[Music]

469
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,160
device

470
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,559
to next to speed

471
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,520
space it flies to the neighboring star

472
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,360
like proxima centaurus and sends

473
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,280
pictures what happens on their plans do

474
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,160
they have life or not

475
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,799
at least one picture in 30 years

476
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,160
but no breaking no energy spent on this

477
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,440
it works and flies away

478
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,840
but well we are on the threshold of

479
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,360
learning something new there are some

480
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,799
other fantastic themes there are

481
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,400
physical events like

482
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,000
like the wormhole can you tell me about

483
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,360
the wormhole well it's called the

484
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,200
wormhole because

485
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,600
it's in a space it's a hole in it you

486
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,760
put your hand inside of it but it gets

487
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,880
out in other galaxy

488
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,600
material you've been looking a lot of uh

489
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,480
sci-fi movies

490
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,760
it's the crazy hat owner yeah the alice

491
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,640
have dropped it was the wormhole she was

492
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,320
in the next universe

493
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,679
you think why everybody was so strange

494
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,480
we don't know whether they exist of this

495
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,960
size we don't know whether it's possible

496
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,280
to move into the neighboring galaxy to

497
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,799
this wormhole but according to

498
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,520
calculations it's not prohibited by the

499
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,240
laws of physics and our engines did you

500
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,000
watch star trek

501
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,799
they created the warp and they boom and

502
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,520
they've being sucked somewhere

503
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,320
well right now the theory of relativity

504
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,320
does not allow engines to fly faster

505
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,080
than the speed of light

506
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,640
and maybe the space can be moved and

507
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,919
this is still a fantastic uh thing

508
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,039
sci-fi

509
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,360
but nobody prohibits humans to acquire

510
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,520
new knowledge and try to move faster

511
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,640
is it time

512
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,280
yes we have one minute left

513
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,200
unfortunately

514
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,039
you can ask your question

515
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,280
or i will tell you about the search of

516
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,000
life tell me about this life search is

517
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,320
there life is there life

518
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,159
studying of the universe is so beautiful

519
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,840
but it's so important to understand

520
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,000
whether there is life on other planets

521
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,840
or it's only on the earth and second of

522
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,320
all is there are is there a cognitive

523
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,559
life

524
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,679
like simple life or maybe

525
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,240
simple life with brains no it doesn't

526
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,159
have like that

527
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,640
the brain is a multicellular object well

528
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,480
we're looking for it on the mars and

529
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,480
it's to seldom that exomars was

530
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,080
prohibited we've been doing it together

531
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,600
with europeans nobody wants to be our

532
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,760
friends europeans told us that we're not

533
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,000
going to fly they're idiots well they

534
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,679
could give us the device and we could

535
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,840
launch it because they are searching for

536
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,960
life on mars and they cannot find it but

537
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,960
there is no atmosphere on the mars it's

538
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,080
very

539
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,480
diluted atmosphere so

540
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,960
the solar radiation

541
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,120
decomposes everything in the surface so

542
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,480
we have to dig and exomass was prepared

543
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,640
so we fly there we put the landing

544
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,240
module then a mass carrier drills two

545
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,919
meters deep hole in order to understand

546
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,840
on the depth uh maybe there are some

547
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,480
bacteria on two meters depth

548
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,640
also there could be a life

549
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,400
on europa

550
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,440
callisto europa is a satellite

551
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,600
don't get afraid not not this europe

552
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,799
well there could be life in europe

553
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,559
you'll put me into the extremists well

554
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:39,000
europe is a satellite of jupiter

555
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,200
there is more water in this satellite

556
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,520
more than on the earth but it's the size

557
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,559
of moon and it's interesting well

558
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,559
is there no life in this ocean it's

559
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,799
liquid because jupiter pulls it pushes

560
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,440
pools pushes pulls and pushes

561
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,080
and this liquid is liquid uh maybe there

562
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,440
are some simple

563
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,080
uh bodies so nasa have launched two

564
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,760
missions

565
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,640
already first it was i see moon juicy it

566
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,600
was called and then

567
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,320
yet 2024 europe clipper and they will

568
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,600
analyze these explosions and fountains

569
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,919
from under the ice is there any life

570
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,159
there or not

571
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,480
so is there or not

572
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,880
the science doesn't know it yet

573
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,120
and this is why we have to fly there

574
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,760
and smart life is searched on the

575
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,000
exoplanets together with telescopes

576
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,360
we're looking at them we're

577
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,600
investigating them maybe they will blink

578
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,080
a certain lamp they're not linking to us

579
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,679
then we apply

580
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,200
spectrometry

581
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,760
spectrometric studies so well if the

582
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,600
planet has an oxygen

583
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,000
oxygen hydrogen that's understandable in

584
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,279
water

585
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,240
but methane is a biomarker and it's been

586
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,720
created on the planets where the life is

587
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,000
so if we will see something like that

588
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,600
then it's gonna be much more interesting

589
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,760
for us to investigate the outer space

590
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,760
and second of all we are getting in

591
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,760
touch with the outer space and send

592
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,679
radio signal but then we will know

593
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,120
should we send somebody to that

594
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,120
particular planet because maybe they

595
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,039
have smart life

596
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,360
sasha i do hope

597
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,679
that someday we're going to fly to the

598
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,080
moon to the mars and

599
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,880
somewhere else to some exoplanet it was

600
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,480
wonderful

601
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,480
so i also hope that our broadcasting

602
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,240
is being watched

603
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,000
by vladimir nazarov and by the next year

604
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,799
or maybe in two years we are going to

605
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:37,760
have

606
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,279
space stations in our state it's going

607
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,640
to be interesting

608
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,200
to see what can be done with it

609
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,600
and you have to communicate well i would

610
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,600
write something about it and today we've

611
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,720
been visited by alexander baule main

612
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,320
chief and editor about the space
