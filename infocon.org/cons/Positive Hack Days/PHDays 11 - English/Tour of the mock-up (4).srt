it was a good day

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,440
and it was rich day honestly speaking

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,120
in the course of two days you know teams

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,600
were getting their power and the second

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,840
day they finally get to our machines and

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,160
they started solving our tasks they have

16
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,360
not been sleeping last night and

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,600
yesterday

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,480
10 58 they already have realized

19
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,519
dehydrator this bowl

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,160
it was red yesterday will you show us

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,320
this today because we were not able to

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,559
see it yesterday well if they will show

23
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,640
it once again okay this is kada and this

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,680
is ball

25
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,438
it shouldn't work like this in normal

26
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,000
mode it shouldn't be filled with water

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,400
scada shouldn't be so bright red and

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,000
tubes should not burn with red color

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,360
why

30
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,439
because

31
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,680
just a couple of minutes before this

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,119
broadcast

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,520
could buy have realized this risk and by

34
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,200

37
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,720
they've repeated

38
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,960
the same way or they did it their own

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,400
way

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,200

145
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,720
extinguishing

146
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,639
does it look like there is a real fire

147
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,960
inside oh yeah the smoke was beautiful

148
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,199
in beginning it was so dark and it had a

149
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,639
nice smell

150
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,240
like cherries no it's better not to

151
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,680
smell it

152
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,000
you've prohibited me to stick my fingers

153
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,160
inside of it but honestly speaking what

154
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,680
has happened you see

155
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,600
these tubes around it

156
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,840
okay it was switched off

157
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,240
but in these tubes they deliver oil at

158
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,199
the bottom they have certain uh

159
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,960
yes jet

160
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,160
jets and if you will switch gas a supply

161
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,400
on a full size and oil transportation

162
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,520
will be stopped the

163
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,319
tubes will blow

164
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,280
and the overheated oil will start

165
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,080
burning on this open fire and everything

166
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,440
will be coming

167
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,160
in a big fireball

168
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,080
big black steam and foam and

169
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,400
everything's gonna burn

170
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,160
but in real life is it

171
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,039
possible to extinguish such a fire

172
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,080
well yesterday i've been speaking about

173
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,919
this thing and there's a big tank

174
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,560
everything is burning

175
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,319
big fire and these foam extinguishing

176
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,880
system can stop this fire in 20 seconds

177
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,560
so in here it's also going to be done in

178
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,400
20 seconds not here it's much worse it's

179
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,680
going to be much worse that's what i'm

180
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,720
speaking about

181
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,400
so if this will start burning that's

182
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,919
going to be the end

183
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,080
not the end not the end okay the next

184
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,160
element in our oil

185
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,800
refinery the final one

186
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,280
it's the rectification column so here's

187
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,039
the scatter for this rectifier and

188
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,599
here's the rectification column

189
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,039
yeah we're going to switch to it okay

190
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,560
this is a rectification column

191
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,280
is divided into different fractions and

192
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,599
depending on temperature rectification

193
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,400
of oil is happening it comes overheated

194
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,080
from the bottom and then it's being

195
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,919
separated at different fractions at

196
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,680
different heights

197
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,599
and they collect different fractions on

198
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,360
different heights and they are delivered

199
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,919
to different tanks those fractions of

200
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,719
finished products

201
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,520
so right now one two three

202
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,240
they will show an accident so what do we

203
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,240
see right now yeah we see

204
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,639
it's the column is over field if

205
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,240
overheated steam will come

206
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,039
to these and it's gonna be all filled

207
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,639
with the oil rectification is not

208
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,639
happening and that's it and from all the

209
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,840
tubes the wrong product is coming out

210
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,919
the technical technological process has

211
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,399
been destroyed and all refinery doesn't

212
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,479
work as it's supposed to have a question

213
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,958
related on or unrelated when yesterday

214
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,279
they have realized uh cross-industrial

215
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,959
risk here

216
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,160
there were words

217
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,040
i've heard the words rectificational

218
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,959
that's why i'm asking you but there were

219
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,399
two other cool worlds

220
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,360
saltless and waterless oil yeah that's

221
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,480
right that's right this inter industrial

222
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,240
uh connection because in this second

223
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,480
minima scheme there's a pump pipe

224
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,760
pump here

225
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,640
which produces aviation fuel and pumps

226
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,440
it through this pipeline to the airport

227
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,839
so this is our storage out there it's

228
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,560
the airport and if you will get into the

229
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,640
sky you can stop

230
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,240
oil pipeline with aviation kerosene it

231
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,640
says aviation kerosene for the

232
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,200
jet fuel yeah it is jet fuel

233
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,880
yeah it is jet fuel great

234
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,720
and how do you deliver this jet fuel

235
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,680
well rectifier does the rectification of

236
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,959
oil dividing it into fractions but uh

237
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,640
something that we've had in the middle

238
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,120
is the electric dehydrator this is

239
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,120
something that takes away water and

240
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,920
salts from the finished product okay

241
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,399
that's it

242
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,279
you cannot deliver a lot of

243
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,680
jet fuel through trucks

244
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,279
so you do it through the pipeline but

245
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,120
potlight was shut down yesterday the

246
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,959
only thing which is still operational

247
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,399
well i'm lying to you i'm lying to you

248
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,200
this morning this morning fuel station

249
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,360
was also released so finished uh oil

250
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,360
products are being sold in a fueling

251
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,519
station you see gas station and next to

252
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,920
this gas station there is a price tag

253
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,680
maybe you cannot see it but you see

254
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,519
advertising here

255
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,680
yeah i see the numbers

256
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,000
so yesterday through

257
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,640
have replaced it by zeros and we will

258
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,399
show this to you when it's going to

259
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,600
start okay now it's start blinking and

260
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,680
can you zoom it there will be zero zero

261
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,439
zero zero the price of the fuel

262
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,360
delivery

263
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,440
it's the price influence

264
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,880
yes but i've told you this is a

265
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,880
different story we have finished with

266
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,200
airplanes but with fueling station it's

267
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,120
already realizations of realization and

268
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,760
sales of oil products it's the sales of

269
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,240
the gasoline after it was produced and

270
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,640
processed transported and they're trying

271
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,079
to sell it

272
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,720
okay i understand the problem in price

273
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,360
changes the problem is not the delivery

274
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,200
have stopped but the prices have been

275
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,240
changed

276
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,880
yes it's the same story as when all

277
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,720
products are delivered for example one

278
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,800
year in may 21

279
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,959
there was a hacker attack against

280
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,839
colonial pipeline and they've stopped

281
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,320
delivery of uh

282
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,240
90 of their

283
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,760
gas stations they run out of gasoline

284
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,880
and people could not refuel their cars

285
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,680
and

286
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,000
gas prices went up that's why i thought

287
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,959
that

288
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,120
we have the same situation here

289
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,959
well this situation is about stoppage of

290
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,680
uh fuel delivery and these are attacks

291
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,000
against the fueling station and we see

292
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,079
that if things like that happen in

293
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,639
modern automated fueling station there's

294
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,120
a control system you can have

295
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,120
contactless payments uh cashless

296
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,440
payments uh you fuel your car and leave

297
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,519
so it means the east one cannot serve

298
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,279
the passengers and it's controlled by

299
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,200
the controller so if they will get

300
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,440
inside this controller and we do have

301
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,959
similar projects

302
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,320
they might cause service mode and will

303
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,880
demonstrate it

304
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,519
you will see

305
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,720
that

306
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,320
fueling station is not going to work

307
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,440
so do we see it no

308
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,519
not the sure solution yet

309
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,040
not yet

310
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,880
not yet

311
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,120
oh my god no

312
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,440
okay it blinks it blinks and right now

313
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,720
this telly you will see the fueling gun

314
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,000
being crossed over it means it's red and

315
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,639
these cars it shows like an accident

316
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,240
there's a queue out of cars and they

317
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,079
cannot review

318
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,079
beautiful

319
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,560
wonderful so people are queuing and they

320
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,560
cannot fuel their cars

321
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,200
okay julia i think we're finished with

322
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,360
oil products

323
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,680
i've shown you everything that i wanted

324
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,839
you with these three new cells okay

325
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,120
let's move in that direction that

326
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,040
direction yes i wanted to go into

327
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,959
another direction i wanted to rest in

328
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,000
the park

329
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,800
let's go to the park recreational park

330
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,880
okay this box you've been standing next

331
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,880
to

332
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,760
this system

333
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,920
which controls the parking here's the

334
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,920
entrance

335
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,880
to the parking lot in the entertainment

336
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,680
park and according to the legend

337
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,160
entrance is controlled by the system

338
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,560
which recognizes uh

339
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,480
driving license

340
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,920
our license

341
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,560
license plate

342
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,480
and you can see a lot of different

343
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,880
license plates system recognizes them

344
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,440
and then we have lists of who can get in

345
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,000
who cannot get in and sometimes you see

346
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,199
that the

347
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,000
gate is getting opened when he sees the

348
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,720
proper number the gate automatically

349
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,839
lets them in

350
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,440
point i don't remember close to the new

351
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,880
year there was a big story that in

352
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,639
moscow

353
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,279
the gate

354
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,399
has been

355
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,639
broken to vulnerabilities

356
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,639
so we have only the gates but will there

357
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,880
any car that will approach it or it will

358
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,760
open by itself

359
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,120
where's the car the cars are not riding

360
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,199
why they're not driving

361
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,160
because i think hackers broke everything

362
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,160
let's move up

363
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,279
to water cleaning

364
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,680
okay i wanted to see it but i didn't see

365
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,079
it okay let's go to the cleaning water

366
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,160
cleaning system i will stick my finger

367
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,480
inside or i shouldn't

368
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,880
shouldn't they

369
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,320
we will try to clean the space so we are

370
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,959
interested in this view this is cleaning

371
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,279
water cleaning system

372
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,120
and i'll give you the mouse and on this

373
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,959
computer

374
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,440
well this is a nice view here

375
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,920
let's move here

376
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,639
i did have a lot of people to organize

377
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,600
the beach with swimming people it's

378
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,920
beautiful are these cows or pigs

379
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,639
i think there's a hunter on the top

380
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,240
yeah

381
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,279
it's for the joy of visitors

382
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,399
julia what should i do

383
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,240
okay we have a cleaning system here

384
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,880
there's a mouse here's a stop button can

385
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,160
you press it i hope that i need to press

386
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,880
you will stop the water cleaning system

387
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,320
and everything will start blinking and

388
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,639
what is going to happen look

389
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:05,920
look

390
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,360
oh my god somebody have destroyed

391
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,120
the cleaning system the water is

392
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,440
poisoned the cleaning system is not

393
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,680
working that's it

394
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,279
so the nature has been poisoned and the

395
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,040
dirty water

396
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,320
was spilled into the river and this lady

397
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,040
running into the river she suffered from

398
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,040
hackers

399
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,079
she's dirty now little shear stolen

400
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,440
the next

401
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,079
what we have it's the metal mining

402
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,240
company metal company okay this is the

403
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,560
scada and this is a piece of the company

404
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,759
if you remember these workshops

405
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,199
last time they were closed

406
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,240
and this

407
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,399
bucket inside it's a converter you

408
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,480
remember it it was here but these two

409
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,440
shops

410
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,079
they were closed

411
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,000
so in here in the left side

412
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,519
we have continuous

413
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,359
melting machine

414
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,359
rolling machine continuously rolling and

415
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,559
the steel which comes from the converter

416
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,119
it's delivered here you see the steel

417
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,439
carrier approaches

418
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,480
and then it's been melted and then it's

419
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,240
been pulled and cut into slabs

420
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,199
which

421
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,160
are rolled afterwards do you know that

422
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,319
slabs are red hot

423
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,559
do you see that they're red light

424
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,480
do they look like real metal i never

425
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,039
seen the real metal but it looks like

426
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,440
yeah we've tried we had high frequency

427
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,039
system which

428
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,080
allows these things to be lit inside can

429
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,039
you park so close to the production uh

430
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,559
facilities

431
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,039
i tell you yes

432
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,120
and b in a normal situation there is a

433
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,640
wall and nothing is seen through the

434
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,760
wall

435
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,000
so we'll demonstrate what hackers should

436
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,880
do

437
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,240
in order to

438
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,919
hot metal is being melted here then it

439
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,760
goes to the cooling system it's been

440
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,480
cooled and it has a cork and it's been

441
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,799
pulled out for this cork by the pulling

442
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,880
mechanism

443
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,640
it looks like the candies are being

444
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,919
produced maybe maybe it's exactly like

445
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,679
the kanjis so if you will stop

446
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,600
operations or if you will change the

447
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,320
temperature instead of the cooler what

448
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,799
is going to happen that they still will

449
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,160
just drop in this place on the floor

450
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,000
because in crystallizer it's getting

451
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,440
cooler but if you

452
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,320
remove this one it's going to flow down

453
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,720
and right now you'll try to do

454
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,120
to make it flow forward we'll fix the

455
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,440
temperature in the freezer

456
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,480
let's show

457
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,200
these two people with continuous view

458
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,679
and right now we'll make accident

459
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,600
everything's okay right now so we're in

460
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,159
escada

461
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,200
you will

462
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,280
reduce it so where should i press yeah

463
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,720
press here

464
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,400
left button

465
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,840
yeah this one this one

466
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,280
drop temperature to 75

467
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:11,780
50

468
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,840
[Music]

469
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,240
25.

470
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,760
a little bit more

471
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,600
so the temperature is dropping dropping

472
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,320
down to zero

473
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,960
does

474
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,799
and the accident will happen right now

475
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,960
and everything will start floating to

476
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,600
the bottom because tasting what happens

477
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,280
right now

478
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,679
yeah it went down to the core of the

479
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,080
earth and right now this workshop they

480
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,720
have this melted metal on the floor does

481
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,200
it look like it yeah and it has a fire

482
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,280
like out there and nobody can

483
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,960
fix it and everybody will die

484
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,440
the viewers should stay alive

485
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,120
yeah they see this burnt place burned to

486
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,320
ashes with some demons

487
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,159
from hell

488
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,400
i hope these are not employees of the

489
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,320
factory

490
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,120
okay it's the end of this story

491
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,760
second workshop that has been open for

492
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,360
us

493
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,158
just recently

494
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,919
okay

495
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,600
is here

496
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,679
in the beginning in the beginning we can

497
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,760
change the angle for camera and you can

498
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,559
look it from here

499
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,120
the

500
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,919
beam is thicker but then it's been

501
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,440
rolled

502
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,159
it becomes thinner the next one

503
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,120
continues rolling it into even a thinner

504
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,960
rod and at the end we have a hot thin

505
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,320
rod which is being reeled

506
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,320
in the last bobbin

507
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,799
so the movements and the speeds of all

508
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,960
these uh and it's been controlled by the

509
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,200
special controller with a lot of sensors

510
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,240
that watch that rolling process

511
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,559
which looks easy

512
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,039
actually it has real sensors and when

513
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,520
something deviates from it

514
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,840
it's still being pulled so

515
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,679
it is being pulled there's a lot of

516
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,799
automation which holds it

517
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,880
where this process is so what are we

518
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,600
going to do okay right now

519
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,520
right now we have scott here we're going

520
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,600
to show two viewers

521
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,080
we have a lot of parameters with sensors

522
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,039
with thickness with the width of each

523
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,120
one of these

524
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,000
it's very beautiful but really unclear

525
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,240
every cell

526
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,640
what you we have three cells

527
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,960
and a lot of parameters so right now

528
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,280
we're going to reduce the thickness in

529
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,159
the

530
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,080
cage number three

531
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,919
so we will reduce the thickness of the

532
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:58,880
rod

533
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,720
so that in the final we are going to

534
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,280
have the thinner rod but at a certain

535
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,280
moment of time let's go there let's go

536
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,520
there can you see can you see it's very

537
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,080
bad in here and we're going to stop the

538
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,559
cage number three so it means that uh

539
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,159
the rod is going to be very thin

540
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,840
so i press it down to zero

541
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,600
okay the rod

542
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,600
rolling is going to stop

543
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,559
yeah it's stopped and what happened but

544
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,880
it's still pushing the rod

545
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,120
and it starts

546
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,000
pulling out this road outside it's been

547
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,480
pushed but it's not going to be pulled

548
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,760
and it rotates you see it's going oh my

549
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,559
god

550
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,240
oh my god

551
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,000
and it's going to be like that in real

552
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,679
life it's going to be like that

553
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:46,720
like

554
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,960
with the size of the building

555
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,760
well if you will look in youtube upon

556
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,440
the request

557
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,880
the beam uh sticking out

558
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,240
it's not hot

559
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,559
it's not real so it's not going to burn

560
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,559
your finger

561
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,840
it will break the roof

562
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,480
and this beam is going to be inside of

563
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,400
the workshop it's flying out because

564
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
it's been pressed and it's moving out

565
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,039
and you know

566
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,559
it will hit the roof it will break

567
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,240
everything it's awful it's going to be

568
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,280
awful oh my god fire roof everything's

569
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,678
breaking

570
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,280
so these are two new incident in metal

571
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,039
production and nobody were able to

572
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,000
realize them right

573
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,880
i think i don't hear that anybody have

574
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,120
hit metals from the attackers did you

575
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,840
hear that somebody is in metallica

576
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,919
two inadmissible events but i don't

577
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,159
remember which of those i think you will

578
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,120
show me everything here

579
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,200
they have not reached scada

580
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,039
i can tell you definitely they have not

581
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,039
reached scada yet

582
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,720
what next uh the

583
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,919
pipes are licking here no

584
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,880
beautiful flanges red lenses no this is

585
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,039
our gas station

586
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,640
yesterday

587
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,679
and they like our welder who welds and

588
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,640
then burns it's the same burning welder

589
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,000
it's been burning like phoenix

590
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,440
well this is a real replica this is a

591
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,600
replica okay what's next

592
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,520
we're going to move into this corner and

593
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,440
this is going to be the end of our

594
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,360
sightseeing tour and we're going to show

595
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,120
you the last thing that we have in our

596
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,000
replica of the city it's the electrical

597
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,640
generation these two cells it's the

598
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,320
generation

599
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,880
hydro power station nuclear power plant

600
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,080
and typical power plant

601
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,480
during the previous event okay can you

602
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,720
show me nuclear power plant i've never

603
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,120
seen them here it is it's not working

604
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,840
it's not operational it's getting ready

605
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,000
for the next year and by the we're going

606
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,840
to complete it but last time

607
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,080
hydro power plant didn't work and we

608
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,000
didn't have scada

609
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,320
but we are developing

610
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,480
next time uh nuclear power plant is

611
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,279
going to work this time uh hydropower

612
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,320
plant is operational and we did go to

613
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,200
real uh power plant we went to all the

614
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,240
shops we looked at all the automation

615
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,360
and the motifs of what is done in real

616
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,840
one we created scada from the with the

617
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,240
hydro controller with oil system with

618
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,679
pneumatics

619
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:26,559
and

620
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,400
the system of group uh control of hydro

621
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,960
uh machinery in a hydro plant and this

622
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,760
is uh the same controller like in real

623
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,039
uh scada of volga gas

624
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,039
it's a big hydroelectrical energy

625
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,840
company

626
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,520
this is a new one

627
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,679
you see at the bottom it has this uh

628
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:50,640
snail

629
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,720
and this is the cross section and that's

630
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,120
how it looks like but what can be broken

631
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,440
here you can disconnect water or what

632
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,039
well i've invented what should happen

633
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,679
here next time when nuclear power plant

634
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,480
will work

635
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,120
except for chemistry homer simpson

636
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,720
nothing comes to my mind

637
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,039
well if they will realize a risk yeah

638
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,760
and something explodes here they should

639
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,720
have double headed sheep flying out of

640
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,159
it

641
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,880
nuclear power plant

642
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,039
it has exploded but

643
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,799
there is something leaving and now this

644
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,760
living thing have two heads

645
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,679
yeah we will read what happened in

646
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,360
chernobyl we will learn about these

647
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,559
stories and then we'll make

648
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,640
double-headed whatever

649
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,440
let's start with hydropower plant let's

650
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,039
do something to it

651
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,120
so it will do something to the hydro

652
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,679
power plant we are going to have the

653
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,760
energy supply problems and there's not

654
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,080
going to be any light in the city

655
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,159
well

656
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,159
we have fixed logic previously we had

657
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,159
only one point of generation it was a

658
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,400
heat power plant right now we also have

659
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,200
a hydra so we have two power plants and

660
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,720
two substations so on the step by step

661
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,679
uh basis we are introducing backup in

662
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,919
order to disconnect the whole city you

663
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,960
have to disconnect everything yeah uh

664
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,360
hydro and heat

665
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,039
should be stopped well energy supply

666
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,120
company it's a commercial accounting of

667
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,159
the consumed energy they make agreements

668
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,120
they have the consumer devices sensors

669
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,559
are installed in cities and then

670
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,559
calculations with the users okay let's

671
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,760
make sure at the end

672
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,279
well you have asked me well this is a

673
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,120
lot of sensors here and it looks like

674
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,840
the previous time however

675
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,760
honestly speaking it's not like in the

676
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,320
last time

677
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,919
the fountain of water no there's not

678
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,559
gonna be it's a hydro power plant

679
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,399
the hydro power plant that we've had in

680
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,320
the beginning of standoffs i'll remember

681
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,799
there was water and even a fish

682
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,720
it's not that one

683
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,159
this one is much more modest

684
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,320
okay right now i have to disconnect

685
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,159
group controller

686
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,039
and then we are going to be able

687
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:11,039
to change sensors

688
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,639
what are you doing here

689
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,679
this is hydro energy things this is a

690
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,440
group regulation controller i've

691
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,080
disconnected it and scada and right now

692
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,440
we will have to change the settings and

693
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,080
well right now i don't remember what

694
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,120
else should i press yeah

695
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,640
well that's it i've disconnected

696
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,120
everything cereal here will can you give

697
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,799
me the demonstration how the nuclear

698
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,480
power plant is going to stop i mean

699
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,159
hydropower plant and you will see that

700
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,480
hydra

701
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,960
[Music]

702
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,120
turbine will stop

703
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,600
yeah this is a cross-section number one

704
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,919
and two by number two and we have a lot

705
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,960
of those turbines and they can also be

706
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,360
uh remotely disconnected okay

707
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,799
[Music]

708
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,960
about generation what have we done right

709
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,000
now we have stopped only one source of

710
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,440
generation

711
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,559
and a heat power plant still works so

712
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,159
our city still have light no blackout

713
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,720
but last year if they've been stopping

714
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,720
the heat power plant

715
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,679
the city was without the electricity

716
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,320
well according to the legend uh one line

717
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,799
should be disconnected to the factory

718
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,520
and factory can stay without light i'm

719
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,440
speaking about metal

720
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,720
producing

721
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,360
i'm not lying to you the hydro power

722
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,039
plant is not working but there is still

723
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,120
electricity there is still electricity

724
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,279
but i hoped that something will black

725
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,320
out i don't know some lamps will not be

726
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,240
as bright

727
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,399
electricity well most of the electricity

728
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,240
is produced by the hate power plant so

729
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,760
it's the biggest one if it works

730
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,360
everything's all right okay understand

731
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,320
it i understand it and hydro power plant

732
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,320
nobody cares about it it plays

733
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,240
regulation functions etc but i would

734
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,679
like to tell you that it's not

735
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,600
interesting to attack it as well nothing

736
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,799
will happen

737
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,559
but they're working for the points and

738
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,440
it's the question of the scale it's on

739
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,120
the level of the country it's very

740
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,200
noticeable well it's very bad for the

741
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,840
energy system

742
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,960
today

743
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,320
this morning

744
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,678
i had a super idea

745
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,559
yes

746
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,880
i would like to ask all of them about

747
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,480
expectations what's going to be broken

748
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,399
in the end of the day remaining four and

749
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,799
a half hours so you think what they are

750
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,480
going to break today

751
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,399
i believe that quarterback will break

752
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,320
the airport

753
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,080
and the guys who are sitting inside of

754
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,000
the energy and oil companies they will

755
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,360
complete breaking it how fast

756
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,200
well as we can see from the experience

757
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,120
in recent

758
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,600
hour uh tourists they will break through

759
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,120
and they will

760
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,039
just break it

761
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,120
i believe they will do it okay one half

762
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,880
hours one and a half hours vladimir

763
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,919
gives you 1.5 hours in order for you to

764
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,440
complete his

765
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,159
uh exercise it was very nice working

766
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,240
together with you around the streets of

767
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,399
our replica state

768
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,080
we have not reached the

769
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,960
city we've been walking

770
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,960
next to the industrial facilities yeah

771
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,080
we've been visiting industrial

772
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,399
facilities but well well it was not that

773
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:20,080
bad and we were not in traffic jam
