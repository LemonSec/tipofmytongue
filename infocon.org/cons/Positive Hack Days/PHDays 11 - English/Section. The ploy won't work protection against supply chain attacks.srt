1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
oh that's it good

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,120
well

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,640
well

4
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,640
at the plenary meeting we were talking

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,800
about tectonic shifts

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,679
and

7
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,040
the shifts

8
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,240
take place even in our section one of

9
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,039
the speakers is missing the

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:17,920
and

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,960
thanks to sasha bondarienko who joined

12
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,720
our section

13
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,600
so

14
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,240
we have more or less

15
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,760
a section

16
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,560
so

17
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,720
protection of supply chain

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,360
wouldn't work

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,040
any company

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,920
when it uses external content works with

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,920
external suppliers vendors

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,680
uses external

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,440
libraries and becomes dependent on them

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,160
and in the recent months from

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,399
february 24 we had a number of attacks

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,960
related to this factor and we would like

27
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,479
to discuss it now we have a

28
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,080
disparate

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,760
team i am

30
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,880
from solo my colleagues pavel kulikov is

31
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,479
from s-deck

32
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,600
alexander bondarienko from eurovision

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,040
and rahman malitzen from astral linux

34
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,159
so

35
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,600
a good team actually

36
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,360
suppliers vendors

37
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,759
supplier

38
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,360
so we would like to

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,320
answer many questions the question is

40
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,400
also diverse

41
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,200
we had different kinds of attacks and i

42
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,600
will address part of the questions to

43
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,840
specific questions

44
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,439
for their area of competence but please

45
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,840
interrupt us squirrel

46
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,240
uh

47
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,759
each of us have

48
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,799
his own opinion so let's start from

49
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,399
far away

50
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,640
not about the supply chain

51
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,840
i recall the latest incidents

52
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,040
about

53
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,200
building content at web resources

54
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,160
after the plenary i talked to the

55
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,959
journalists who became victims of

56
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,480
attacks

57
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,840
usually they talk about attacks but

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,080
at the beginning of our special

59
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,800
operation at many

60
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,879
media we had high

61
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,120
headlines

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,319
with inappropriate content

63
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,720
then the same attack

64
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,319
was directed

65
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,238
at government agencies

66
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,720
[Music]

67
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,840
and

68
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,760
globally turned into

69
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,680
harsh

70
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,560
recommendations from different

71
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,160
regulators

72
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,000
including the ministry of digital

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,680
development

74
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,560
in your website please don't use

75
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,840
external content because if the site is

76
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,400
broken you will have problems

77
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,519
so

78
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,200
what about reaction

79
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,840
to such incidents in your companies if

80
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,280
any

81
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,519
for example you have a large portal a

82
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,159
large resource you are interested in

83
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,440
external counters external

84
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,000
services how did you react to this

85
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,799
situation

86
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,840
so external

87
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,120
content yes

88
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,680
good good afternoon can you hear me yes

89
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,958
russia

90
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,519
yes

91
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,440
we saw such attacks

92
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,040
uh external counters external services

93
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,799
that we

94
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,879
installed in our

95
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,959
site

96
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,480
we had two things first counters

97
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,840
in an unauthorized zone without access

98
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,480
to our internal logic

99
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,519
external services and internal

100
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,599
the things that we developed ourselves

101
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,320
we developed our products on our own

102
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,440
historically without external support

103
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,000
express courier version 3

104
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,040
all internal logic is ours

105
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,160
and we have our internal counters as

106
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,120
well

107
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,759
in accordance with our internal

108
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,360
mattresses

109
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,840
so we didn't let anyone

110
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,080
inside but that was the initial design

111
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,080
what about indexing

112
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,680
yandex counters google counters metrics

113
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,160
that help the site

114
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,680
to go digital so you didn't have them

115
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,840
initially we had them

116
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,199
but in

117
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,080
certain zones public

118
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,880
zones which are not related to our

119
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,840
internal

120
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,560
kitchen

121
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,000
the

122
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,600
interface

123
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,320
external interface uses

124
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,360
google

125
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,000
yandex now we

126
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
reject google but yandex is used and

127
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
with the help of yandex

128
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,680
we build our

129
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,479
heat maps

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,320
alexander it's your turn

131
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,880
you are from our vision

132
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,320
uh so security of our vision is your job

133
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,840
as well

134
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,960
what is the situation for you

135
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,680
how did you react to such threats

136
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,280
it's very difficult to call it

137
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,960
irrelevant

138
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,840
as for the site in our case

139
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,039
it's not it wasn't critical

140
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:07,840
uh

141
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,720
i

142
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,080
don't remember any external products

143
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,840
there

144
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,800
it's a

145
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,840
purely informational resource

146
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,639
which is uh separated from our internal

147
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,800
enterprise infrastructure

148
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,880
of course if anything

149
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,720
could happen

150
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,880
it wouldn't compromise our internal

151
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,400
systems in any way

152
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,360
it's not exactly about supply chain but

153
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,360
from the very beginning of our operation

154
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,800
customers started getting phishing

155
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,800
information

156
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,209
[Music]

157
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,720
with ukraine send us a login and

158
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,520
password the rest will do ourselves

159
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,479
just send us

160
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,479
access codes that's all yes we got such

161
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,880
letters it's not about supply chain it's

162
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,120
about the attacks about the general

163
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,840
atmosphere

164
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,000
we could

165
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,840
disregard such actions

166
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,000
because they are not

167
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,440
feasible because it can break the image

168
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,719
and so on now everything can be possible

169
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,599
yes no logic there is only politics

170
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,960
they desire

171
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,919
to do something bad and people are ready

172
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,560
to do anything

173
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,400
now about supply chain

174
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,000
because uh such as

175
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,840
we have a big

176
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,080
wave

177
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,000
of something which wasn't possible

178
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
before

179
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,680
people may say i do not allow certain

180
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,720
countries to use my code although it's

181
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,039
open source

182
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,080
some

183
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,960
just

184
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,840
insert certain elements in the code

185
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,720
which

186
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,599
can

187
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,000
clean data or

188
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,280
pop up

189
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,919
banners in favor of a certain country

190
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,200
we have a lot of such things now

191
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,560
and the logic that we used before cannot

192
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,480
be used now

193
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,080
of course for us

194
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,959
it's

195
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,720
critical

196
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,279
to protect our internal resources but

197
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,519
talking about supply chain first of all

198
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,279
it's a question of

199
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,600
uh

200
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,720
mistrust

201
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,720
foreign

202
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,040
if that company can be hacked it's

203
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,720
impossible because it's a huge company

204
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,440
and it's very difficult to hack

205
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,320
now

206
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,480
that company itself can hack

207
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,720
the element in the supply chain

208
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,120
is not trusted

209
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,839
sometimes

210
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,399
malicious send we had to insert

211
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,360
additional control

212
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,279
elements control layers control tiers

213
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,880
to eliminate

214
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,600
malicious codes in our

215
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,480
infrastructure

216
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,120
the world still continues to be

217
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,600
integrated we use some open source

218
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,240
components and we wouldn't

219
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,440
like to be absolutely

220
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,330
[Music]

221
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,800
with anybody else but we need more

222
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,279
control

223
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,440
and elements at our relations in a

224
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,160
different way

225
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,720
open source

226
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,040
is close to our subject

227
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,880
i think

228
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,839
you also have such

229
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,920
cases roman

230
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,640
astral linux

231
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,480
uses community

232
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,760
codes

233
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,200
what is your reaction to this situation

234
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,160
what about your operating system yes i

235
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,800
can only agree that

236
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,160
this is our problem

237
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,720
the problem of supply chain protection

238
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,959
is very important for us

239
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,640
because

240
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,760
we use a lot of open source codes in our

241
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,560
operating system we try to use the

242
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,000
protected operating system which can be

243
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,959
installed in government agencies and

244
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,480
the

245
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,720
those agencies are

246
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,680
attack targets lucrative targets

247
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,959
and we cannot just control everything

248
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:29,920
and say

249
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,440
it's all right you can use it

250
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,200
indefinitely no

251
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,560
it's a multi-layered

252
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,040
issue

253
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,519
we have technological

254
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,839
control code control tools

255
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:48,959
and

256
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,600
when we certify for the first level of

257
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,480
trust we use all the modern phase

all the modern advanced

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,079
code control tools are used

262
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,839
in our company

263
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,440
and we try

264
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,959
to

265
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,839
use something new

266
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,920
the statistical analysis of the code

267
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,839
this is first layer

268
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,200
we have the trust stand trust base

269
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,880
we

270
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,920
check codes we ask

271
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,920
third parties to check our codes as well

272
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,320
especially for the critical elements

273
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,639
second is the

274
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,320
integrity control

275
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,720
tools

276
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,360
in the operating system which help us to

277
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,560
control

278
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,360
uh integrity of the code and the

279
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,959
replacement of

280
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,720
applications with malicious codes

281
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,480
during the

282
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,880
functioning during the operation of our

283
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,519
software so we have different integrity

284
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,720
control tools dynamic integrity control

285
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,320
all our software

286
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,880
in binary codes

287
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,320
is isolated from external world and is

288
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,839
assigned with electronic

289
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,560
signature and the module when the

290
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,720
software is launched

291
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,279
checks the correction of the electronic

292
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,639
picture to avoid replacement

293
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,480
and all the software

294
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,760
file based binary based is signed with

295
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,519
electronic signature

296
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,240
and our partners who develop software

297
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,160
is also

298
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,319
also receive our key pairs

299
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,199
with our

300
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,839
key management infrastructure and they

301
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:54,800
sign

302
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,199
their products

303
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,639
and we build

304
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,199
an enclosed

305
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,920
development environment but we

306
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,479
understand that in some situations

307
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,959
as you said at the beginning of the

308
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,160
discussion

309
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,959
that

310
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,839
some changes might take place in a

311
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,120
certain

312
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,000
piece of the code at some website that

313
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,560
we can miss so we have one more

314
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,600
subsystem of the integrity control

315
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,279
mandatory control

316
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,639
which divides all the software into

317
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,600
several layers of integrity

318
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,480
levels of trust as we call them

319
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,360
they are absolutely isolated one from

320
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,920
the other we have the system component

321
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,839
which is key the kernel

322
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,040
the initialization system for the web

323
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,439
server

324
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,920
and even if some malicious software

325
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,959
will reach the web server it cannot

326
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,079
affect

327
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:00,880
the

328
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,560
system software because those tiers are

329
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,199
divided

330
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,680
and independent of each other

331
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,519
we moved on

332
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,800
and developed the sandbox

333
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,399
mechanism for our software

334
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,959
we made it possible to use knocker

335
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,120
containers at some

336
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,120
integrity levels

337
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,920
system administrators can launch

338
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,519
software in some isolated

339
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,279
layers if they

340
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,959
doubt

341
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,120
if they cannot

342
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,079
trust

343
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,279
certain

344
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,440
codes to check in its integrity why do i

345
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,120
say that because uh

346
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,320
um

347
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,000
trust in

348
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,519
supply chain is very important and

349
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,720
one

350
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,160
one time checking is not sufficient it

351
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,399
should be multi-layered should be

352
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,920
multifaceted

353
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,680
signatures

354
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,480
division of binary layers

355
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,600
into

356
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,959
layers of trust

357
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,680
and many other mechanisms

358
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,519
for example building trusted

359
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,720
development

360
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,519
environment with partners thank you can

361
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,880
you comment

362
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,040
what

363
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,360
as i said before

364
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,560
we have

365
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,360
our own local product that we have been

366
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,079
developing historically on our own we

367
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,440
didn't have any external developers

368
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,839
we did the job ourselves

369
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,880
we used some outsourced components yes

370
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,240
we used them

371
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,759
and

372
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,160
there is an important point here

373
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,120
that

374
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,519
after

375
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,079
renewal of the repository of the package

376
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,519
will launch

377
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,119
a certain script to check all kind of

378
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,760
new trigger words and so on

379
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,760
so we have to check and monitor

380
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,079
we have to write the scripts

381
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,640
to check the script

382
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,199
texts

383
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,839
as for

384
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,760
the

385
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,360
automated and non-automated checks yes

386
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,919
they are also important

387
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:34,799
i

388
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,000
can say

389
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,760
that for

390
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,640
developers

391
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,039
we have the golden ear

392
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,919
when you can come and say that i need

393
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:48,799
this

394
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,840
because

395
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,679
this can

396
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,039
stop

397
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,480
uh eliminate reputation risks for the

398
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,039
company because if you don't do that you

399
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,559
can

400
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,559
lose reputation

401
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,120
in order to avoid this you you need one

402
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,760
two three four if you cannot buy it you

403
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,760
go to services to developers

404
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,440
[Music]

405
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,280
we changed the focus very much

406
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,320
in favor of security we had it before

407
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,080
but now it's

408
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,720
much greater

409
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:30,559
now

410
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,280
we have additional responsibility for

411
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,320
everything that is released

412
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,200
if you take for example

413
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,919
other developers

414
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,600
there were some potential

415
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,000
probable vulnerabilities but

416
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,240
nevertheless let us

417
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,559
release the product and then later on we

418
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,360
shall close the gaps now

419
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,840
the technical debt is not

420
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,960
relevant at all business wants

421
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,760
to avoid

422
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,120
compromises uh

423
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,520
loss of reputation at all so it's an

424
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,280
interesting time

425
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,400
for us

426
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,840
as for languages

427
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,080
and technologies

428
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,799
i think

429
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,919
russian engineers

430
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,320
have 100

431
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,640
probability of building their own

432
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,640
programming language

433
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,320
that would be nice

434
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,799
and secure

435
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,679
but this is just an opportunity for our

436
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,960
russian developers

437
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,559
if i got you right

438
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,240
so application security

439
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,799
[Music]

440
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:05,280
that was actively discussed by

441
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,919
security people now is

442
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,760
in the trend

443
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,240
and it's becoming a business function

444
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,320
actually almost

445
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,919
yes look

446
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,880
i would divide

447
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,919
it into two parts part one is

448
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,320
something that was needed really

449
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,520
and secondly

450
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,600
it's all the

451
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,880
marketing materials that

452
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,559
created the

453
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,200
requirement that

454
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,360
stimulated the requirement because there

455
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,840
were some

456
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,880
partners said you need sdlc why because

457
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,960
you have this and that we see such a

458
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,240
trend it goes from here into that

459
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,919
area and often that was also important

460
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,200
and decision makers

461
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,520
also

462
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,799
uh agreed without go into detail if they

463
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,280
say then this is

464
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,480
the it makes sense it's the worldwide

465
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,720
trend let us spend some money on that

466
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,480
resource now

467
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,360
the requirement is much higher

468
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,480
and

469
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,039
we can do it par we can make it part of

470
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,880
the business function

471
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,799
but as i believe the situation is that

472
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,919
security data security of the final

473
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,280
product

474
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,520
is really

475
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,880
a competitive edge

476
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,520
yes i got you good

477
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,240
you know i have an idea to continue with

478
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,520
the open source

479
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,880
uh

480
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,360
theme talk about upper calypses over the

481
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,520
past few years the world has been

482
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,679
surprising us all the time uh pavel and

483
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,960
i discussed that see the new reality has

484
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,440
arrived i got

485
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,240
inserted in it i got used to it and then

486
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,240
just tomorrow something turns around

487
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,440
again and i'm surprised again so we have

488
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,640
just been talking about each company

489
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,559
using open source one way or the other

490
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,559
and trying to control to keep under

491
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,400
control uh what's supplied from open

492
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,760
source

493
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,919
another day has arrived that open source

494
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,080
is supplying what we don't need

495
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,880
open source libraries

496
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,760
by default when russian facilities

497
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,440
start generating something inadmissible

498
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,799
for our companies for our customers

499
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,840
do you have any crisis plan in your

500
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,039
company what do you propose to do

501
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,559
well in

502
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,520
a random order who has anything to say

503
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,320
alexander maybe you can start

504
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,480
well if we take a look at what open

505
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,440
source is it's open source code in the

506
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,640
first place

507
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,760
and in this sense i believe that

508
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,080
regardless of all

509
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,440
these

510
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,799
things that have

511
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,480
happened recently so that projects

512
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,880
are being uh are seeing inbuilt

513
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,360
unfriendly scripts uh something else but

514
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,000
nevertheless this code is open

515
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,919
and stories like that happened before

516
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,880
maybe not at that scale but more

517
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,600
in a more utilitarian way

518
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,679
so now the logic is mostly about

519
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,840
political activism but in the past i

520
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,799
myself saw news that some open source

521
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,240
project

522
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,039
got a thing built in that would mine

523
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,559
cryptocurrency

524
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,559
or organize the ddos attacks or

525
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,480
something like that that used to exist

526
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,559
in the past as well

527
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,480
but with a different purpose and to a

528
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,240
smaller scale

529
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,400
and it was

530
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,200
just normal to see some project that was

531
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,039
still being maintained that would

532
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,120
be intercepted by the people who would

533
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,480
start

534
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,960
building some bad things in it but then

535
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,960
open source is about

536
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,120
having the source code open and it's the

537
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,880
trend and

538
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,200
i'm not really prepared

539
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,039
to

540
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,799
articulate that but it's a question of

541
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,080
trust

542
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,760
and i think people are looking at that

543
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,120
in the world as well

544
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,600
i think that the companies that are

545
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,640
going

546
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,400
to show this openness when they're

547
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,320
prepared to show this

548
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,840
source code

549
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,279
how many cases we can

550
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,360
remember that

551
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,600
foreign vendor uh would not

552
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,480
uh pass the source code to fsb for

553
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,760
certification

554
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,919
i think in the future the very content

555
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,039
of the code

556
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:45,600
will not be as valuable because

557
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,840
the vendor company

558
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,120
only has value if it's able

559
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:51,919
to

560
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:52,880
deliver

561
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,919
software

562
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,320
features and services and not because

563
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,799
their programmers have managed to

564
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,039
you know code some feature

565
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,679
so therefore the companies that will be

566
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:04,640
uh

567
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,080
ready uh to have the source code open

568
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,480
uh they will enjoy a better trust from

569
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,120
customers even though open source

570
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,919
has got smeared a bit now but it can be

571
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:16,960
controlled

572
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,760
i can open the code

573
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,120
i can

574
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,600
run some automatic tests so even

575
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,360
visually you can see what's happening

576
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,159
this code and then i can maintain it

577
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,240
myself but that depends on the license

578
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,600
of course because that would be a fork

579
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,959
if it's a close code

580
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,720
binaries are not arriving it becomes

581
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,640
much more difficult to analyze it

582
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,559
regarding the supply chain and the

583
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,159
source code

584
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,000
i recall the situation i think it

585
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,640
happened like five years ago and it was

586
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,799
about the following an employee in a

587
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,039
company has written an open source

588
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,120
library

589
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,400
so

590
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,480
attached to license to it i think it was

591
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,600
uh gpl3 and the remark was quite funny

592
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,559
there that uh

593
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,000
is open source but if this library

594
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,200
is going to be used in a piece of

595
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,559
software for distribution in the us

596
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,279
the author of this library

597
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,640
should receive

598
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,960
uh one and a half or two percent of the

599
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,960
company revenue

600
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,480
and here

601
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,600
there's a question of uh licensing

602
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,559
uh

603
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,679
cleanness so it's not enough to run

604
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,919
through the source code

605
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,320
you can also be caught on some a

606
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,159
licensing

607
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,000
condition

608
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,400
this calls back

609
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,559
the statement that there are projects

610
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,440
that says uh it can't be used in the

611
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,440
russian federation that's this first

612
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,320
case

613
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,320
and the second case is regarding what

614
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,840
you vladimir

615
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,879
is saying are saying

616
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,559
so

617
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,960
everybody has ever worked with mpm pack

618
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,080
packets

619
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,720
uh know that it looks like open source

620
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,120
it seems like uh clear

621
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:13,919
uh

622
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,320
there's a line there and you invoke it

623
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,080
certain actions happen and there are no

624
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,640
cases where miners for instance using

625
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,559
the package package

626
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,919
would

627
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,559
download some network sniffers as well

628
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,080
so this also has to be looked at so it's

629
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,080
also open source but the question is

630
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,480
where it connects and how much you can

631
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,919
trust it

632
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,840
and finally because

633
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,799
uh we're a country that is present

634
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,279
all over the world

635
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,440
no

636
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,760
nobody stands in the way for a

637
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,440
manufacturer to release uh some space in

638
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,520
the russian data center and make it so

639
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,360
that this particular library

640
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,760
this particular package

641
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,880
should

642
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,919
call

643
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:00,640
the

644
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,600
same data center that serves services

645
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,559
the infrastructure of the company itself

646
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,159
and then

647
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,960
it's about joint efforts from the

648
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,399
developers

649
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,720
and

650
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,640
network activity and forensic studies

651
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,000
so once again

652
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,039
we are forced from one place

653
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,640
to grow

654
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,320
information security of everything

655
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,640
i think

656
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,919
your story

657
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,799
is the most acute i'm sure uh you've

658
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,120
assessed those risks yes of course so

659
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,840
we've set these risks but i'd like uh to

660
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,080
mention separately that even though this

661
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,320
story was happening so malicious

662
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,799
software

663
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,880
was inserted into the open source

664
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,960
component but

665
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,200
as it was rightly

666
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,039
mentioned it was

667
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,440
a blow to the reputation of the open

668
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,039
source movement and the open source

669
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:07,279
movement felt this blow and understood

670
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,799
it's important because if they

671
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,600
were to allow this to happen looking

672
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,679
forward uh the whole reputation of the

673
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,399
open source movement uh would uh be

674
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,240
damaged so if you take a look at the

675
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,480
statements of the open source community

676
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,039
uh it's uh acutely negative

677
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,039
they try

678
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,480
to go away from political

679
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,240
mottos

680
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,159
slogans and

681
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,880
focus on the code

682
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,559
on the other hand

683
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,679
a question was asked how prepared are we

684
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,559
i would say uh we are uh perhaps uh

685
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,080
prepared a little bit more than other

686
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,640
developers of the operating systems

687
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,279
because historically we in astra linus

688
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,320
astra

689
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,880
uh wrote quite a lot of codes from

690
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,919
scratch

691
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,520
so the entire

692
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,960
set of information protection tools

693
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,360
the graphical environments

694
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,279
administrator utilities have been

695
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,039
written from

696
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,960
the ground up so we have built an

697
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,600
infrastructure of our own development we

698
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,440
are perhaps one of the few

699
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,720
uh who do

700
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,520
the operating system ux

701
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,399
we

702
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,399
have a lot of mobile apps uh with ux's

703
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,640
who do websites and mobile apps but

704
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,559
those who do the ux for operating

705
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,520
systems of the absolutely inexistent in

706
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,000
this country but we do that

707
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,919
it's clear that

708
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,240
not all the code has been written by

709
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,240
ourselves most of the code has been

710
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,080
borrowed from open source

711
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,279
but this said we understand how to

712
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:44,960
maintain the development of our own

713
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,799
operating systems

714
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:47,840
and

715
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,120
we believe that these risks are there

716
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,279
they're not yet important enough but

717
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,480
we'll try to build up the

718
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,720
head count of our own developers in

719
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,919
these conditions

720
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,799
okay clear but if the risks does come

721
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,559
so uh i've heard that we are going to

722
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,640
keep developing ourselves but then

723
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,279
it's a huge size skills scope

724
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,399
well it's about a considerable slowing

725
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,200
down of the development pace

726
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,919
if we accept this risk as

727
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,640
possible a feasible complete mistrust to

728
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,760
the open source then everybody starts

729
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,919
developing everything on their own the

730
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,240
speed of development goes down and we

731
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,960
keep using the old well tried and tested

732
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,559
software

733
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:37,440
and

734
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,440
so

735
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,840
for us for instance

736
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:46,080
the question of expanding our repository

737
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,919
also requires a certain balance and

738
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,480
decision making if we add some million

739
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,919
packages are we prepared to maintain

740
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,320
this million packages adding a package

741
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,240
to a repository is not a problem but

742
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,360
it's just

743
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,320
like an ad hive in a forest

744
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,679
uh they brought a lot of twigs there and

745
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,360
so is there but what's happening inside

746
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,480
you don't know

747
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,760
so for us when we're talking about

748
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,120
server platform

749
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,200
uh we are actually facing a choice what

750
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,679
to do either build a server platform

751
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,120
that where everything would be

752
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,760
accessible or to build a trusted and

753
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,960
stable

754
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,880
server platform where a certain number

755
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,640
of components

756
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,000
will be trusted and tested out and we're

757
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,240
always at this uh balance

758
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,279
between

759
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,039
the capabilities

760
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,039
to maintain to develop

761
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,440
and the market needs it's a difficult

762
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,840
story actually

763
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,039
got it

764
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,720
i just uh wanted

765
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,600
to

766
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,640
shift the direction in a different

767
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,760
direction

768
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,840
so it's a humongous task and indeed we

769
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,559
see

770
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,600
three approaches of what roma says that

771
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,760
slowing down the development of pace

772
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,840
within the company second

773
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,000
some commercial collapse

774
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,840
or collab collaboration where several

775
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,880
companies

776
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,679
uh

777
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,000
join their efforts to

778
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,799
replace some open source

779
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,039
codes and discuss things with the

780
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,000
ministry of digital development to form

781
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
some local community so which of the

782
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,279
three routes

783
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,679
looks safer and better and more

784
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,679
effective

785
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,559
it's a question to you

786
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,799
how uh according to you if this is a

787
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,240
commercial initiative will you be

788
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,039
prepared as a company uh to consume

789
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,679
commercial commercial russian open

790
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:38,000
source

791
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,089
[Music]

792
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,159
well you know it doesn't sound uh like a

793
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,799
swear word i mean russian open source

794
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,799
there are quite a lot of companies who

795
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,679
are contributors to open source

796
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,960
projects you take soul lab

797
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,360
i think it all depends on the goal and

798
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,840
the purpose because what roman has been

799
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,360
talking about if we're talking about an

800
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,240
operating system and alexander

801
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,799
talked about that earlier showing an

802
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,040
example of implementing of

803
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,119
the realization of a threat where

804
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,320
someone was storing a project on github

805
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,280
then

806
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,960
the domain

807
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,760
has

808
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,719
been purchased by someone else and

809
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,320
so

810
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,399
links and feedback started to get

811
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:25,520
through

812
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,719
this this vector of attack is probably

813
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,679
uh for those who make operating systems

814
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,359
for use in defense and government

815
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,320
for them this would be a critical vector

816
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,960
in this case they will indeed

817
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,320
have to watch the contributors and those

818
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,079
who are writing anything for this open

819
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,560
source project yes here is a separate

820
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,679
headache

821
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,000
i uh just

822
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,320
started to think about it and there are

823
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,399
lots of problems uh if it's about a

824
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,480
commercial project

825
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,960
well perhaps it's a question

826
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,720
of

827
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,079
weighted risk

828
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,599
and criticality

829
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,839
because if in some commercial

830
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,320
products

831
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,920
a library is to be used

832
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,040
that

833
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,200
works with user data and you don't know

834
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,960
anything about this library then it's

835
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,200
your risk and perhaps you have to

836
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,800
understand this risk

837
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,359
or you're right yourself

838
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,040
so i think

839
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,960
that

840
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,760
the russian open source community

841
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,320
will exist in any event that's the first

842
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,720
thing and second this whole story uh is

843
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,078
going to end sooner or later

844
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,880
so i think

845
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,520
so that one way or the other people will

846
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,160
find contact points

847
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,800
and developers

848
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,520
are a very alive

849
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,839
thriving

850
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,920
i mean the community developed developed

851
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,280
community

852
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,520
is a thriving organism and they will

853
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,920
find points of contact

854
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,200
if

855
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,040
there is going to be some

856
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,560
specific russian branch of that

857
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,359
community well let it be i don't see

858
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,240
anything bad about it

859
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,119
i

860
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,280
will put it this way

861
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,680
as far as open sources are concerned i

862
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,880
would not

863
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,520
uh support erecting barriers

864
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,079
between countries but when we talk about

865
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,320
commercial companies actually i would

866
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,119
like to draw the line here

867
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,400
because the

868
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,280
general attitude is that open source is

869
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,599
a free software no

870
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:46,320
the software can be quite commercial but

871
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,240
the source code would be open

872
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,040
so

873
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,680
talking about open source

874
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,839
software one of the ideas that's

875
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,720
mentioned as a foundational one

876
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,880
for this approach is that if the code is

877
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,240
open then a lot of eyes

878
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,200
look at it and so putting something

879
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,839
there that people would notice is much

880
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,760
more difficult and partly what's

881
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,960
happening now

882
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,079
confirms this because all these stories

883
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,000
with code injection

884
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,839
get to be known because

885
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,040
people uh

886
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,520
come to find these things

887
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,480
right

888
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,280
so uh as far as barriers are concerned

889
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,760
so that you should need russian open

890
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,480
source uh different from the worldwide i

891
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,240
don't think uh we should exclude

892
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,480
ourselves from the worldwide open source

893
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,359
movement but if the company is using

894
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,000
such projects then of course

895
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,720
uh

896
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,040
there'll be more attention to sdlc i

897
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,480
think the attention to the control of

898
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,560
third-party code

899
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,000
security

900
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,359
control

901
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,880
should become much more important

902
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,119
but again

903
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,640
putting barriers

904
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,560
at the open source levels i think that

905
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,079
would be a wrong thing to do

906
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,240
thank you rahman

907
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,720
can i have a say as well

908
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,960
actually the idea of bringing

909
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,280
all the developers into a single

910
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,720
distribution

911
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,960
i think it's quite utopian

912
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,280
it's just like let's bring together all

913
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,240
the av developers to bring a good av

914
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,599
product

915
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,000
i would just like to add one thing uh to

916
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,040
uh this whole discussion

917
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,160
we have been uh talking uh about

918
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,320
hazards or

919
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,800
for supply chains during the military

920
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,599
operation but actually it's a

921
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:42,640
very

922
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,760
specific

923
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,440
uh problem

924
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,880
and

925
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,480
there's a worldwide problem uh to

926
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,680
maintain

927
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,960
uh supply chain and google and microsoft

928
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,680
have a project now

929
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,280
to look for key projects their automatic

930
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,040
verification you can look it up

931
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,359
and indeed

932
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:08,160
there's a question that comes

933
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,599
about identifying key components

934
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,079
on which a whole range of technologies

935
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,119
depend

936
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,240
so that these key components

937
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,480
should be paid more

938
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,280
serious and higher attention

939
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,440
because we've indeed looked at this

940
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,480
project

941
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,400
this project deserves a serious

942
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,040
attention uh there's a formula uh to

943
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,040
assess the criticality for instance as

944
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,880
part of this project there are automated

945
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,839
quick scripts uh that check a lot of

946
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,000
github repositories

947
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,160
uh to remove

948
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,720
the vulnerabilities timely and other

949
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,240
things

950
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,359
so i think

951
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:48,800
uh

952
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,200
the problem of attacking uh supply

953
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,240
chains

954
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,720
is common for the entire world

955
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,599
and second that you need

956
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,320
to make efforts worldwide on a worldwide

957
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,440
scale

958
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,440
and verification of such

959
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,319
repositories identifica identification

960
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,160
and ranking of key technologies that we

961
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,640
all depend on

962
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,280
indeed it's a worldwide problem i

963
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,520
wouldn't just uh

964
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,200
restrict myself to the russian borders

965
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,400
well thank you

966
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,760
well optimism for three companies

967
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,720
in

968
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,640
a row

969
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,839
that the open source will regulate and

970
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,359
help us

971
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,040
to go away

972
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,680
from such a politically motivated cases

973
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,319
i'm happy to hear that so if the picture

974
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:39,200
is

975
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,720
well looks just like this it's good news

976
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,879
but

977
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,200
real life may be quite different and

978
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,880
we'll see

979
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,440
what the regulations will look

980
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,520
wrapping up and going back to the theme

981
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,240
of classical supply chain i would like

982
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,760
to ask

983
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,319
about the internal philosophy

984
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:03,440
i won't hide for me

985
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,920
we see the topic of supply chain for

986
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,359
we've been seeing it for quite a long

987
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:08,240
time

988
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,520
and so we have watched what's been

989
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,240
happening there we've noticed that it's

990
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,640
it's been growing year and year

991
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,920
in a more classic uh approach uh where

992
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,200
it outsources and code developers uh

993
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,359
were dealing with the supply chain not

994
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,760
extending it to the entire community

995
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,680
so it looks uh like

996
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,440
this uh

997
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,119
makes a lot of

998
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,720
sense

999
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,960
so

1000
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,040
not to trust anything

1001
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,319
that comes from the outside

1002
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,240
so it's dangerous

1003
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,480
how does it look for all three of you

1004
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,560
involved in the cyber security

1005
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,599
theme

1006
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:54,240
which have you uh started to

1007
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,200
trust less to foreign

1008
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,760
developers or external developers

1009
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,839
or maybe nothing has changed you just

1010
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:04,319
formally

1011
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,599
put up the consoles

1012
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,480
oh as father writer said it is just

1013
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,280
going to go away someday and life is

1014
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,119
generally the same

1015
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,079
roman i suggest we'll start with you

1016
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,200
well i'll give a brief answer for us

1017
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,280
the uh problem of trust

1018
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,440
to

1019
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,119
the software that we haven't built

1020
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,079
ourselves has always existed we now

1021
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,160
increase the number of verification

1022
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,839
efforts and checks

1023
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:38,079
and

1024
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,560
but we've seen this uh thing for quite a

1025
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,160
long time so globally nothing has

1026
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,240
changed for us we just allocated

1027
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,480
additional resources to perform

1028
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,119
activities that we have been doing all

1029
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:51,440
the time

1030
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,359
i'll give a brief answer on the whole

1031
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,480
in a moment

1032
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,400
there is indeed a certain

1033
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,720
trust crisis

1034
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,359
and we on our part

1035
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,599
have also introduced

1036
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,119
certain

1037
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,560
activities

1038
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,839
as part of the

1039
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:13,200
development process and also

1040
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,000
in terms of using the resources that we

1041
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:16,880
have

1042
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,680
we

1043
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,240
have never been big proponents of cloud

1044
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,560
services even though we have

1045
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,480
consumed something in our model

1046
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,119
and naturally uh quite a serious risk

1047
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:28,079
arose

1048
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,440
of this

1049
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,880
just uh being shut down

1050
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,359
and now we have certain long-term

1051
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:36,960
activities

1052
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,880
aimed at

1053
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,040
making the company more autonomous

1054
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,560
and a lot of companies are doing exactly

1055
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,720
the same thing it's quite natural

1056
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,720
looking forward everything will develop

1057
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,760
on

1058
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,960
the

1059
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,800
way the situation plays out

1060
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,920
i'm sure

1061
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,280
that

1062
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,800
the

1063
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,079
power of the human kind as a whole

1064
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,800
however pathetic it might seem to you uh

1065
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,680
is in collaboration in working together

1066
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,599
and i'd like to believe that this is a

1067
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,200
moment like this and it's not going to

1068
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,200
lead to a global fragmentation of the

1069
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,079
world

1070
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,800
and to a global crisis of trust i

1071
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,599
wouldn't like it all to lead there

1072
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:20,400
well but so far the emotion is going

1073
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,680
that way

1074
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,160
and the companies including our own

1075
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,880
uh proceed

1076
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,680
to reduce the level of trust to the

1077
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,160
vendors

1078
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,800
what questions

1079
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,079
and it's not

1080
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,119
uh we're not just an i.t uh function

1081
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,040
we're also a logistical company our

1082
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,640
supply chain is about logistics

1083
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,119
worldwide so you mean the real shipments

1084
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,280
real deliveries rather than software

1085
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,000
shipment yeah people

1086
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,560
uh joke in our company we'll have

1087
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,440
containers because because we love boxes

1088
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,359
i think

1089
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:02,839
any crisis uh puts it all on

1090
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:06,000
relationships let me just philosophize

1091
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,800
so all this arrogance goes away

1092
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,880
and

1093
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,040
so only the most honest ones stay

1094
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,119
so i

1095
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:18,359
uh think

1096
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,480
in the interaction with some suppliers

1097
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,400
you uh well the first thing that should

1098
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,560
be uh instilled

1099
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,920
is trust

1100
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,960
so how long are you going to work with

1101
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,920
uh us you sure it makes

1102
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,319
sense for us to work with you i'm not

1103
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:37,599
going to leave

1104
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,760
and for those companies

1105
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,000
that

1106
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,160
can

1107
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,079
that have left and are going to come

1108
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,480
back so question for them is next time

1109
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,319
are you going to leave again

1110
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,079
how are you going to confirm that and

1111
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:52,800
that

1112
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,200
refers to both large players and small

1113
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,160
ones

1114
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,560
it applies to both infrastructure and

1115
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,240
software so the question is about

1116
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,160
integrity is it it's a question about

1117
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,800
honesty and trust

1118
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,960
okay i think we're wrapping up on a

1119
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,720
positive note all the speakers and

1120
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,960
participants in the round table believe

1121
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,720
that the world is not going to change in

1122
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,079
principle it will all go away and we'll

1123
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:17,359
just move

1124
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:20,160
to a better relationship and we should

1125
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,359
need uh bring our anxiety level down but

1126
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:25,040
nevertheless the supply chain is an

1127
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,000
important thing everybody

1128
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,760
is thinking about how to protect it and

1129
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,000
we'll be looking ways to do that

1130
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,960
with this i'm wrapping up our meeting

1131
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,640

1132
