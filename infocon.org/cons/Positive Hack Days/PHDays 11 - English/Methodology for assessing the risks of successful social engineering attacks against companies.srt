1
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:04,319
my

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:05,359
name is

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,599
yuri drug and i work in starfish

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,719
and let me introduce some methods for

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,839
assessing risks that you can

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,920
use in your organization

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,920
to assess how

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,760
hard it will be to hack your org

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,039
using the open data

10
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,119
whether they can be whether this data

11
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,119
can be used for for an attack

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,280
and we have two categories here

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,239
by the showheads who is cybersec here

14
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,600
pentesters

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,079
white hat

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,239
okay thank you

17
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,719
the ones who did not raise their hands

18
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,760
obviously blackheads

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,760
so

20
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,920
the plan is we

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,239
run test

22
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,760
emailings then calculate email addresses

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,040
then

24
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,320
calculate risks and reduce risks

25
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,439
so test mailings this practice is

26
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,400
present you can run

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,200
training attacks on

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,320
your users or

29
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,520
the customers users you can

30
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,600
run to exercise attacks

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,000
and it's especially useful for

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,159
the security

33
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,640
team because they have the list of

34
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,200
employees

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,159
and i'll give you an example

36
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,600
with

37
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,159
every victim of every vector

38
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,040
so for 20 out of 100

39
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,600
we will say that of course okay every

40
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,119
fifth person is vulnerable

41
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,799
and if you send those

42
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,640
if you've sent those two mailing

43
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,759
distributions then you can benchmark

44
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,280
the worldwide benchmark is uh

45
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,840
uh the b4 uh

46
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,959
is

47
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,440
would roughly say that it's four percent

48
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,959
of vulnerable

49
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,160
personnel

50
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,200
so four percent would be a good result

51
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,200
one of 25

52
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,879
is a great

53
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,440
result and to compare one of three

54
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,000
like one third of the company which is

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,760
very

56
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,200
usual

57
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,800
state of affairs

58
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,560
not only in russia

59
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,360
it's a bad result

60
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,480
here's an example of

61
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,959
efficient exercise

62
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,640
200 people has opened in the email

63
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,400
the

64
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,239
labor protection group

65
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,000
everyone opened

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,160
the

67
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,440
[Music]

68
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,800
email 199.

69
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,480
went

70
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,640
and clicked on the link

71
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,239
24

72
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,879
have avoided

73
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,319
only 24

74
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,640
credentials were gathered

75
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,440
so

76
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,840
every eighth twelve percent

77
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,720
the example is here

78
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,159
zero and an m wasn't were highlighted

79
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,560
the original domain had two letters

80
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,480
switched

81
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,239
and the sender was the wrong one it was

82
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,519
imitating google docs

83
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,640
of course google was not used because

84
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,839
chrome would block it

85
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,120
and example online was a different

86
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,840
domain not the one

87
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,400
that the

88
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,280
organization used

89
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,760
so let's

90
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,319
dig deeper

91
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,239
hunter io is a paid service but we can

92
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,400
actually use the free version that shows

93
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,239
us the number

94
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,360
the amount of uses

95
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,079
this information is in the open source

96
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,839
and if you pay like five dollars you can

97
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,720
download those users list

98
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,479
and you can even move further and deeper

99
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,720
using social networks like contact

100
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,440
linkedin facebook

101
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,880
and you check

102
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,880
who has

103
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,280
published the data saying yes i work in

104
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,840
this company

105
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,880
honda io can be used to

106
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,560
create an email

107
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,560
you know name and surname patroname

108
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,800
i can get the

109
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,720
employees from the social networks

110
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,080
create some amount of emails

111
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,960
to broaden the

112
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,758
number of emails

113
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,720
let's start with hunter io

114
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,840
calculate the amount of users

115
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,840
so i t is leading

116
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,720
nearly one third of the email addresses

117
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,120
of the organization are

118
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,199
published

119
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,880
and if you go

120
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,360
social

121
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,039
it's roughly 96

122
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,759
so they have published all their

123
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,600
emails of their

124
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,840
i.t people

125
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,479
online

126
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,960
for other industries it's lower but

127
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,960
and we don't name mention the company

128
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,639
names

129
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,840
so

130
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,000
the risk estimation

131
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,320
phishing reports

132
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,740
after the

133
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,120
[Music]

134
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,440
mail distribution

135
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,919
it's not a benchmark but we just have

136
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,840
some ideas so if more than half of your

137
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,280
employees have reported that something

138
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,600
has been sent

139
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,000
it's great

140
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,120
every second person would be helping you

141
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,000
and by reporting

142
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,400
and ask the actor if

143
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,160
he sends more than two letters you will

144
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,280
probably know

145
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,400
about this attack

146
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,800
and if it's less than five percent

147
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,680
then i see risk managers using those

148
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,800
smiles

149
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,039
to estimate the

150
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,280
state of affairs just to get to

151
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,680
relax a bit the most complex slide is

152
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,080
this one

153
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,800
let's look at the results and assess the

154
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,199
risks

155
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,400
i have some metrics

156
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,560
and some results to understand

157
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,199
how it works so we have 20 vulnerable

158
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,880
employees per 100

159
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,360
and it was described and i described

160
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,360
them on harbor

161
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,520
so every fifth

162
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,680
was leaked they

163
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,919
got 12 reports

164
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,840
every eight

165
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,400
so then the

166
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,639
the actor needs to send five

167
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,319
letters to get

168
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,120
one credential

169
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,440
they have like 436 emails

170
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,919
and only every eights will send the

171
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,318
report

172
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,680
to be

173
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,680
a little bit scientific

174
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,199
let's divide

175
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,960
the average

176
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,599
amount of vulnerable employees divided

177
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,720
by the

178
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,720
amount of reports it's 0.6

179
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,680
we send only five letters but only

180
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,160
every one in eight employees will report

181
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,199
it

182
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,680
so the chances of the successful attack

183
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,280
without reporting is quite high

184
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,319
but the risks can be just estimated and

185
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,639
forecasted

186
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,759
so let's reduce the risks

187
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,080
speaking of the email addresses that are

188
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,599
published

189
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,679
and that can be gathered

190
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,958
to get information about york

191
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,120
you might need to reduce the

192
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,240
amount of emails published

193
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,159
not everyone actually has

194
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,480
such such a bad situation

195
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,760
you have organizations with 6 or seven

196
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,480
emails published

197
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,519
and if the amount of people

198
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,560
who click on the fishing links is low

199
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,279
then usually the

200
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,399
actors will choose another target

201
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,399
it's quite easy to reduce the amount of

202
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,399
emails of course

203
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,640
or you can also use

204
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,440
temporary emails for example for hr

205
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,440
sites

206
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,760
for the people who understand something

207
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,560
malicious may come

208
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,399
you can add prefixes

209
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,760
to the email

210
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,839
for the new employees you know if you

211
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,560
have 5000 of all ones yeah probably you

212
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,839
won't change their emails

213
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,920
but if you have a person and a

214
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,519
department

215
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,360
then

216
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,080
it will be harder for

217
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,160
a person to

218
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,920
calculate the

219
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,800
type the the prefix

220
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,279
you can use masks

221
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,600
names or names her name name just

222
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,399
abbreviations

223
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,200
to reduce the

224
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,399
the

225
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,560
simplicity of the patterns that can be

226
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,079
used to

227
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,839
identify the rules

228
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,959
and there are systems where you can

229
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,000
set up

230
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,079
say 25 emails come to the org

231
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,839
if they don't have

232
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,560
that those emails

233
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,839
you know

234
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,640
if they get 25 similar emails then the

235
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,800
security guy will check and block them

236
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,800
understanding what's going on

237
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,719
exercises

238
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,120
training

239
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,160
they

240
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,079
the employees need to know that you know

241
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,839
they can

242
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,680
report

243
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,200
the

244
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,440
the case in any it's in a very simple

245
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,399
form

246
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,560
and the training priorities

247
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,279
we have people that are

248
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,079
out in the wild

249
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,120
whose emails are published

250
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,839
they need to be trained definitely first

251
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,160
of all

252
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,079
they need to be the first target of

253
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,160
exercise then we need to train the

254
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,880
people in their

255
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,920
team so like with you know

256
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,440
labor protection

257
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,519
the behavior will be very similar

258
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,560
and they will be easy targets

259
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,079
i.t and

260
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,800
accountants will probably be

261
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,680
more

262
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,519
seen more often in as targets

263
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,720
and they usually do they they know a lot

264
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,440
yeah okay i won't be going

265
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,680
down that treblin rivet hall

266
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,760
you should train everyone in your

267
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,480
headquarters

268
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,399
and if they are imitated then the

269
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,399
branches can be also compromised

270
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,680
so if you need to prioritize here's the

271
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,079
sequence

272
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,399
there's a free tool maybe will help you

273
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,920
how to

274
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,079
understand that the link is fish

275
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,800
fishing and how to

276
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,920
understand that the file is is malicious

277
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,600
and of course top fishery

278
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,040
it has a bit more features than go fish

279
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,240
and it's part of the

280
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,040
russian software registry

281
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,440
a couple of links for those who did not

282
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,839
have time to

283
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,079
follow the qr code

284
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,399
for pen testers stopfish is the most

285
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,959
important one and for

286
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,160
the

287
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,880
ib service for info security service

288
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,959
there's also a set of resources then

289
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,000
thank you

290
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,399
and if you have any questions i actually

291
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,800
have a couple of gifts

292
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,080
so

294
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,320
[Music]

295
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,959
people asking questions we'll get some

296
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,639
some prizes

297
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,920
the books

298
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,160
social engineering books yes please

299
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,480
if you'd like to correct the

300
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,959
the estimation method then

301
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,040
thank you thank you for the presentation

302
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,839
and the question is you you send

303
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,440
your sean

304
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,800
an email

305
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,600
and

306
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,639
it has a google link how did you gather

307
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,399
the google

308
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,600
accounts

309
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,920
no we did not we just

310
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,199
took the list of people

311
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,760
because we are not testing the

312
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,920
infrastructure we are only testing the

313
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,240
people

314
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,000
we have our waitlists

315
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,600
same as whitelist same as uh

316
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,079
we are internal security so we don't

317
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,040
test the filters we only test the people

318
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,880
reaction

319
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,680
and

320
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,439
over here we also have a question

321
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,760
did you use canary tokens in your

322
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,240
practice and how effective they were

323
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,199
yeah we we started our pen test and

324
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,000
social activity starting with canary

325
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,199
tokens

326
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,639
or packing

327
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,560
executables with trackers

328
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,959
yeah we took a calculator

329
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,519
we needed a track

330
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,199
so we took the calc

331
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,160
and

332
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,920
exe

333
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,480
and enabled people to download it and

334
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,839
for some reason they they said you know

335
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,040
i have

336
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,839
mac os you know i cannot open it and we

337
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,720
gave them a different version and

338
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,199
we didn't use gofish we just used

339
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,440
cannery token for trekking

340
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,199
it's not much time so maybe the last

341
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,519
question

342
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,880
and if you raise your hand just come

343
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,959
come to me to get your book

344
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,720
a strange question but

345
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,920
we had 200 letters

346
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,040
sent

347
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,560
and only 24

348
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,399
people their credential but if they just

349
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,920
follow the link

350
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,519
yeah i agree absolutely if you just

351
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,240
follow the link

352
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,800
depending on the mastery of the social

353
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,839
engineer

354
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,480
they of course would ensure that eighty

355
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,759
percent will need to to do something on

356
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,959
on the side

357
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,120
some of our customers

358
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,480
calculate

359
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,880
following the link as an incident and

360
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,000
for some

361
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,800
they say you know if you run a macro so

362
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,199
if you get the credentials then it's an

363
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,599
incident

364
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,480
old people accountants how do you train

365
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,680
them

366
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,680
they don't want to get trained yeah we

367
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,000
had some cases like this with like 80

368
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,199
percent

369
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,480
uh you know ignoring the uh info

370
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,560
security service uh so they were

371
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,360
blacklisting them and ignoring them

372
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,000
so we used the quantum course

373
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,279
when the

374
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,399
uh

375
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,000
you know the employee has followed the

376
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,759
fishing link then

377
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,079
we showed them the screen

378
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,600
with training

379
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
highlighting where the mistake was and

380
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,559
explaining that this might lead to this

381
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,039
and if you'd like to

382
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,959
follow the course then people would

383
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,439
ignore it probably but after two or

384
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,319
three

385
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,280
incidents like that and the security guy

386
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,319
is showing the statistics you know with

387
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,760
people who are not trained uh still

388
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,400
you know in the list and 80 percent you

389
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,640
know being being good

390
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,360
then people start worrying and uh more

391
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,160
and train more and more so this is like

392
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,799
quantum course very short one

393
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,679
thank you colleagues thanks indeed

394
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,520
please come to get the books i'm here
