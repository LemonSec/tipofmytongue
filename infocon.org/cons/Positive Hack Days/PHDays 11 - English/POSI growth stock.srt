5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,000
known by everybody there are companies

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,600
which are legislators of fashion which

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,359

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,439

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,000

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,640
from positive technologies

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,439
the company which to my point of view

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,960
well only lazy people are not speaking

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,800
about it you know maxine

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,320
at a certain moment of time when there

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,520
was a

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,079
gap in sales very serious investor came

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,239
to me and said we understand everything

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,239
but we precisely know and it was in

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,360
march

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,239
that this company will feel okay they

21
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,559
will have a lot of clients

22
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,920
can we communicate with the guys we

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,360
would like to buy a share of this

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,120
company well i get in touch with your

25
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,000
guys

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,920
and they said you know we will think

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,920
about it we will look in this direction

28
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,760
and one month later i called them okay

29
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,000
what about it guys and they said you

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,800
know

31
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,239
you're so busy you're so busy

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,799
and i still didn't get an answer usually

33
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,920
it happens when the company feels good

34
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,479
and they don't need investors tell me

35
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,640
honestly do you need investors

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,840
well we do think about investors and if

37
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,560
you came to me evgeny i think we would

38
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,920
give you the answer and we would

39
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,400
communicate with these respected people

40
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,240
but jokes are jokes and honestly

41
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,799
speaking if you look at our employees

42
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,759
many on whom of whom are shareholders of

43
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,960
positive many of them they don't want to

44
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,759
sell positive technologies shares and

45
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,560
some of them are buying even more shares

46
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,920
from the market

47
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,360
it creates certain problems because

48
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,799
we've been expecting that they will

49
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,799
share with the market and they will sell

50
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,399
some of their papers but it happens that

51
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,000
they're holding them

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,920
even though the number of positive

53
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,159
shareholders have increased up to 45 000

54
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,280
from the initial 1400 people

55
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,680
which means yes we love our securities

56
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,320
we love our company but we invite

57
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,038
investors to become part and right now

58
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,599
we have 45 000 of them

59
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,239
maxim i have a principal question to you

60
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,840
i perfectly understand that

61
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,760
operationally you have great results and

62
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,959
we're going to speak about them a little

63
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,080
bit later

64
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,040
but

65
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,080
in the principle level recently

66
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,560
you are on a cutting edge there is a lot

67
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,480
of cyber attacks

68
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,440
you're involved in root you salvation

69
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,800
you're saving a lot of different

70
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,959
corporations salvation is a mutually

71
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,720
beneficial activity you protect

72
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,640
somebody's business and for you it's a

73
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,599
business

74
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,440
so i've looked at your indicators you

75
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,200
have significant growth of revenue

76
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,879
profitability of the business you have

77
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,959
reduced the debt of the company

78
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,360
everything's great about you and you are

79
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,120
very expensive and this is a normal

80
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,200
trend you are estimated according to

81
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,440
proper multipliers but i'll speak about

82
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,720
it a little bit later i have another

83
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,800
question what do you think everything

84
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
that happens right now is it

85
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,959
some short term trend or a hype or this

86
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,959
is uh what people just started

87
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,480
understanding

88
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,720
if you're asking generally about a cyber

89
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,280
security market growth and number of

90
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,840
clients who are caring about these

91
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,640
topics no i would say this was worsened

92
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,760
by

93
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,720
february events but the trend that

94
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,680
companies been spending much more back

95
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,159
in 2021 for the cyber security

96
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,879
so if we are going to look at our

97
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,640
financial indicators and the growth of

98
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,799
the business in the year 2020 two years

99
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,440
ago it has grown by 50

100
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,799
so if previously budgets that have been

101
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,440
spent by companies on average were and

102
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,400
it's a good indicator one percent from

103
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,280
total i.t expenses totality cost in the

104
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,000
year 2020 in the year 2021

105
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,080
right now everything's growing and the

106
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,879
company spends two three four five

107
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,239
percent from their i.t budget for cyber

108
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,120
security so everybody understand that

109
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,760
cyber security is a question of

110
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,720
survivability of the business and things

111
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,439
that we see this year yes geopolitical

112
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,160
events made the situation worse but the

113
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,478
fact that the growth of cyber security

114
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,959
is much ahead of general i.t market

115
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,680
growth both in russia and abroad we

116
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,240
could see that long time ago well you

117
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,440
remind me europe all those investors are

118
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,400
reminding me europe

119
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,240
do you remember americans have always

120
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,880
been demanding invest more in military

121
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,800
budget invest more in military budget

122
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,560
they said why why why and right now

123
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,680
they're increasing their military

124
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,919
budgets same thing same situation but we

125
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,240
understand cyber security

126
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,240
is one of the most powerful tools tools

127
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,160
of influence we understand everything

128
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,880
but i have another question let's think

129
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,800
we

130
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,320
and what is the most important thing for

131
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,360
the business scalability okay they are

132
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,840
going to invest more and more budgets

133
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,320
are going to grow

134
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,880
but where's the breakthrough

135
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,039
i want you to be still cheap enough well

136
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,199
compared to your breakthrough numbers so

137
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,120
that i would buy them can you convince

138
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,880
me that irrespectively too high

139
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,600
coefficients which are justified because

140
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,280
these coefficients they reflect your

141
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,720
future development they're not

142
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,440
sufficiently uh big enough and you will

143
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,440
cost even more expensive what is the

144
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,600
secret of your scalability

145
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,919
you're absolutely right and a serious

146
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,800
driver is a cybersecurity market grow

147
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,600
which grows faster in russia than abroad

148
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,960
because in the course of many years you

149
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,520
know russian companies private and state

150
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,440
ministries and departments we've been

151
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,360
much behind from the point of view of

152
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,880
cyber security uh

153
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,560
investments behind the western

154
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,000
communities you know western communities

155
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,759
they've been investing more in it so

156
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,319
russian market grows 15 to 20 percent

157
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,880
per year this is our assessments in

158
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,639
independent analytical agency

159
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,400
assessments and this year this trend

160
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,520
will continue so the market is growing

161
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,199
growing very fast and positive as a

162
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,120
company number one on this market is a

163
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,319
main beneficiary of it the second driver

164
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,160
and this is a geopolitical story

165
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,639
russian cyber security market is a

166
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,039
market of products

167
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,759
services and products about 80

168
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,800
of this market are products and until

169
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,400
recently

170
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,639
approximately 60 according to our

171
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,039
assessments of russian corporate

172
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,960
spendings for cybersecurity in the area

173
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,680
of products were products of western

174
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,800
companies american mostly of course

175
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,759
israeli are direct competitors so

176
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,400
starting from the end of february almost

177
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,360
all

178
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,199
big american and western vendors are

179
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,919
living russian market so this released

180
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,120
volume

181
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,360
which on a step-by-step basis is

182
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,880
dropping in the hands of russian

183
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,360
companies is on the level of 80 billion

184
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,520
rubles 80 billion uh from 180 billion

185
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,199
ruble topple market and they're falling

186
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,039
out of the hands of foreign companies

187
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,240
and they go in the hands of russian

188
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,000
cyber security companies this is the

189
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,280
second size and the third

190
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,039
the third topic is that this is a

191
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,919
question of technologies and visionary

192
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,680
of positive technologies because those

193
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,720
products that we make and especially

194
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,599
the new class of meta products is an

195
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,560
absolutely different level of business

196
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,120
these are sales of not one separate

197
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,120
solution in a certain niche this could

198
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,160
be a firewall and cm but this is a

199
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,039
resultative complex security and these

200
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,319
are our meta products o2 which from the

201
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,800
point of view of ticket and volume of

202
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,160
sales

203
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,800
is significantly better than any average

204
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,720
sale that we've been making so our main

205
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,520
vector is selling meta products complex

206
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,120
solutions which include all our products

207
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,680
under the hood and o2 is a flagship our

208
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,000
main meta product and from the sale of

209
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,240
this solution and russian market and in

210
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,039
the future abroad in friendly countries

211
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,520
this is a driver number three for such

212
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,000
innovative growth that's why i think

213
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,080
that we have all the components for

214
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,000
success and this is what makes us

215
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,080
believe that positive will be much more

216
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,400
expensive than today in the future

217
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,599
so i have the following question you've

218
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,160
been speaking about friendly countries

219
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,199
you know the meaning of life of any man

220
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,320
or business as academician soccer set is

221
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,080
an expansion expansion

222
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,519
any business is developing you've been

223
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,519
speaking about friendly countries how

224
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,640
powerfully you will go abroad with your

225
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,560
products and if it's not a secret can

226
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,839
you share with us we understand

227
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,320
competitors are not sleeping and maybe

228
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,320
under the table

229
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,480
they're listening to us apart in which

230
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,600
direction will you move

231
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,640
you see

232
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,680
global

233
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,000
globally or geopolitically because we

234
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,320
should look at this context constantly

235
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,880
cyber security is a question of

236
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,880
sovereignty

237
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,360
digital sovereignty over a separate

238
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,279
company industry or a state

239
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,959
geopolitically the world is divided into

240
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,199
three

241
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,959
it was always like that but right now

242
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,800
it's more acute and this is something

243
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,959
that we have in the western bloc and

244
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,839
companies products which exist on that

245
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,720
market then it's china with their own

246
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,440
solutions and products which they don't

247
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,760
sell to the external market this is a

248
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,600
closed system

249
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,680
and remaining world everything that we

250
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,800
can cut away from geopolitical block of

251
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,440
west and china this is the market for

252
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,839
which we might pretend with our products

253
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,080
and solutions

254
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,080
i make a lot of examples it's a real

255
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,160
example but it reproduces itself every

256
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,240
time one of the company's

257
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,680
largest biggest uh holding in emirates

258
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,399
came to us recently with the request to

259
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,279
sell our products to them all of us

260
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,880
all of our products the

261
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,959
package from 15 products and solutions

262
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,440
and when we came to tune up these

263
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,079
solutions we could see that they use all

264
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,399
arsenal they they use all solutions from

265
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,480
american vendors i asked them why do you

266
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,959
do that they say we don't trust anybody

267
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,480
and this is an answer to your question

268
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,720
where's the market the market is

269
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,959
everywhere all the countries which are

270
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,680
not part of the influence of china or

271
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,600
the western united states this is our

272
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,600
market and i believe that in the next

273
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,079
three years

274
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,680
right now our sales outside of russia

275
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,240
and cs is two percent i believe and i'm

276
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,680
confident that sales in non-russian and

277
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,800
cs countries will grow significantly in

278
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,880
nearest years and it's not gonna be two

279
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,320
percent it's gonna be dozens of

280
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,160
percentages in the next two three years

281
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,800
with the o2 class solutions will cover

282
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,440
uh demands of not only one company not

283
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,680
only one holding but the whole industry

284
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,480
or even the country

285
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,800
you've mentioned china but you know

286
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,360
these chinese you give them finger they

287
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,839
will cut away your hand don't aren't you

288
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,200
afraid that they will actively

289
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,120
copy some of your things and they will

290
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,519
start their regular chinese approach or

291
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,279
maybe you faced things like this

292
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,399
previously and you have your own

293
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,160
solutions well speaking about

294
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,880
reproduction of some common products

295
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,720
technologies which can be materialized

296
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,399
of course china is known for copying and

297
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,360
reproducing them and basically this is

298
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,720
uh ip and know-how theft but when we

299
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,040
speak about companies which manufacture

300
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,120
software

301
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,640
what is the main asset of these

302
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,880
companies people

303
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,920
knowledge

304
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,160
and knowledge is owned by people so i'm

305
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,800
not afraid that one morning we will see

306
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,040
that all are employing are sitting in

307
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,079
the train and moving to china

308
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,040
we have very loyal and strong team

309
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,240
we don't

310
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,519
have uh

311
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,600
well only a few people 20 people have

312
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
left to

313
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,160
countries and some of them are returning

314
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,040
back that's why i don't believe that

315
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,480
china represents threat of stealing our

316
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,399
intellectual potential these are our

317
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,360
people they are with us and we are with

318
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,480
them

319
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,639
we had 1200 people recently a couple of

320
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,880
months ago right now we have 1300 people

321
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,200
and we still have 200 vacancies we are

322
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,240
growing

323
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,959
so today i'm rating mass media the main

324
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,680
problem in your sector and it's

325
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,880
developing its lack of specialists

326
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,320
where do you find those talents

327
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,480
well i have the answer and i will extend

328
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,920
your question

329
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,680
how the industry leaves buddhists and

330
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,519
how the clients live police and how a

331
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,279
tea companies live within especially

332
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,920
positive technologies well with positive

333
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,480
technologies everything is all right

334
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,320
right now respectively to the situation

335
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,160
that many western communities russian

336
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,200
companies

337
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,279
are helping for their employees to

338
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,760
relocate i mean i.t specialists

339
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,959
nevertheless

340
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,600
it's not been publicized many companies

341
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,240
have left the market and left many of

342
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,160
their employees they've been basically

343
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,200
fired they're i.t specialists

344
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,160
even though some of them are very strong

345
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,959
technically strong and many of them are

346
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,720
coming to us not just people are coming

347
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,959
to us the big teams are coming to us

348
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,160
stars star teams

349
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,800
it's not a secret intel has left russia

350
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,560
and approximately 300 intel employees

351
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,880
stayed without a job they've lost their

352
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,360
job so they come with the full teams and

353
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,440
they say okay we are specialists in this

354
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,000
area we're technical developers we want

355
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,279
to work for you so positive today does

356
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,680
not have any difficulties in searching

357
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,279
for good stars and we are growing but

358
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,040
answering your question what about

359
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,199
general situation in industry it's a big

360
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,440
problem especially

361
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,160
in the area of cyber security employees

362
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,040
because on an annual basis in russia

363
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,320
qualified employees in this discipline i

364
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,040
would say approximately 1 000 new ones

365
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,800
are being trained by the demand on the

366
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,000
market and we'll speak about it during

367
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,560
the session about tens of thousands so i

368
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,800
don't believe that companies will be

369
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,600
able to solve this problem of complex uh

370
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,839
defense by hiring more and more people

371
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,079
that are not qualified people in market

372
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,000
these solutions are in automation the

373
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,880
solution is in the products which will

374
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,720
identify hikers instead of people will

375
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,199
stop attacks instead of people so we'll

376
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,440
play functions of cyber security

377
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,279
intellectually with the usage of recent

378
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,480
technologies automatically

379
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,360
you are lucky

380
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,920
just prior to

381
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,519
you came to the stock exchange and you

382
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,880
came to the stock exchange without

383
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,880
market maker without anybody you said

384
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,959
well who wants to buy our shares and

385
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,720
people started buying your shares it was

386
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,600
a success and you had a very good price

387
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,639
with good multiplies western multipliers

388
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,639
and more expensive than many western

389
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,160
companies because the market has

390
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,519
compared you with other ones and we've

391
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,600
made an assessment and it was alongside

392
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,600
with the market opinion and what is

393
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,120
really cool about it yes we understand

394
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,440
that market has dropped and your

395
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,279
exchange rates have returned and your

396
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,240
price is the same and in dollar value

397
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,480
you cost even more expensive

398
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,720
more than you cost before ipo i'm

399
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,800
speaking about public ipo at the same

400
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,600
time you hire more people which means

401
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,519
for you this is a great tool of

402
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,279
subsidizing those people so you

403
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,279
stimulate them so i have the following

404
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,120
question are you going to increase free

405
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,480
float

406
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,639
we do want to increase free float but

407
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:49,759
you see

408
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,360
free float

409
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,240
is something that defines the value of

410
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,079
the company free float should be

411
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,120
sufficient to have sufficient liquidity

412
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,360
so that larger investors would be able

413
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,680
to enter and look at the securities so

414
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,000
yes we would like to increase free float

415
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,199
however

416
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,519
our main objective is to increase

417
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,120
liquidity

418
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,320
and

419
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,000
so that more investors would pay

420
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,519
attention to our papers and this would

421
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,759
influence even more positively to the

422
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,720
cost of these shares and as we believe

423
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,639
even more justified assessment of

424
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,639
positive would happen

425
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,800
you have very non-standard policy in the

426
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,240
area of dividends i've been speaking

427
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,079
with you and maximum and say yura why

428
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,600
are you so

429
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,759
why are you so generous that we should

430
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,079
be we should give people opportunities

431
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,160
and you will continue being like that

432
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,360
with your dividends definitely we will

433
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,800
just a second

434
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,639
so specifically think of application

435
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,519
i understand that maybe i use my

436
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,360
business position

437
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,759
and i'm telling two videos it's not a

438
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,399
product placement we are not agitating

439
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,399
evgeny

440
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,920
well just a second

441
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,160
i'm entering tinkoff and i see how much

442
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,920
free money do i have okay positive

443
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,359
technologies

444
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,319
you're minus 1.8 percent today it's a

445
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,760
good chance to buy so i want to buy you

446
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,160
okay let's do it right now yeah at this

447
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,839
moment of time

448
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,240
i don't see but i think that our viewers

449
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,760
they can say that this is a serious

450
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,679
intent what do you say

451
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,359
so you're making it seriously yes i'm

452
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,119
taking it seriously

453
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,160
so

454
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,679
so i've purchased

455
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:28,960
with the current price

456
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,120
so i've convinced you that we are good

457
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,400
investment tool you don't have to

458
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,240
convince me i'm following you but the

459
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,240
problem is that the main question to me

460
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,600
was what's going to happen with your

461
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,160
dividends you made a lot of money you

462
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,400
need to develop and euro says that if we

463
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
want we will borrow for the development

464
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,760
but we have to pay people and you

465
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,039
confirm to me that you will pay

466
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,720
dividends good dividends which means

467
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,200
that you will keep the old strategy

468
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,520
i'm buying your shares which is not less

469
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,440
than 50 of net profit and this is

470
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,600
something that we've done just recently

471
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,120
we've paid

472
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,679
950 millions for dividends 50 percent of

473
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,760
net profit of the last year and

474
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,440
previously our policy have been

475
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,039
published on our internet side these are

476
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,840
obligations to the market and investors

477
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,559
if the i.t company is successful we

478
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,320
believe that it has to be profitable so

479
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,440
it's a philosophical question we

480
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,600
shouldn't argue we are growing at the

481
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,440
account of our own investments at the

482
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,919
account of our net profit and after

483
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,480
these investments we have met profit on

484
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,240
a very high level uh 25 27

485
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,760
net profit margin 50 at least we stand

486
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,679
for dividends well you have great

487
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,760
marginality and it is growing it's

488
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,840
growing and this is very cool okay

489
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,559
