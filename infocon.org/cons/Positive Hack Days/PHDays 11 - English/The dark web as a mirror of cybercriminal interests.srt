1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,040
and i will continue

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,960
our broadcasting

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,080
of the first day of positive hug days

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,040
2022.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,480
right now we're going to speak about the

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,760
entity which

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,439
is any other related with hacker

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,000
activity we're going to speak about dark

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,160
net and for these

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,800
in this studio i have a guest radio solo

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,439
view of hello vadim hello julia

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,880
vadim is the head of analysis group for

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,200
cyber threats

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,120
cyber threats of information security

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,960
analysis group of information security

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,640
threats in positive technologies group

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,760
okay let's try to determine the concept

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,760
i know two words there's dark net and

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,520
there's dark net what is the difference

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,399
dark net as a technology first of all

21
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,440
it's closed resources of

22
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,600
well the access to which can be received

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,120
only using some third-party means

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,879
you cannot do it through regular browser

25
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,799
if we're speaking about as an example of

26
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:07,760
uh

27
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,760
darknet or you need to or browser there

28
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,840
are other examples dark web is a

29
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,360
combination

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,400
of illegal resources in the same dark

31
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,920
net

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,439
it's a narrow

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,759
concept speaking about a dark web and

34
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,280
dark net

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,080
okay

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,600
and today we're going to speak about

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,680
dark net or dark web okay let's speak

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,240
about dark web we are interested in

39
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,360
cyber crime hackers criminals that's

40
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,479
what you're interested in

41
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,840
are you involved how many years you're

42
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,520
involved in since i work in positive

43
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,240
technologies

44
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,119
and that's how i know about this topic

45
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,280
but i've started a little bit earlier

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,079
when i was doing computer expertise

47
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,840
so generally speaking more than six

48
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,920
years why you do that

49
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,320
why the information security specialist

50
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,280
is involved in dark web it's a wonderful

51
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,759
question

52
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,399
when i have to explain to students why

53
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,280
is it important to understand

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,080
much more the idea of dark web why is it

55
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,840
important to go there

56
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,400
because

57
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,000
we need to protect people from those who

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,720
live in this area not just from some

59
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,800
regulations you will protect it but you

60
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,959
will clearly understand

61
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,519
what is of their interests of those

62
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:32,959
criminals

63
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,519
what are their priorities and how do

64
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,160
they attack which tools do they use

65
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,560
which tools

66
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,360
right now are fashionable speaking about

67
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,840
trends

68
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,599
that's why

69
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,840
dark web

70
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,000
is very fruitful

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,239
land for cyber security and information

72
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,800
security in general you understand

73
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,040
attacker you know how to effectively

74
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,480
protect yourself and how the results of

75
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,879
your work are used in the company

76
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,159
speaking about positive

77
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,519
i've started dot dark web research in

78
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,959
order to forecast some threats forecast

79
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,959
some trends and

80
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,800
to be able to give recommendations for

81
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,840
our clients and uh for the white uh

82
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,879
society to our analytical reports which

83
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,519
are represented in our site

84
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,840
i've heard some legend

85
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,680
what it's very difficult to get into the

86
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,000
dark web

87
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,720
through which checks did you go to drop

88
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,879
that well it's not so difficult to drop

89
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,400
there

90
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,840
and you will be able to do that if i

91
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,200
will teach you teach me

92
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,200
we have been speaking about uh teaching

93
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,599
about how to check the vulnerabilities

94
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,680
uh fix the vulnerabilities

95
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,080
well it's not difficult to get there

96
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,200
and how can one get there

97
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,519
some guides or instructions well you can

98
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,560
find them in the internet if you

99
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,439
will try to find but nobody writes about

100
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,599
consequences

101
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,560
that

102
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,200
a visitor can bring upon himself or

103
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,519
herself and the consequences i mean that

104
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,680
you can enter a certain resource for

105
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,239
example

106
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,680
web server will log you in you will be

107
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,520
logged in uh the

108
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,160
logbook and if this resource will become

109
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,520
illegal

110
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,400
and you didn't know that and special

111
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,680
services will capture this resource and

112
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,080
there will be traces leading to you they

113
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,960
will have questions to you

114
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,720
that's why

115
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,199
and how do you clean your traces

116
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,240
well

117
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,840
i'm entering as anonymous

118
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,560
before you go to dark web you should

119
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,440
understand

120
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,360
how should you do it in such a way so

121
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,040
that race would not lead to you

122
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,759
at the same time these procedures

123
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,919
are not super difficult if you

124
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,240
understand them by the experience to

125
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,680
which you have to go in order to

126
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,800
understand how this can be done

127
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,720
it works in life and it works for an

128
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,240
extended period of time okay it's

129
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,840
understandable well it was a

130
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,600
philosophical answer

131
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,080
tell me what's new in dark web in 2022

132
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,560
because we lived almost what's new in

133
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,080
the dark web well it's an interesting

134
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,000
question

135
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
honestly speaking

136
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,960
if

137
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,759
we don't go into a super detail we can

138
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,880
refer

139
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,160
to an agenda to events

140
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,479
which recently happened

141
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,120
and we can refer to geopolitics

142
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,360
we see hackers who got active

143
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,800
make their attacks due to their

144
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,320
political

145
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,000
it's so-called activism they woke up

146
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,039
and when criminals attack companies not

147
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,000
to receive some financial profits but

148
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,800
for destructive purposes destructive

149
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,960
motifs plus some motifs to announce

150
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,560
about themselves and promote some other

151
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,039
point of view

152
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,000
this is number one something that people

153
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,840
will speak in the end of the year while

154
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,199
drawing the results speaking

155
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,840
in more detail about dark web topics

156
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,520
it's uh stealing databases

157
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,880
and this is very close to what i've been

158
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,720
speaking about in these databases they

159
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,720
have uh

160
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,560
hackers can make attacks on the basis of

161
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,800
this so one is connected with another in

162
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,639
addition to that

163
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,919
things that we've been speaking about in

164
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,160
the previous two years

165
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,280
ransomware attacks uh in quartering

166
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,720
encoding attacks they started

167
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,880
re-qualifying themselves and right now

168
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,080
in addition

169
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,800
to

170
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,520
encoding infrastructure to receive some

171
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,080
financial benefits they also offer cyber

172
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,199
spying

173
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,039
services

174
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,599
so if we have entered in this direction

175
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,520
it's not that just we can but we also

176
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,080
can steal some data and this data can be

177
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,080
sold and this can be done by the order

178
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,000
in addition to that

179
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,639
those who

180
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,080
previously been attacking with the

181
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,720
purpose of encoding

182
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,560
have re-qualified themselves into

183
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,039
activists right now they penetrate into

184
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,440
the infrastructure to destroy it so

185
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,840
everything is rotating around it uh all

186
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,479
the trends are rotating around it

187
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,160
that's it

188
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,039
what was happening last year

189
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,680
last year

190
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,240
i will form the top of the questions

191
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,160
with which journalists were approaching

192
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,000
me once again this is a reduction of the

193
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,080
encoder activities last year it was

194
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,759
seeming that the whole world understood

195
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,560
that encoders are the global threat uh

196
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,360
close to terrorism so we have to make

197
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,840
very active measures in this direction

198
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,240
otherwise community have encoded that

199
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,560
they will be uh pressed and they will go

200
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,919
underground

201
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,759
and people were approaching me with this

202
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,240
question the second question was related

203
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,000
to vulnerabilities

204
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,960
on the wave of the fact that previously

205
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,120
a lot of access rights have been sold

206
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,280
previously and criminals have been using

207
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,199
this access to penetrate into the

208
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,039
infrastructure and the access became

209
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,599
better controlled by organizations

210
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,840
perimeter

211
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,840
was more protected they paid more

212
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,840
attention to those accounts where do

213
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,599
they leak

214
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,880
who do they belong and where they come

215
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,559
from so the criminals have looked at

216
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,399
this and they said okay

217
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,159
we cannot go to these accounts okay

218
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,640
let's search for more technological uh

219
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,560
solutions and they came to

220
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,720
vulnerabilities and exploits

221
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,640
and there was a certain growth

222
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,080
of demand for exploits and zero-day

223
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,640
vulnerabilities

224
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,240
and it can also be justified by the

225
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,560
following

226
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,480
by the fact that those who've been

227
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,640
encoding infrastructure they've earned

228
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,800
money they already have earned money in

229
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,839
the year 2019 in the year 2020 in the

230
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,839
beginning of the year 21

231
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,920
and they have this money to buy zero

232
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,560
days to buy exploits and that's why

233
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,320
they're saying okay we have good access

234
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,880
and right now we are going to buy

235
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,600
missiles so they've moved to exploits

236
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,959
this is topic number two and topic

237
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,200
number three as strange as it may seem

238
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,279
it's very close to the topic of the dark

239
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,120
web but it's too far away from the

240
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,040
informational security

241
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,399
this is coveted certificates uh

242
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,040
fixed documents uh fraudsters schemes

243
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,959
and right now we see less of those but

244
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,839
last year it was about that

245
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,640
it was one of the main trends so right

246
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,320
now you've been speaking about sales and

247
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,480
purchases of resales and how all these

248
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,080
works is it marketplace uh you come

249
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,959
there and how can you find something how

250
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,399
can you pay how can you buy uh fines for

251
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,880
buyers and suppliers well you have good

252
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,279
understanding there are marketplaces

253
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,360
there is a special form these are

254
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,200
marketplaces which are managed in the

255
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,760
manual mode there are buyers there are

256
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,839
sellers it's understandable that in

257
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,240
condition of full anonymity

258
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,959
uh for which this dark weapon dark net

259
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,000
has been created it is difficult

260
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,360
david says

261
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,079
to trust and make the first step both

262
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,360
for the buyer and the seller because if

263
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,079
buyer takes and sells uh

264
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,399
money

265
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,880
he will get you know empty product or

266
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,720
will get nothing so one is lying to

267
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,040
another one and a symmetrical story with

268
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,880
the sales

269
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,120
sellers he can give his product in

270
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,399
advance and the buyer doesn't have any

271
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,000
money and he didn't have any plans to

272
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,120
pay he just wanted to get uh free of

273
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,959
charge some products or services so

274
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,399
organically

275
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,440
they've created some medium mediator

276
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,800
roles so middlemen roles who are called

277
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,440
guarantors and these transactions in

278
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,360
order

279
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,040
to make them

280
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,680
maximally safe

281
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,560
and to achieve results which are

282
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,240
expected by seller and buyer they are

283
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,680
done through these mediators or

284
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,040
guarantors

285
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,880
but does they take certain interest

286
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,880
rates for their work yes they do how

287
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,120
much i cannot tell you because it's

288
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,279
different from place to place it depends

289
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,440
from the situation from the volume of

290
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,839
transaction

291
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,120
from some share of percentage to several

292
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,360
percent points and which product is the

293
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,200
most expensive one that you've seen in

294
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,040
the dark wet and what was the cheapest

295
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,959
one everything depends on the category

296
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,959
we can speak about exploits we can speak

297
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,279
about uh

298
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,000
speaking about exploits uh i have seen

299
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,920
public ones which have been delivered

300
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,399
free of charge and zero day

301
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,920
which people were ready to buy for

302
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,760
millions of dollars millions of dollars

303
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,560
oh my and what they're paying with

304
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,360
bitcoins bitcoins

305
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,360
they need the means of payment which can

306
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,600
do it anonymously to transfer money from

307
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,440
one place to another bitcoin and other

308
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,440
cryptocurrencies

309
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,600
is there any division by geographical

310
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,639
sign in the dark web

311
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,320
this is an international story

312
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,920
buyers and sellers and visitors of these

313
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,959
platforms they can be from anywhere

314
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,639
there are certain languages of these

315
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,560
platforms in which they communicate but

316
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,480
most often this is english as

317
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,560
international language there could be

318
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,480
platforms where people speak russian as

319
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,519
well

320
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,639
and definitely foreigners using google

321
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,959
translated also can communicate russian

322
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,440
on those uh locations

323
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,920
there are some specialized local

324
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,959
platforms uh chinese turkish spanish

325
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,360
the one you will get this is the

326
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,560
language you will communicate and

327
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,079
visitors they can't be from anywhere

328
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,639
else which language do you communicate

329
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,519
i know russian and english

330
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,279
well if we are going to be broadcasted

331
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,680
and somebody uh will see you will they

332
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,200
kick you away from the dark web they

333
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,440
don't know who am i

334
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,040
well i'm not going to ask you who are

335
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,720
you and i wouldn't i wouldn't give you

336
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,839
the answer

337
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,240
so they use nicks

338
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,880
and is this nick is verified well you

339
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,720
can say whatever you say

340
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,000
they will call you this way and who

341
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,839
stands be behind the nick nobody asks

342
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:32,800
you

343
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,519
the only thing which might happen is a

344
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,920
certain

345
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,600
story

346
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,399
following a certain story or a reference

347
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,000
when you come to a new platform they can

348
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,839
ask you

349
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,079
what was your name on some other

350
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,839
platform so you need to give a certain

351
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,920
reference if you want to continue

352
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,199
development of your own avatar or a name

353
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,399
which you've had on the previous

354
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,279
platform or a neighboring one you can

355
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,560
call yourself with the same name and

356
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,639
that i came from that one to this one

357
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,240
with the same name first of all it's a

358
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,360
reputation when we speak about anonymity

359
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,040
reputation is the only currency

360
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,959
which can be used to build relations

361
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,199
between two anonymous people because

362
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,639
they know each other only by their

363
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,639
knicks and they know that in the course

364
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,800
of certain number of years they've been

365
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,320
writing to each other and nobody was

366
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,959
lying to anybody that's why behind this

367
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,399
sneak from this platform we have a

368
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,720
person whom we can trust and behind this

369
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
sneaker there's another person who i can

370
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,639
trust and if these sneaks have appeared

371
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,079
on other platforms there are no

372
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,399
references to those forms and no

373
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,480
possibility to verify it there is no

374
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,160
trust and a new person who comes and who

375
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,560
get registered there for example to

376
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,880
their new form the trust to this person

377
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,440
will be zero are there fraud stories yes

378
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,839
of course

379
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,560
so people are lying to themselves

380
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:02,160
well if you understand as a criminal

381
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,440
your phone your mail will not be

382
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,160
disclosed and somebody decides

383
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,000
that mine

384
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,760
lying to liars uh is like a robin hood

385
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,639
type of behavior and the possibility to

386
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,440
earn well what do you think

387
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,440
what will become popular in the dark

388
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,240
where in the nearest future it's an

389
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,399
interesting question and we've been

390
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,959
discussing

391
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,199
with our analytics about this particular

392
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,240
topic and following versions have been

393
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,320
announced for example

394
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,040
we believe that out of

395
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,040
more realistic ones i think in the

396
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,000
nearest future uh there will be a smart

397
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,920
passport

398
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,720
they will be broken they will be

399
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,079
fraud

400
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,600
this is one of the directions another

401
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,399
direction is well understandable one

402
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,040
autopiloted cars we're not speaking

403
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,320
about uh

404
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,720
stealing those cars but we can speak

405
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,000
about

406
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,880
breaking their

407
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,880
software to unlock certain functions

408
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,959
which previously were not accessible for

409
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,480
example in tesla

410
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,079
they do have different speed modes which

411
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,240
are available in this machine and this

412
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,440
is all limited by the firmware by the

413
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,839
soft parts so if people who know how to

414
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,160
program it from the chip tesla they can

415
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,160
make supercharged tesla from technical

416
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,120
point of view of course i'm

417
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,160
oversimplifying everything however

418
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,279
we can come to this another approach if

419
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,480
you look into the future

420
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,959
some cyberpunk will happen then of

421
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,480
course

422
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,279
dark web will not pass the topic of

423
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,959
different implants or carry devices uh

424
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:54,320
augmentations which will reinforce the

425
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,800
humans or their functions

426
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,399
bio prosthetic components eyes hands

427
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,880
whatever and what dark web can do there

428
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,119
well listen to this we're speaking about

429
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,679
uh firmware

430
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,520
there will be corporations that will

431
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,679
develop all of these

432
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,079
for example prosthetic of the hand or

433
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,319
exoskeleton which makes you stronger

434
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,720
for example it can be

435
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,240
created for certain conditions of

436
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,559
exploitation but it's going to be broken

437
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,520
and super reinforced exoskeleton which

438
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,919
allows you not only raise the boxes but

439
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,880
also run 100 meters in two seconds i'm

440
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,440
just simplifying however why not

441
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,720
and the final trend please

442
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,080
what do you forecast dddd the worst one

443
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,240
well the remote one and the worst one

444
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,240
yes of course the worst one and the most

445
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,480
interesting one

446
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,039
it's the interception of satellite

447
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,080
control

448
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,400
interception of satellite control and of

449
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,640
course they will be impacted against

450
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,320
each other they will be dropped on the

451
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,840
ground and it will be shown as a

452
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,360
technical error

453
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,080
well there are a few satellites what can

454
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,320
be impacted against which well we're

455
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,440
speaking about the future when there's

456
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,720
going to be a lot of them for example

457
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,080
russian companies and foreign companies

458
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,760
are actively launching a lot of

459
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,440
different satellites into their

460
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,679
constellations so in order to make

461
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,799
internet in order to

462
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,360
with the purpose of intelligence

463
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,320
activities or maybe scientific research

464
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,240
and we see more and more of those and

465
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,559
different heights and different orbits

466
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,440
and the space will be so uh that

467
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,240
congested that it will attract a lot of

468
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,720
uh criminals but team thank you very

469
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,360
much i think we have forecasted were

470
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,000
forecasted some

471
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,240
space collapse

472
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,520
which will be realized with the efforts

473
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,840
of dark web and would like to remind you

474
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,840
it was vadim solo view of the person who

475
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,919
researches dark weapon dark net any

476
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,520
company positive technologies thank you

477
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,720
very much

478
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,960
and please don't switch off next guests

479
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,240
are going to come here
