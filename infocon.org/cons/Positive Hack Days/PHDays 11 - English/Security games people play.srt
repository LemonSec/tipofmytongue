1
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,120
hello everyone

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,840
we'll give you two seconds to join okay

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,280
we are done

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,240
my name is alexey babanka

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,359
i work

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,190
for the nia platform

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,400
[Music]

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,760
and

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,480
we are the guys

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,119
who are supporting all the payments

11
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,040
despite visa

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,760
and mastercard living and we have made

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,640
this visa and we have this

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,000
quick

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,800
money transfer movements

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,200
so you now can transfer your cash to any

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,039
bank

18
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,079
so

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,800
no commission by the way

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,160
so thank you for your applause

21
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,680
so we come from the national payment

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,280
card system by the way nspk

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,000
so

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,760
in the past

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,560
i would spend 10 years

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,240
doing security things i was the pcie

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,560
auditor i audited the

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,080
payment

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,840
apps infrastructure and whatever

30
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,600
and for about 15 years ago i was

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,200
head of the cybers team we played ttf

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,159
and this is really important

33
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,520
and now

34
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,679
i'm

35
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,439
responsible for product security

36
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,680
this is the key thing

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,479
and i'm also an id manager a little bit

38
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,119
so some preface

39
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,479
do we have here people who test security

40
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,799
i mean products

41
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,960
okay great and what are the other people

42
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,439
doing here

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,040
okay jokes aside

44
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:05,600
well

45
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,719
i will be

46
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,280
talking more about security

47
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,479
testing

48
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,360
and

49
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,520
the second part will not be on i.t it

50
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,680
will be on business

51
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,520
so please

52
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,599
stay for this so if you deal with the

53
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,360
security systems

54
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,720
you find yourself in a cycle

55
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,760
when you find something

56
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,480
you find bags or bugs rather

57
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,680
then you

58
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,360
have tasks for them

59
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,480
they're fixed then we have more code

60
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,280
and more bugs

61
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,000
and this

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,239
runs in circles it looks like that

63
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,560
and this is not really nice since we the

64
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,000
security guys

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,080
have come here to do great things but we

66
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,800
need to find the same issues

67
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,680
in the code over and over again

68
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,840
similarly this is not the most pleasant

69
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,280
thing to do

70
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,760
if we start sorting it out to see why it

71
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,760
is happening

72
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,080
so people usually say that these

73
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,760
developers just don't want to do

74
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,720
anything

75
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,599
since

76
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,599
they are well whatever they just don't

77
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,040
want it

78
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,720
as a matter of fact

79
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,879
if you start thinking about it why it is

80
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,518
not happening

81
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,680
there are more reasons to it

82
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,799
and people

83
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,599
can be unaware of the need to do things

84
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,360
they can have

85
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,599
no knowledge how to do it and they can

86
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,840
be unwilling to do it if we talk about

87
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,159
the id guys well

88
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,319
not to want to do something well it

89
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,280
doesn't

90
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,920
happen often well if you don't ask

91
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,760
people to

92
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,000
well

93
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,000
author

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,280
regulations

95
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,599
so why people are not

96
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,720
coding properly well

97
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,280
some can say okay i cannot do it well

98
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,040
but usually they cannot do it because

99
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,200
not because they are stupid

100
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,200
well i mean it's

101
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,360
not rocket science to make

102
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,959
code secure

103
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,879
and i don't think that the developers

104
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,560
know that they need to do it but they

105
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,560
cannot do it well i don't think it's the

106
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,880
case

107
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,479
so i believe the root of the problem is

108
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,240
the lack of knowledge

109
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,280
and

110
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,080
this is quite natural

111
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,240
so the question is how come people don't

112
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,160
know this this is a bug

113
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,720
and uh so it was reported where was it

114
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,880
reported the

115
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,479
telegram channel on security well okay

116
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,680
we all have the professional deformation

117
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,000
we deal with the sources normal people

118
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,280
don't look at

119
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,680
so they are not interested in the leaks

120
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,880
and so on and so forth and the

121
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,199
developers are normal guys that's why

122
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,440
they don't look there

123
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,000
so the things which are obvious to us

124
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,039
can be

125
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,680
not obvious to the developers at all so

126
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,919
a vesps uh well can be something they

127
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,080
don't know

128
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,919
well

129
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,080
i believe that this is not new to you we

130
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,479
all understand this

131
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,360
and

132
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,800
there are ways to sort it out

133
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,680
and unfortunately these methods

134
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,240
they are weird sometimes

135
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,160
and well the first method

136
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,440
and i saw this

137
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,639
would be about like that okay

138
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,960
here's a link to the requirements do it

139
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,759
on your own okay this is nice

140
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,240
but i don't think this is uh the best

141
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,039
way to teach people to do things

142
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,320
there are

143
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,320
well

144
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,880
friendly guys who tell you

145
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,440
here are the regulations please do it so

146
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,759
they have downloaded the link

147
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,680
and uh well

148
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,919
you know

149
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,160
well the worst the situation the better

150
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,400
they will call it like

151
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,759
raising awareness okay no training

152
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,080
you cannot tell people we just read a

153
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,160
vesp to the developers well nobody will

154
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,680
pay for this but if you increase

155
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,120
awareness

156
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,280
so then

157
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,318
this is a different story

158
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
you know developers don't like reading

159
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,639
regulations

160
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,880
well maybe nobody likes actually reading

161
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,680
them

162
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,919
while somebody is writing them so maybe

163
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,520
they like reading them

164
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,639
well what i mean is that uh to give them

165
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,720
the standard and to say

166
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,039
so make it more secure

167
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,120
well this is not going to

168
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,000
fly

169
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,919
this is not going to work out

170
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,599
so the developer will read you know they

171
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,720
will read the title and continue

172
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,240
in their own ways and the coolest thing

173
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,000
is to

174
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,919
train people

175
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,720
elsewhere so we'll teach them how to do

176
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,759
it

177
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,960
well

178
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,960
okay

179
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,960
there are many issues here

180
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,120
well i mean what are you using

181
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,360
javascript okay then it'll be trained by

182
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,199
java it's java anywhere

183
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,639
so please go and be taught

184
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,440
well it's funny but sometimes the

185
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,479
mobile developers are trained by web

186
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,319
experts or

187
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,120
they

188
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,080
have a firmware for

189
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,800
microcontrollers and they need to

190
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,199
be taught on

191
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,520
vulnerabilities so the issue of training

192
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,879
is that it

193
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,400
is not targeting

194
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,160
your pain points

195
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,160
and okay you can have a certificate you

196
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,160
can print it out print it out but it

197
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,960
will be of not much use

198
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,800
all these methods

199
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,840
well if you need to

200
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,479
include this into your yearly report you

201
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,039
can use this method and that's what

202
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,479
they're good for

203
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,318
there are better ways to train people

204
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,240
and i believe it's more profitable

205
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,720
so the first way you can have best

206
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,479
practices

207
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:23,520
for instance

208
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,759
you can

209
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,280
tell people

210
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,120
how you should code with this stack so

211
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,919
that this vulnerability goes away that's

212
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,519
good you can have a look at this piece

213
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,200
of code uh this snippet and

214
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,080
use it

215
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,360
you can have security on boarding so all

216
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,599
the people who come to you

217
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,920
can be brought together and

218
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,040
informed

219
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,360
all the abc's because the guys who are

220
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,360
with you for a long time they have heard

221
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,839
something and the other ones

222
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,000
should be brought

223
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,640
to the same

224
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,600
level of understanding

225
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,480
okay

226
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,080
feedback

227
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,279
if you have a bug and if you find it and

228
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,680
if you fix it in the stack

229
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,399
so the guys who are in it are not

230
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,160
necessarily

231
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,880
equipped to understand the critical

232
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,040
criticality of it so if you have a bug

233
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,240
if it's not typical so maybe people kind

234
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,480
of missed it or they just didn't know

235
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,560
that it's a wrong way to do it so you

236
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,880
should call the guy tell them what the

237
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,160
risks are about so they'll avoid it

238
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,959
and then it's

239
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,120
in-house training so this is the top

240
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,360
thing because this way

241
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,760
you can

242
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,080
kind of uh

243
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,959
teach people what you want them to teach

244
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,839
based on your pain points so you can

245
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,200
learn on your mistakes

246
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,440
so i believe this is uh

247
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,560
the best option

248
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,440
now this is somehow justified

249
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,720
scientifically we can have a look at the

250
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,320
telling mo

251
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,600
teaching modes

252
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,480
we can have this uh tell show do

253
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,240
approach

254
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,040
so you show how to do it people try to

255
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,600
do it on their own okay this is a good

256
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,320
method and it is used at schools and

257
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,600
universities

258
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,120
and then they try to use it everywhere

259
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,839
else okay what's the issue here

260
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,560
it works well when people don't know

261
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,760
anything or when as back at school they

262
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,519
are receptive to the

263
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,959
fresh knowledge

264
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:37,760
so

265
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,240
they kind of hear those things from the

266
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,320
basics and upwards if you have somebody

267
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,120
with his her own experience

268
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,000
people will not uh you know like this

269
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,680
because they know something you start

270
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,399
with abc

271
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,719
a joke

272
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,279
okay you know if we invite you for a

273
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,880
training session

274
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,560
and start with the abc

275
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,160
okay you understand that that's uh

276
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,800
boring but when some interesting things

277
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,440
pop up you are not focused anymore

278
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,480
anyway

279
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,760
so we have another

280
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,160
cycle

281
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,839
for

282
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,959
so we call it the culver cycle

283
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:31,920
so

284
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,640
you

285
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,680
let the people use your experience then

286
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,560
you

287
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,320
look at the results

288
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,839
then you enrich their knowledge with

289
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,480
your expert knowledge and after that

290
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,880
they get some new experience and so on

291
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,760
so you do it in cycles

292
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,160
okay what is good about this model

293
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,720
so you are not starting from scratch you

294
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,480
are starting from

295
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,800
this threshold of lack of knowledge for

296
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,160
instance

297
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,560
apart from that so based on what has

298
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,560
been done

299
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,360
you

300
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,279
or what has been taught

301
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,560
you

302
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,519
add new things and this will cause more

303
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,560
trust

304
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,800
okay

305
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,959
why am i talking about it okay how can

306
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,839
you apply this uh model

307
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:18,639
so

308
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,279
mentors can play a good role here so you

309
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,600
have a manta for everyone and

310
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,560
this approach is used but this is

311
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,920
quite

312
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,279
expensive

313
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,200
and you can

314
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,800
have games

315
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,359
for instance

316
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,519
when they say well it's the same

317
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,360
mentoring but it's uh

318
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,120
done

319
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,020
and mess so

320
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,160
[Music]

321
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,959
so how did we start it

322
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,600
okay let us have a

323
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,680
ctf for our

324
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,760
technical guys so they try to crack

325
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,480
things and then

326
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,800
we see some practical results

327
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,279
okay why ctf i believe you all know what

328
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,839
ctf stands for capture the flag right

329
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,120
so

330
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,800
if you don't know this you can

331
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,399
google it

332
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,800
okay

333
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,920
we have all played ctf all upset guys so

334
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,480
we understand what it is

335
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,160
in the i.t environment everybody

336
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,440
understands

337
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,279
what the idea

338
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,880
is

339
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,160
you can also have task based ctf which

340
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,519
is

341
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,680
easier

342
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,079
you can

343
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,240
spend more time we have the city of

344
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,839
platforms and tasks so you can build a

345
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,880
ctf for your team using some ready made

346
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,760
pieces so if they are

347
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,240
not very seasoned city of players they

348
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,560
are not likely to have seen it before so

349
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,240
in 2021

350
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,760
and 22 we had two ctfs

351
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,839
one was

352
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,959
called stein star mir so we couldn't and

353
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,519
we also had the spy net

354
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,639
ctf

355
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,880
so these are two

356
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,320
topical ctfs

357
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,839
a few words about

358
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,880
the topics so the topics

359
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,279
are more as clear so this is about web

360
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,680
reverse crypto pps admin network

361
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,399
forensic trivia

362
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,399
why

363
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,519
it's not because we have all these

364
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,399
fields

365
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,959
in-house

366
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,880
well we had to sacrifice um what we had

367
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,079
i don't have many people doing the evs

368
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,760
but those who

369
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,320
do everything quickly so we needed to a

370
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,680
couple of uh

371
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,000
more consuming tasks for them

372
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,079
and uh this is more or less clear for

373
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,040
every ctf player

374
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,560
oh okay

375
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,599
the contents

376
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,279
we had one topic for everything i

377
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,279
believe if you look at sendoff you

378
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,680
clearly understand why all these

379
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,760
gamifications should have one topic when

380
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,199
you have one topic this becomes a game

381
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,320
and one is just a set of

382
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,880
tasks scattered around now one is going

383
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,199
to get excited

384
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,000
and it's not exactly playing games so

385
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,079
the idea is to train people that's why

386
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,480
all the tasks we

387
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,920
developed were developed in our own

388
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,959
technological stack and we're using the

389
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,880
vulnerabilities we

390
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,600
bump into all the time so if you take a

391
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,079
vulnerability if you exploit it and if

392
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,480
you understand what the issue

393
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,199
is about you are not going to

394
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,040
make this error again so this is well as

395
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,480
good as it gets

396
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,320
and well

397
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,320
i believe that another important thing

398
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,320
is that the task should be performed

399
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,199
without any uh dedicated software the

400
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,880
city of guys they have all the software

401
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,480
and those who do it for the first time

402
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,600
should use

403
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,480
some makeshift arrangements for this

404
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,680
another important thing is the great of

405
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,519
difficulty

406
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,320
well we do something for the first time

407
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,040
people don't understand what it is

408
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,720
so the important thing is to be able to

409
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,079
start so if you start doing something

410
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,720
you'll be more engaged and if you cannot

411
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,440
do anything you can just drop it that's

412
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,279
how the first 30 percent

413
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,680
of tasks were very

414
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,920
easy you could google them so they're

415
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,519
interesting but still straightforward so

416
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,440
those who go to the platform

417
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,639
they

418
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,360
have made some progress and they've been

419
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,000
ranked and so this way

420
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
it

421
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,519
had them stuck

422
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,480
and

423
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,399
and some of the tasks were 40 were

424
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,360
average

425
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,280
in terms of complexity and 30 percent

426
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,160
were

427
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,400
more complex or difficult so in the

428
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,520
first 70 percent we had the major

429
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,439
learning tasks

430
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,559
not necessarily in this difficult ones

431
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,199
okay some interesting things we had

432
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,559
dynamic scores so the task wasn't uh

433
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,599
enough pre-scored

434
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,439
i mean the more

435
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,319
people

436
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,240
solve the problem

437
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,600
the fewer points you could get for that

438
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,840
so we didn't want to have any false

439
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,679
finish so you couldn't

440
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,120
solve the problem too quickly

441
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,919
and

442
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,000
the first time we didn't know how many

443
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,120
tasks we needed that's why we had

444
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,679
something more in store when we saw that

445
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,200
people started solving very quickly we

446
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,120
just added more tasks

447
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,520
and i believe that's fine and

448
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,840
the second cdf we overplayed it

449
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,600
so we had to give people

450
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,520
hints the important thing is that

451
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,000
everything

452
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,360
should be

453
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,320
solved by at least one guy now let uh

454
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,559
share with you

455
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,200
an anecdote on the honeypot okay we have

456
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,000
a ctf for it guys based on our own

457
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,760
infrastructure

458
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,039
and

459
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,720
there we have

460
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,720
administrators who have full access

461
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,720
everywhere and we have

462
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,960
platforms with the database and with all

463
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,039
the answers

464
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:35,919
okay

465
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,919
we have monitored

466
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,120
all the

467
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,039
access things but if you have the server

468
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,559
root it's difficult to

469
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,720
fight with it so

470
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,160
we had

471
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,960
a heavy task and there is a guy

472
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,679
who is kind of solving these tasks and

473
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,039
so on but there was one problem the task

474
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,080
wasn't

475
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,640
cut off so there wasn't any solution to

476
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,039
the task so the only way to

477
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,679
solve the problem was to get the answer

478
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,000
from the base so we we interviewed the

479
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,559
guy asked how he was doing it

480
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,240
he

481
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,320
gave us the right solution which would

482
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,320
generate a wrong result so we

483
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,120
disqualified this guide so we had the

484
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,200
honeypot so that we

485
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,360
can catch these guys and the next year

486
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,520
we had good monitoring there was one guy

487
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,760
who was trying to raise logs but we

488
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,360
still found him

489
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,360
so we got him flying

490
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,600
so we need to understand these things

491
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,480
since people differ and they play in

492
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,280
different styles

493
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,320
okay

494
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,559
it's important to start on a friday

495
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,799
because the technical experts

496
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,060
they spent uh

497
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,640
[Music]

498
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,760
weekends and uh evenings so that's for

499
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,679
the technical guys because they work on

500
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,679
the work days and we should need at

501
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,280
least one

502
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,760
week sometimes even two that's like in

503
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,440
our case because some people are busy so

504
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,760
they always wanted the announcement to

505
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,919
be made beforehand so that people can

506
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,600
carry out some time

507
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,280
to participate

508
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,840
we had

509
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,039
so we always have uh good uh

510
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,919
awards and uh this is really cool so we

511
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,400
never announced them beforehand

512
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,640
so this is a very good positive

513
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,080
way to

514
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,880
motivate people well support is clear

515
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,480
and we monitored their activities in

516
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,840
both games

517
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,080
and

518
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,600
based on their activities you can easily

519
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,200
understand whether people

520
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,120
solve the problems of their own or not

521
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,480
and we also get

522
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,200
feedback on any event so we draw

523
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,360
conclusions and try to improve things

524
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,559
okay that's the way it is it's clear for

525
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,799
the technical experts we're not the

526
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,600
first company to do it so it is more or

527
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,600
less clear

528
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,158
last year

529
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,880
a colleague from the security department

530
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,960
came to us and said we want ctf for

531
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,080
business

532
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,720
and we said how and he said okay ctf for

533
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,600
business

534
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,080
and the question was what can they do

535
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,720
and then he shared his idea with us

536
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,880
and

537
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,000
it looked nice then i thought about it

538
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,120
and

539
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,840
that's the question why everything we do

540
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,919
in business education

541
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,600
is so boring

542
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,240
well so how they do it you take the

543
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,880
regulations

544
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,480
well this is e-learning that's why

545
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,240
we split it into

546
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,080
small pieces with some

547
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,840
answer options and then to make it more

548
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,520
interesting you add a picture there

549
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,840
well i don't know i believe it's the

550
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,520
most boring thing

551
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,799
to

552
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,559
click the tests

553
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,440
to see how long should be the password

554
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,720
of your neighbor for instance

555
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,200
hence the idea

556
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,360
let's make it different let's make it

557
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,520
cool

558
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,240
okay how did we start i started putting

559
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,480
it on the whiteboard what we want the

560
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,799
business people to avoid doing okay we

561
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:25,679
don't

562
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,360
want them to share their passwords with

563
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,600
anyone we don't want the passwords to be

564
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,080
put on paper we don't want

565
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,240
the table

566
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,799
like left unlocked we don't want them to

567
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:37,679
follow

568
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,679
phishing

569
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,440
and uh so they don't publish personal

570
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,039
information and so on so forth so many

571
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,559
things we want them to do

572
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,559
kind of a wish list and then we thought

573
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,240
okay what are these what are the things

574
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,679
we can convert

575
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,559
into problems to be solved because

576
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,559
sometimes well we cannot test things

577
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,799
and as a result

578
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,960
we developed a standalone

579
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,280
game

580
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,440
okay yeah

581
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
so many reasons

582
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,520
and this was called spy club game

583
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,720
everything

584
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,679
was done in one style and for the

585
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,120
business people this is even more

586
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,360
important for the technical guys this

587
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,320
legends are fine but here

588
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,840
we had texts

589
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,159
ready for every

590
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,000
task and every problem

591
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,159
and we had a topical awards

592
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,799
three topics ascend

593
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:43,679
simple security and decollete data links

594
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,880
okay it's clear in terms of data leak

595
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,919
i believe that the biggest pain is when

596
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,240
the business people just don't uh think

597
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,600
about uh

598
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,919
this so they can

599
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:00,960
just

600
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,120
leave information anywhere so they don't

601
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,039
understand that if you do things online

602
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,400
they can leak

603
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,080
or they send to instagram just whatever

604
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,679
okay ascent

605
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:12,799
well

606
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,559
we wanted to

607
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,640
show how much information could be

608
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,320
obtained

609
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,320
from open sources we wanted them to do

610
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,559
this so that the next time they should

611
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,640
be surprised that the

612
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,240
bad guys know this

613
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,400
and the simple security this is about

614
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,520
problems like to have or to crack an

615
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,240
archive with some weak passwords

616
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,159
okay

617
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,799
organization

618
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,520
okay they

619
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,760
they used the notepad

620
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,279
the mouse

621
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,799
and the keyboard

622
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,159
so for them the environment can be

623
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,240
reduced and the internet resources they

624
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,159
were pretty much

625
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,200
standard

626
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,240
and timing was shorter well for

627
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,080
technical city elsewhere for two weeks

628
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,080
and the business city of saw the first

629
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,559
uh guy so we had it once

630
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:05,440
uh

631
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,360
solved all the problems

632
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,760
at three o'clock in the morning that the

633
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,919
next day after the start

634
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,559
and uh he was looking through his

635
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,480
working day then the whole evening and

636
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,480
the whole night so he solved all the

637
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,159
problems and uh relaxed

638
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,679
so

639
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:24,799
maybe

640
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,240
well this guy's uh i'm a more persistent

641
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,159
so they work without any breaks

642
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,400
some interesting approaches here

643
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,360
every problem was for learning

644
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,679
we had an archive with the password

645
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,840
which would be from one to eight and

646
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,440
just um

647
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,679
had to guess it it wasn't just an

648
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,120
archive for the password we had a kind

649
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,360
of a legend that this archive was stolen

650
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,240
because

651
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,000
somebody put it

652
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,360
on the

653
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,400
memory stick and lost it so i mean the

654
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,360
source

655
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,640
of the task was also a good practice so

656
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,640
the people should read this and think

657
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,360
okay things like that shouldn't be done

658
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,400
here is

659
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,360
what it can lead to

660
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,840
well it's important that we

661
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,679
shouldn't have

662
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,760
our problems like

663
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,000
difficult passwords and so on but we had

664
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,440
a game

665
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,200
and there were several

666
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,600
problems which didn't relate to our

667
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,799
routine

668
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,520
like the book

669
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,240
encryption or coding but this is just an

670
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,159
instant

671
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,240
thing so we just added it there to

672
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,960
balance it out

673
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,240
an important thing the difference

674
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,760
between the business people and the

675
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,679
technical people the business people had

676
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:48,480
this

677
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,080
dynamic like that

678
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,559
so one people

679
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,640
saw the problem everybody

680
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,360
was solving the problem at the same time

681
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,159
so people were sharing but i believe we

682
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,120
can give scores for solving the problem

683
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,559
to help people

684
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,520
and

685
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,159
we had the support chat and when

686
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,400
people couldn't solve problems

687
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,360
there they sent interesting articles and

688
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,640
people

689
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,200
educated themselves because they needed

690
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,039
this information to solve the problem so

691
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,559
i believe this is

692
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,039
useful

693
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,158
some examples

694
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,320
the history of the browser

695
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,679
was

696
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,600
to be used to find

697
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,200
their website

698
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,039
which caused the leakage so with the url

699
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,720
which is fraudulent or the books

700
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,480
encryption so they should find the book

701
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,640
and they should you understand that this

702
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,080
is

703
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,080
encrypted and they need to solve the

704
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,919
problem another interesting

705
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,320
problem

706
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,760
tickets

707
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,559
well i would say that uh publishing your

708
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,600
tickets is the best is a bad practice

709
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,720
and the

710
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,720
codes you know when i

711
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,799
went to this uh code so you have the

712
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,640
book and number and you can use it to

713
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,720
cancel the flight

714
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,720
or move people closer to the toilet

715
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,200
whichever you prefer well anyway

716
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,520
the idea was to find out

717
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,480
the

718
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,240
name of the person

719
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,399
so when you do it once you will never

720
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:28,760
publish your ticket anywhere

721
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,919
another problem

722
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,200
i can

723
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,159
find out some

724
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:37,679
features of the document for instance

725
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,679
the author of the document

726
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,000
or we have several passwords from

727
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,399
various services but they

728
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,480
are alike and you can guess the rest of

729
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,240
the password based on this

730
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,240
so this uh

731
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,559
simple task or problems they are simple

732
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,559
to us the security guys the technical

733
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,000
guys but

734
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,960
the guys for the guys from business this

735
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,440
is far from being easy

736
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,039
and at that time

737
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,159
they're building the neural networks

738
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:07,679
they understand okay that this pattern

739
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,520
of passwords isn't good

740
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,520
and i believe this is exactly the goal

741
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,000
of training

742
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,880
okay what makes ctf cool why should you

743
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,640
do it

744
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,200
number one for the participants

745
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,760
they believe that ctf is not about

746
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,640
training for them it's time building and

747
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,480
uh kind of situation where they can

748
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,679
spend time well some of them thought

749
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,120
that

750
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,960
our hr department uh arranges quests and

751
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,600
other events like that so many of them

752
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,399
thought

753
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,039
that this is just the same thing just

754
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,799
a quest

755
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:49,360
and it turned out to be a security quest

756
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,679
and another pleasant thing is that they

757
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:54,399
get

758
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,200
prizes for organizers

759
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,640
it is clear that we teach them security

760
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,799
in a kind of tender and nice way

761
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,640
and speaking of technical ctf another

762
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,120
important thing is that if you believe

763
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,279
in security champion

764
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,120
champions

765
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,360
the best way to pick security champions

766
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,000
is to have a ctf

767
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,039
so whoever is most active in a support

768
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,240
chat

769
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,279
you

770
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,159
get him and you give them interesting

771
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,000
articles and this is your

772
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,520
pool of potential security champions

773
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,320
so ctf improves security culture people

774
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,000
would come to me with feedback saying

775
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,039
that it's great that it's done this way

776
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,840
and it's so much fun

777
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,360
for those who organizes ctfs

778
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,440
because you know when you just do

779
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,760
testing it's one thing it's pretty

780
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,840
boring and when you have to write tasks

781
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,720
and

782
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,799
look at the responses

783
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,880
it's really fun

784
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,360
and obviously i want to

785
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,279
brag a little bit what we're going to do

786
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:09,039
next and of may we would like to uh try

787
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,960
in person offline ctf i think it's

788
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,640
i think it's great

789
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,840
but it's

790
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,760
rather difficult to

791
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,640
get

792
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,480
the people

793
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,240
you have to have a day

794
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,559
allocated for it

795
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:30,600
and i'll tell you if it works

796
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,720
and

797
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,360
try not to just train people because

798
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,600
they're supposed to be trained trying to

799
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,719
try to measure certain metrics kpis

800
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,360
and use it

801
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,919
if this is what they're lacking if this

802
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,840
type of knowledge is lacking that's what

803
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,360
you should they

804
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,679
train them on so that would be all thank

805
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:56,960
you very much i'll be able to take your

806
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,960
questions

807
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,159
thank you for this presentation

808
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,039
uh how about after you had business ctf

809
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:17,039
did you have any feedback saying that

810
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,399
they would like to participate in

811
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:19,840
technical cdf

812
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,320
no there's an abyss between them but

813
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,039
between these two activities uh the

814
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:29,799
business and the technical ctf

815
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,600
in business ctf

816
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,799
it is so light it is it is so

817
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:39,679
you know

818
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,919
high level

819
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,679
and we didn't even inform the business

820
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,279
guys about technical cds and vice versa

821
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,720
i mean i'm not sure they even know they

822
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,720
exist

823
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,440
thank you thank you very much for this

824
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,279
presentation i i

825
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,200
i did something similar

826
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,240
but my major challenge was that even the

827
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,120
developers

828
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,559
opened the ctf how do you motivate the

829
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,240
technical guys the developers to

830
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,200
participate our prices were not

831
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,200
happen to be not motivating enough looks

832
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,960
like

833
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,840
and also did you try to organize a ctf

834
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,640
where

835
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,159
there's team against another team and

836
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,200
there are team leaders and they

837
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,640
they combat online and

838
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,399
let me start by answering the second

839
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:41,919
question we were asked to do something

840
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,399
like that we are thinking about it

841
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,480
we're going to have a tank defense we'll

842
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,080
see how it works

843
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,559
working in teams i think it's cool

844
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:51,679
actually

845
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,480
team ctf uh would allow you to resolve

846
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,000
the issue that you asked in your first

847
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,120
question in every team there is this uh

848
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,360
there are the active guys

849
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,240
and if you wish to get a team

850
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,320
out of your developers this active guy

851
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,639
would drag in some other guys because

852
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,199
he's so charismatic so they would just

853
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,239
follow

854
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,960
because he is he would drag them in

855
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,480
um i can't say

856
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,119
we have problems attracting developers

857
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,040
and you you have to realize yes indeed

858
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,839
they are busy they're not all of them

859
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,918
not all of them are interested while we

860
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:34,320
try to

861
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,679
you know spur them somehow and

862
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,280
attract them another question then

863
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,679
for ctf it is important to go through

864
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,240
the first stage

865
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:54,480
like uh do do what i do right

866
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,520
yeah well we did that we did that

867
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,839
and we tried a lot of various approaches

868
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,599
to how to make it work

869
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,800
we test security we want to just

870
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,880
sit back and do nothing and you we

871
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,839
thought that if they

872
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:17,359
uh there are no bugs coming from them

873
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,599
then we should keep quiet but then we

874
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,839
started to think okay and

875
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,960
how what do we do for them to prevent

876
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,280
bugs

877
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,560
and we can't use no code no bug approach

878
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,680
right

879
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,760
first we did our internal training by

880
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,240
means of lectures then we had our

881
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,240
mailings then we described our best

882
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,680
practices

883
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,240
but little by little it turned out that

884
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,280
the best effect comes from gamifications

885
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,960
ctf that is

886
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,240
but the things that i mentioned

887
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,560
you know ctf does not abolish the

888
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,920
regulatory documents

889
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,000
and the other stuff cdf is something

890
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,240
they like but it doesn't mean that we

891
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,119
don't uh need anything else thank you

892
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,000
i'm here right um thank you for this

893
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,440
presentation

894
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,040
in the beginning of your presentation

895
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,000
you

896
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,079
looked at

897
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,200
these questions i don't want to i don't

898
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,680
i can't do it and i don't know

899
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,599
but sometimes developers

900
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,280
really can't

901
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,560
so my question is about this

902
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,800
if you look at smallish companies like

903
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,119
startups for example

904
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,000
where there is a small team that

905
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,560
has financial constraints and resource

906
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,920
constraints

907
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,119
and they definitely don't have time

908
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,760
would it count as they count rather than

909
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,320
they don't want to or they have releases

910
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,520
once per month and they don't have time

911
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,720
to to

912
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,359
develop a secure code now i mentioned

913
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:55,359
secure code now you're saying a ctf is a

914
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,400
way out yeah sure

915
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,920
what would be an option for a team

916
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,599
that is very limited in terms of

917
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,480
resources and time

918
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,320
while you you would have to hunt the

919
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,160
market for people who are experienced

920
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,320
enough if you are you are resource

921
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,839
limited

922
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,400
you want to single out one person and

923
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,200
call it security champion

924
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,880
give him the black

925
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,839
page or hoodie even better

926
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,680
and let

927
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,040
him go

928
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,359
to the courses and then be in charge

929
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,760
obviously he is going to do it

930
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,200
in small bits

931
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,880
but the general

932
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,920
level will go up anyway

933
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,320
have you looked into an opportunity of

934
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,440
having a ctf

935
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,160
so you mentioned a mentor you you train

936
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,839
the mentor and then the man to train

937
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,040
somebody else

938
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,880
and pass the knowledge

939
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,359
onward

940
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,880
and then probably

941
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,240
after ctf he passes the

942
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,680
information on

943
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,640
indeed indeed

944
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,440
so

945
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,640
developers know how to do high load of

946
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,359
software they know how to do software

947
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,280
that performs all kinds of functions but

948
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,119
not security functions and at this point

949
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,680
they say oh no we don't know that

950
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,320
it's it's it doesn't work this way i

951
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,040
think it's just uh making excuse they

952
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,800
know it

953
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,760
if you

954
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,839
if you need you probably want to train

955
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:40,240
one person somewhat better in in

956
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,599
security

957
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:47,079
for for a kind of uh four perk

958
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,079
hi

959
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,240
uh we also

960
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,040
use ctfs great i i totally share your

961
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,680
point of view but we have this issue so

962
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,440
i'm interested if you encounter it as

963
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,480
well

964
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,040
the expertise level of those who

965
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,960
participate differs

966
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,119
some people participate and several c

967
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,920
have participated in several ctfs others

968
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,720
are first-timers so the ones we want to

969
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,560
train are in the bottom of the rating

970
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,079
they don't have any chance of getting

971
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,800
the price and they are demotivated and

972
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,440
the ones who actually um

973
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,599
know everything better than us and they

974
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,920
know how these tasks work they

975
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,240
keep getting all the prizes and it would

976
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,599
be

977
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,920
weird to exclude them right

978
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,480
because it's it it seems unfair you know

979
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,720
you kind of punish for their knowledge

980
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,839
but then

981
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,480
shall we split them into leagues

982
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,400
how about uh how about you did you have

983
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,440
this issue oh what a cool question we do

984
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,440
have this layering factor as well

985
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,280
but again um

986
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,079
it

987
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,160
doesn't seem to demotivate

988
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,440
the the cool guys get

989
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,640
extra complicated tasks

990
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,240
if you get 90 percent

991
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,119
and then it takes him two weeks to

992
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,160
do the

993
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,079
last 10 percent it would be great

994
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,200
because it would motivate the rest to

995
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,960
fight through the 90 percent right

996
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,720
so we we increase

997
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,760
and i don't see any things like i don't

998
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,839
want to play because i'm not going to be

999
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,760
the winner

1000
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,280
right good idea thank you

1001
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,119
alexey thank you for i'm here thank you

1002
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,880
for this presentation my question is

1003
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,400
this

1004
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,160
ctf stands a text text cts was it this

1005
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,960
instead synthetic infrastructure or you

1006
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,440
would take code written by

1007
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,200
your

1008
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,800
coders

1009
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,040
and uh already known bugs

1010
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,359
so that colleagues identify those bugs

1011
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,200
where they should have done

1012
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,040
better and kind of train on their own

1013
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,400
mistakes

1014
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,480
so as to know how to make it right no no

1015
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,440
no we are we were writing from scratch

1016
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,680
but would use the type of bags that we

1017
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,599
did encounter now through to life

1018
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:10,560
practice

1019
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,079
it's much easier than to take a

1020
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:14,880
uh

1021
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,480
an existing product and and then

1022
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,359
find the bugs and then use it and input

1023
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:22,880
an answer into it

1024
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,280
it's easier to take the box that you

1025
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,520
know

1026
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,760
and then um

1027
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,280
put it into your new code i have a

1028
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,560
question

1029
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,119
you mentioned

1030
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,319
you had the revised engineering tasks

1031
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:43,920
quite complicated

1032
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,720
and probably

1033
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,760
they had to use certain uh tools but

1034
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,680
they cannot differentiate the good tool

1035
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,760
from a bad tool right

1036
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,640
in our case people would a clothes

1037
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,119
inspire repositories

1038
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,800
you know how to de-risk

1039
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,240
because he would uh work on ctf and at

1040
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,440
this time

1041
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,000
and at the same time introduce a malware

1042
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,920
well it can't happen

1043
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:17,079
with us but we did have this question

1044
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,520
and this was for reverse engineering

1045
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,280
those who would go

1046
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,240
to

1047
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,480
the reverse engineering they were using

1048
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:33,599
their devices their own personal devices

1049
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,359
and sometimes we just prompted them

1050
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:39,680
these are the software that you could

1051
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,000
use oh you prompted them right you kind

1052
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,720
of it kind of guided ctf

1053
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,680
wow

1054
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,078
you know

1055
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,119
we we support them

1056
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,800
if you see that

1057
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,720
they're it's taking them too long we

1058
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,280
kind of prompt them because otherwise

1059
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,280
it's too boring

1060
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,839
if you keep you know banging your head

1061
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,440
against the wall and it

1062
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,359
it it doesn't work then it's it's

1063
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:09,280
demotivating so

1064
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,200
we kind of

1065
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,839
feed them on prompts a little bit so so

1066
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:16,960
as to keep their interest

1067
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,480
the mic is coming please wait

1068
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,400
good day thank you

1069
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,079
so my question is this

1070
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:40,119
so you had

1071
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,560
you had this ctf

1072
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,960
and you did everything

1073
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,680
to

1074
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,839
train the business and the developers

1075
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,920
so did it help did it did it turn on the

1076
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,200
next uh

1077
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,160
release that you did

1078
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,480
i mean did you have an exhaust

1079
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,200
well we can't give you it in numbers

1080
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,599
like 17 better

1081
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,920
subjectively yes we feel it yes

1082
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,800
when starts to see less backs

1083
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,160
it means that

1084
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,440
it works

1085
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,520
and we look at the progress

1086
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,599
it's you know saying is that

1087
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,680
at our maturity level the developers

1088
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,079
don't uh

1089
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:38,800
get the bags that can be caught by fast

1090
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,040
some other things like logic logical uh

1091
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,040
errors etc this is something that we

1092
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,720
love to do manually

1093
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,720
we want to get rid of the simple bugs

1094
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,160
and if this is used as our kpi then we

1095
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,680
can see the improvement but it's

1096
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,520
difficult to understand to understand

1097
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,200
whether it's purely done saying

1098
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,960
whether it happens purely thanks to the

1099
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,920
ctf or not

1100
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,359
another point is that we have certain

1101
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,359
churn of

1102
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:21,200
stuff

1103
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,640
another

1104
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,720
kpi you want to follow

1105
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,079
is uh how more often than you the

1106
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:29,760
newcomers

1107
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,000
put bugs into the software as compared

1108
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,880
to the old guys

1109
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,960
not that we have enough data to

1110
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,880
calculate this metrics precisely but

1111
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,560
we try to follow it all

1112
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,960
and we'll look at these metric

1113
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,599
matrix

1114
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,680
but not to the extent as to do

1115
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:00,279
everything on the basis of this matrix

1116
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,599
yes it has become better but

1117
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,640
i can't give you percentages percentage

1118
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,920
numbers

1119
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,440
thank you

1120
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,560
uh my question is this

1121
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,359
say there is an abyss between

1122
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:21,359
a security guys and the developers

1123
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:24,480
do you think this kind of

1124
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,200
ctfs do don't you think it would create

1125
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,599
even a bigger gap

1126
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:32,400
say the i.t guys

1127
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,200
resolved these i mean the business guys

1128
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,200
resolved simple tasks and they thought

1129
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,599
okay that's easy

1130
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,720
and their conclusion might be oh you

1131
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,720
don't we don't need you guys your

1132
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,359
technical guys because uh it works for

1133
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,599
us we can do it on their own i don't

1134
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,079
think so

1135
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:58,000
you know what i'm saying um probably

1136
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,240
you want to redistribute the tasks in

1137
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,800
such a way

1138
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,200
but if they resolved 20

1139
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,440
of obvious tasks and they say

1140
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,000
uh we can do it on our own and then i

1141
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,079
would ask them to resolve the rest of

1142
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,839
the tasks

1143
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:18,720
our complexity increases very gradually

1144
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,040
and you could clearly see it's in in the

1145
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,720
first hour they would resolve a lot of

1146
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:27,839
stuff and then

1147
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,079
slow down and there was no such

1148
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:31,760
instances when people would say that

1149
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,480
it's too easy we don't understand what

1150
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,160
security guys are doing because it's so

1151
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,200
easy

1152
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,440
no it doesn't work this way

1153
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,280
and everybody's happy

1154
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,880
and the abbots didn't

1155
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,240
increase

1156
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,359
probably didn't have one

1157
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,319
i can see another question in the first

1158
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,839
row on the

1159
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:56,640
on my left

1160
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,160
hi thanks for this presentation

1161
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,359
i'm curious to know

1162
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:08,960
when you started

1163
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,000
uh

1164
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,720
team ctf and the it guy cdf

1165
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,480
how about

1166
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,559
uh giving them

1167
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:19,200
an experienced security guy

1168
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,920
as a special mentor

1169
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,520
a leader

1170
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,240
wow that's a great idea if you have such

1171
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,559
an opportunity

1172
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,800
if you have enough of experts of this

1173
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,319
kind that would be really great

1174
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,440
i think it's a brilliant idea i'll write

1175
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,760
it down

1176
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,960
you really

1177
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,599
i need to understand that this guy

1178
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:50,480
should

1179
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,640
not just understand security but also

1180
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,359
understand the ctf

1181
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:58,400
when you build when you do defense and

1182
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,280
ctf you don't really understand what

1183
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,960
what needs to be done and this kind of

1184
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,160
mentor

1185
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,640
could be helpful

1186
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:10,319
what we did we did pre-training

1187
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:14,800
with them we did the demos and all that

1188
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,839
so that people don't start from scratch

1189
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:19,839
because we don't have enough of experts

1190
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:21,760
of this kind to

1191
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,800
uh to put some uh you know to use as

1192
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,280
sort of mantras but i loved i love your

1193
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,559
idea

1194
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:31,680
uh time is up and please speak best

1195
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:32,640
question

1196
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,599
i loved little this uh uh last question

1197
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:37,119
because this is

1198
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:39,520
uh this would be my pet idea

1199
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,440
not because i only remember the last

1200
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,200
