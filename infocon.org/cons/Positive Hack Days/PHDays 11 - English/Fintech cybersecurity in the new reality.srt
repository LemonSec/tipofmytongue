1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,000
we continue with the financial sector

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
cyber security we'll speak with alexey

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,759
eugene right security director

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,680
in the beginning can you share with us

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,359
your impressions and feelings

6
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,599
how you as a representative of fintech

7
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,599
industry how did you feel

8
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,640
new realities in recent months

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,000
have any changes happen to you

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,559
of course they did happen

11
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,959
a lot of

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,680
negative moments had to be overcome

13
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,640
we use

14
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,600
foreign software as well

15
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,199
we use foreign services as well

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,840
and in number of cases

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,920
some services are being outdated

18
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,119
so we have to replace them we have to

19
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,280
change them

20
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,040
by piloting other solutions

21
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,439
so we improve our system and we are

22
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,758
searching for plan b plan c

23
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,200
there are things which continue working

24
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,600
irrespectively to

25
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,000
situation while they will continue

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,920
working without a license but it's not

27
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,479
desirable

28
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,840
we are going through a temporary

29
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,840
transition but some products have to be

30
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,399
replaced immediately

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,160
i cannot tell you about number and names

32
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,239
but is there any difference according to

33
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,959
your opinion between

34
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,120
different industries right now like

35
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,200
fintech because it's much more difficult

36
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,959
for them or maybe fintech is not as

37
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,480
difficult as other industries

38
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,000
well honestly speaking

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,599
yes

40
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,680
it's hard to speak

41
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,920
about different industries it's just

42
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,238
that fintech uses

43
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,519
some advanced products and services and

44
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,800
there's big number of them

45
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,599
some services have no analogies or they

46
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,879
are of bad level and bad quality

47
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,640
from the point of view of the load they

48
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,560
are not able to keep it from the fintech

49
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,319
point of view

50
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,319
there are high requirements on

51
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,159
sustainability and resilience and big

52
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,959
volumes of data that can be processed

53
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,519
by them

54
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,720
not all russian solutions can boast with

55
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,040
all these

56
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,720
are there any new possibilities which

57
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,879
are being disclosed by the theme tech

58
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,159
and companies

59
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,958
after

60
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,040
it's hard to say which advantages can

61
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,400
happen

62
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,760
because it happened very suddenly

63
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,080
not many people thought that it's going

64
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,920
to happen and not many people thought

65
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,159
that

66
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,879
it will immediately disconnect us from

67
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,319
the rest of the world and big number of

68
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,040
solutions will be

69
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,720
disconnected this moment of time it's

70
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,159
very hard to speak about advantages

71
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,400
there was nothing like resolutions

72
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,840
looking like advantages the previous

73
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,319
story with creamier

74
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,200
have shown us that yes

75
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,320
there will be certain blockages

76
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,918
but they've connected them back and

77
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,358
everybody started to work and they

78
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,040
thought that something like that will

79
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,600
happen again

80
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,400
this risk

81
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
but right now situation has changed

82
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,080
significantly and the market is changing

83
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,800
significantly

84
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,919
yes we are looking at new solutions we

85
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,600
have extended the horizon from the point

86
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,680
of view of understanding

87
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,320
however we need time we need additional

88
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,880
resources for the analysis for testing

89
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,560
for tuning up these solutions for

90
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,520
ourselves one thing is when you do it in

91
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,759
a simple mode when you decided to

92
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,440
replace one solution by another solution

93
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,639
but another thing is when

94
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,440
you're running running running

95
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,280
in all directions simultaneously okay

96
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,880
let's think about the software with the

97
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,759
open source code

98
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,039
[Music]

99
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,880
yes we use it we have our own software

100
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,800
in-house developments we use some

101
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,960
proprietary solutions open source

102
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,840
solutions

103
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,080
i perceive them very positively

104
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,360
of course we

105
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,800
use uh well-tested storage because not

106
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,880
all open source solutions are the best

107
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,840
solutions

108
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,520
there was a comprehension of libraries

109
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,919
and compromising of the market

110
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,759
and approached the open source solutions

111
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,039
by the number of authors have applied

112
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,600
changes bad changes

113
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,840
in recent libraries

114
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,159
and it has negatively influenced

115
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,520
the availability of the open source

116
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,360
solutions what do you mean by negative

117
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,080
injections

118
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,960
negative injections well just recently

119
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,440
in march

120
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,520
we've been collecting information from

121
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,360
chats we've been looking at specialists

122
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,800
and technical directors and

123
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,800
security specialists we've been

124
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,440
collecting open source libraries whose

125
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,319
authors have been introducing malicious

126
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,759
changes

127
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,120
in their

128
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,120
source code and been publishing it in

129
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,120
new releases and as a result it happened

130
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,280
that

131
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,880
this software has been working in

132
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,759
russian companies russian ap addresses

133
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,240
or with localization.areu

134
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,720
in some companies sites

135
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,400
stopped operating in some other

136
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,199
companies something went really wrong

137
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,680
and some of their systems have been shut

138
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,639
down in number of other cases these were

139
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,840
small

140
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,039
but not really nice statements for

141
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,280
example obscene language statements and

142
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,080
notifications

143
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,680
something like glory to ukraine or

144
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,319
something like that

145
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,039
was a big part of source code

146
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,039
used by these injections

147
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,199
the list was several dozens maybe maybe

148
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,560
a hundred

149
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,840
of components and libraries but because

150
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,879
every library

151
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,120
is connected to another one it's very

152
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,479
difficult to discover

153
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,160
so they're all open source software it's

154
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,919
very difficult to search for

155
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,840
dependencies what depends from what

156
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,440
but it was the fact of life that if

157
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,879
previously

158
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,800
open source software was checked

159
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,840
right now open source software has to be

160
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,599
has to go through

161
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,039
triple check

162
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,599
and code validation

163
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,039
and update of this software update of

164
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,760
the components deployment of owned

165
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,718
repositories

166
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,040
so the degree of schizophrenia has grown

167
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,600
plans to increase the volume

168
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
in your infrastructure the volume of the

169
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,600
open source software or maybe your own

170
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,240
developments compared to what you've had

171
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,320
last year or what

172
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,399
no

173
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,440
hard to say yes we are switching to

174
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,399
some

175
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,720
russian services those which are

176
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,640
available and those which make us happy

177
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,439
function wise

178
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,000
from the point of view of open source

179
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,320
software we are going to look at it and

180
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,080
mostly this is related to i.t

181
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,519
information security

182
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,839
so we did have incident oil and gas

183
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,560
company tube was attacked by hakkas i

184
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,959
see red lamps are blinking and the

185
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,600
information about the distribution of

186
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,399
malicious encoding virus in the oil gas

187
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,640
company tube these companies involved in

188
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,360
production processing storage and sales

189
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,279
of oil and gas

190
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,360
this is the recent event which happened

191
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,839
just now

192
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,680
and i see the counter of inadmissible

193
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,800
events which happened in these uh and

194
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,440
it's approximately 15 of them

195
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,399
so we're speaking they're breaking

196
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,079
speaking they're hiking okay continuing

197
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,000
our conversation oh something else

198
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,120
happened

199
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,560
they're not allowing us to speak

200
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,920
this time it's

201
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,320
another encoder in the same place let's

202
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,640
move on

203
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,920
can a state

204
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,240
or support transfer to the open source

205
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,399
or usage of your own software

206
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,680
of course the state can do that and

207
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,239
ideally it should happen like that

208
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,760
one of the options

209
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,959
and this is something that is being

210
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,519
discussed in the market is bringing

211
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,240
fintech companies and banks

212
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,330
to i.t company status

213
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:04,079
[Music]

214
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,839
which is not happening right now

215
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,200
unfortunately it's not helping

216
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,760
any development and increasing the

217
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,680
number of developers and programmers

218
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,240
from one side

219
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,200
from the other side

220
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,279
certain set of measures which are

221
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,760
state irrespectively to announcements

222
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,000
that we need to help companies in

223
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,079
difficult days

224
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,040
we see that

225
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,760
we see bigger number of non-planned uh

226
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,720
checkups of companies and instead of

227
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,680
help more often we get additional

228
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,880
legislative and regulative control

229
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,639
additional control in addition to what

230
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,079
was happening

231
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,480
it's not easy for companies right now

232
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,240
and right now they're being pressed even

233
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,480
more

234
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,160
so our regulators are pressing us from

235
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,880
all the sides

236
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,800
so most likely at a given moment of time

237
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,720
you don't feel any state support

238
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,720
unfortunately not

239
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,680
unfortunately not

240
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,519
and i don't see any bright future

241
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,399
i don't see any assistance in this part

242
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,720
mandatory import substitution

243
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,600
doesn't work

244
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,839
or it works in the wrong way

245
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,000
how would you see that

246
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,840
well honestly speaking

247
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,279
[Music]

248
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,600
there was a good program on the side of

249
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,560
the ministry of trade it was the program

250
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,920
of grants

251
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,800
provided to young companies involved in

252
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,000
i.t sectors

253
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,839
or in the sector of development of

254
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,240
certain

255
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,360
machine vision systems machine learning

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,760
systems biometrical systems etc

257
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,880
these were end-to-end technologies

258
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,440
unfortunately

259
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,279
this grant provisioning was aimed

260
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,600
at the moment when you already have

261
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,920
basic 18 infrastructure

262
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,800
and basic set of products

263
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,920
but as we could see it from the

264
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,920
experience

265
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,880

data storage servers

270
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,000
and without all of these

271
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,800
without the basis we cannot move forward

272
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,399
and we have not been able to replace

273
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,920
and we have not been able to see the

274
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,440
support

275
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,360

elementary base

277
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,920
radio electronics we don't have any

278
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,040
substitution and in it or it products we

279
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,839
also didn't see any substitution and all

280
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,320
available products that we had and all

281
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,079
developed products and they are

282
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,079
developed by commercial companies

283
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,600
without help of our state

284
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,480
and even against it

285
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,600
okay let's speak about providing

286
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,680
security to services provided by kiwi

287
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,920
um

288
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,680
you have conducted an exercise like

289
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,480
hacker one participated in your program

290
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,560
to provide penetration of your services

291
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,360
pen testing your services that's right

292
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,360
we did have a contract

293
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,000
with hacker one

294
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,040
and they've been pen testing

295
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,120
basically it was a

296
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,199
bad bouncy program to search for

297
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,360
vulnerabilities we've been paying

298
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,639
bounty

299
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,360
to

300
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,920
independent researchers they've been

301
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,639
delivering us a big number

302
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,560
of bugs

303
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,440
and discoveries we have been fixing them

304
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,639
sap

305
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,120
so from this point of view

306
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,040
system did work very well but how do you

307
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,040
plan to provide the security right now

308
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,079
unfortunately right now hakka one is not

309
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,560
accessible

310
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,160
we are looking at other bug bounty

311
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,160
systems like russian systems we've been

312
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,120
looking at kazakhstan

313
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,399
as well

314
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,320
unfortunately

315
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,320
each one of them has certain

316
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,120
complications

317
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,639
for example if they use a russian

318
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,480
related bug balance programs only

319
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,560
russian hackers will come to you and

320
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,160
unfortunately we don't have a lot of

321
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,480
them

322
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,519
most of these countries were delivered

323
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,839
to us by indian and

324
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,920
chinese hunters don't you think they

325
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,680
will go for russian backbones because

326
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,680
many people look at india and china's

327
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,759
partners technological partners in the

328
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,680
new world from the point of view of

329
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,959
supply of the software and other things

330
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,120
everything's wonderful but the question

331
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,519
is about the money

332
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,000
you find a vulnerability you want to get

333
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,839
some payment for it

334
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,440
but how if we cannot transfer any money

335
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,000
so money transfers cannot be

336
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,399
possible

337
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,600
well

338
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,360
carry money in cases

339
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,839
so what are your plans right now

340
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,880
so right now we're looking at different

341
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,559
options from the point of view back

342
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,640
bounce you we have a big upset team

343
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,640
so we continue

344
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,199
to work in this direction irrespectively

345
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,520
to whether we have hacker one or maybe

346
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,760
we don't have hacker one

347
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,599
we continue

348
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,439
do regular

349
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,839
fan testing for our

350
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,160
products

351
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,480
but what i would like to say

352
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,240
unfortunately

353
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,600
few companies can do that

354
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,679
from the point of view of the price

355
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:42,720
from the point of view of number of

356
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,080
specialists in the market

357
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,840
and of course price

358
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,160
and understanding because we have to

359
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,559
build special processes for this we need

360
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,520
to have understanding why one needs

361
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,760
something like that

362
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,840
this is not a bonding process

363
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,039
developed security develop

364
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,000
secure development vulnerability

365
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,960
bug

366
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,200
hunting

367
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,080
vulnerabilities

368
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,520
prioritization all these steps are very

369
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,200
important they work with developing

370
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,200
teams that work with i.t teams

371
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,280
all these together it's not a process of

372
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,400
one day

373
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,760
and i have the final question to you

374
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,080
alexei

375
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,720
financial sector in russia

376
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,240
is the most protected one as i

377
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,480
understand

378
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,480
if you compare it to other sectors

379
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,640
what do you think how financial sector

380
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,240
will provide security to their own

381
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,440
services

382
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,480
while

383
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,640
the number of their own software

384
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,440
products is very big so what do you

385
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,960
think in the new realities how the

386
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,720
financial sector will provide this

387
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,200
security and how they will maintain

388
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,280
their high level of

389
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,918
security

390
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,880
well this is like a story

391
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,840
the company is looking at russian

392
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,120
products

393
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,799
there's a story

394
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,919
with parallel imports

395
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,200
gray supplies and

396
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,120
as an option how to get around

397
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,799
licensing policies of foreign companies

398
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,679
honestly it is very

399
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,400
hard to say

400
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,360
only time will show us and i think that

401
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,280
by the end of the year it will be more

402
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,679
clear and more understandable whether we

403
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,559
will be able to get around sanctions or

404
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:47,039
replace some part of our products

405
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,400
well it's hard for me to speak

406
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,039
and answer to this question

407
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,559
how other companies are going to move in

408
00:19:58,559 --> 00:19:59,919
this direction

409
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,799
but as i understand

410
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,559
many companies are

411
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,480
opening new vacancies

412
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,240
for the development of their own

413
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,880
software

414
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,600
and to start the import substitution for

415
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,240
the open

416
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,000
source but this will take more than one

417
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,640
month usually two three sometimes even

418
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,919
four

419
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,080
for the transition to

420
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,120
more

421
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,000
global solutions

422
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,200
financial sector it is very important to

423
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,559
be well defended because they deal

424
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,440
with

425
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,919
money a lot of money corporate money

426
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,360
personal money

427
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,880
uh money of physical investors and

428
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,559
it's very important

429
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,440
for the sector to be as protected as was

430
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,280
protected before irrespectively to

431
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,440
what's happening so alexi i wish you

432
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,720
how can we say it in a better way

433
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,640
thank you very much for your wishes

434
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,960
we are

435
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,280
i can tell you that

436
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,840
this special operation and attack

437
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,520
against us

438
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,200
not only against us like kiwi but any

439
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,240
other financial company

440
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,679
it's a best test

441
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,120
security level

442
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,480
and product level and our partners and

443
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,799
it demonstrates

444
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,559
the maximal amount of risks that company

445
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,360
might face and from this point of view

446
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,039
we can say thanks for that

447
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,080
it seems that you can discover the level

448
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,880
of protection because the challenges and

449
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,840
checking for vulnerabilities uh this is

450
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,280
the best check

451
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,120
we had alexey eugene in our studio

452
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,679
director of i.t security and fighting

453
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,840
the fraud in common in kiwi thank you

454
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,639
very much alexey
