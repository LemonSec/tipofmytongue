1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,160
and our next talk is going to focus on

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,839
inverse substitution

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,000
this is a topic that's been relevant for

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,679
the past uh several months and it's here

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,920
to stay in order to understand better

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,320
what's happening i have with me maxine

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,400
phillip of director for development

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,520
business development positive

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,000
technologies

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,519
hello

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,399
talk about empire substitution and let's

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,239
start by your assessment of the current

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,000
state of inverse substitution being the

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,960
process was initiated some time ago then

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,039
it was intensified and something should

16
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,520
be happening right now so what is the

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,600
current standing of input substitution

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,199
let's start with your maxim

19
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:53,920
well

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,000
from outside of our company and i think

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,480
we have a pretty objective perspective

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,879
on the things input substitution today

23
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,440
has become a process that studied let's

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,760
go and you don't need to persuade people

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,560
in anything last week there was a

26
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,240
presidential order uh which said that

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,880
from 2025

28
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,119
and no uh

29
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,320
protection means from

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,240
not friendly countries should be used

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,000
but even before this order came out it

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,079
was became clear before the start of the

33
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,200
military

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,280
uh operation but even before that

35
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,040
actually like i said uh

36
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,640
foreign began to leave the russian

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,720
market and import substitution is a need

38
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,960
that must be addressed quite

39
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,360
quickly

40
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,159
it must be addressed quite quite quickly

41
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,680
i mean

42
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,759
today uh customers are building their

43
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,159
processes so that here and now they can

44
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,280
solve the problems that they are facing

45
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,840
because of a certain position of some of

46
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,399
the vendors all vendors take um

47
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,800
different routes to leaving the russian

48
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,920
market and we hear which we hear stories

49
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,560
we know from our customers that

50
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,080
some

51
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,560
updates uh

52
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,840
some updates led to a freezing of their

53
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,239
products uh other products are not

54
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,879
updated yet other products were left

55
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,360
without support and we know that cyber

56
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,239
security primarily is expertise

57
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,319
expertise and updates

58
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,840
that

59
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,440
should be downloaded that should be

60
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,480
installed and the products can be become

61
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,720
obsolete very quickly in absence of the

62
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,480
updates in an absence of the expertise

63
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,360
and support and this is part of our

64
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,239
new reality we see that many of our

65
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,760
customers are looking

66
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,000
to substitute the solutions that are

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,280
leaving the russian market or

68
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,920
potentially are under the risk of

69
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,400
being withdrawn from the russian markets

70
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,159
um it's the new normal

71
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,319
what about you what do you think about

72
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,480
empire substitution today well i agree

73
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,319
with what maxim said i um

74
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,360
i also wanted to talk about the market

75
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,239
in uh general and my feeling of the

76
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,840
market in general in the last three

77
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,080
months the time compressed

78
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,959
and empire substitution

79
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,000
before february

80
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,080
[Music]

81
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,599
before february was a hobby

82
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,519
or maybe it was a kind of a pretext and

83
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,680
not to do any substitution some people

84
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,080
believed in it others didn't but uh

85
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,159
today i agree with maxim time has

86
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,720
compressed and i don't see around me any

87
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,200
non-believers in the near future it's an

88
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,280
irreversible process whether we like it

89
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,760
or not is going to be done

90
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,079
today

91
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,520
trust your foreign vendors

92
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,640
[Music]

93
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,319
i mean the answer to everyone is clear

94
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,320
one way or another

95
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,358
substitution programs must be launched

96
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,560
and the customers are doing it as we

97
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,800
speak

98
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,160
this is a double iron curtain double

99
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,000
iron curtain

100
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,680
there are no external technologies and

101
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,040
internally uh the customers do not trust

102
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,360
foreign products and i do not want to

103
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,199
buy foreign products

104
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,759
we even have

105
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,680
uh maybe not very positive cases from

106
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,800
the market but um

107
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,759
we we had contracts right to supply

108
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,680
foreign vendors products the contracts

109
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,800
were signed before february and now the

110
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,040
customers are trying to revert them the

111
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,400
customers are returning the products and

112
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,880
they are asking for a refund

113
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,759
well

114
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,039
what do you do well we are negotiating

115
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,680
i'm talking now about the markets

116
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,639
attitude to foreign products really it's

117
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,039
important

118
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,320
the customers we are also in close

119
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,919
contact with the customers and they are

120
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,320
saying that even if uh

121
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,759
today you uh do a kind of a mental

122
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,560
experiment all the foreign vendors are

123
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,440
coming back um tomorrow and they're

124
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,120
offering huge discounts many of the

125
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,039
customers will say no to them in the

126
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,720
past this risk was

127
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,400
seen as a hypothetical

128
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,080
is just a threat the governments are

129
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,240
negotiating that way and we are

130
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,639
businesses we are outside of

131
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,720
those negotiations but now the risk is

132
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,440
real and even if they come back the risk

133
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,919
is still yeah many customers in the

134
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,360
future would not be

135
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,680
willing to place their bets on the

136
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,199
vendors on the

137
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,400
uh suppliers who just like that oh no we

138
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,240
because of geopolitics many companies

139
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,560
want to be outside of geopolitics it's

140
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,319
our business we

141
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,919
don't want to be involved with

142
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,400
geopolitics but they can't be left

143
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,400
outside of geopolitics

144
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,639
they can't stay neutral uh

145
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,360
you are as a customer

146
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,039
i mean customers are the greatest

147
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,000
treasurer uh they must be the number one

148
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,720
priority but uh the customers are being

149
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,039
set up

150
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,880
what about you what about numbers do you

151
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,800
see any differences in the import

152
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,400
substitution

153
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,600
do you see the trend accelerating

154
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,039
well actually i will agree with

155
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,120
colleagues and

156
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,840
before foreign vendors left as the

157
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,919
substitution situation was well first of

158
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:50,720
all

159
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,880
substitution can be split into two parts

160
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,319
there is infrastructure and there is

161
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,039
information security infosec and these

162
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,639
are two different

163
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,400
processes

164
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,680
for sac began to develop russian infosec

165
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,319
started to develop much earlier and it

166
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,520
started with the development of

167
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,960
technologies and products while

168
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,400
infrastructure

169
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,360
impr

170
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,800
uber substitution uh studied later and

171
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,560
there is a big difference between these

172
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,160
two components the process of

173
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,080
transformation substitution information

174
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,960
security started a long time ago and now

175
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,280
it's more obvious

176
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,560
and it's more visible as a result

177
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,840
we have today a lot of available russian

178
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,080
products that we never had before in the

179
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,080
last three months we saw

180
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,240
a surge of

181
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,120
new uh new vendors

182
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,120
well do they came out of the blue it's

183
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,800
just that they were not visible well

184
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,039
they adjusted they were not visible but

185
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,879
now there is demand for these products

186
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,680
our partners our customers have demand

187
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,039
for substitution of this or that product

188
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,400
and suddenly you see companies that were

189
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,720
developing some niche products for some

190
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,400
uh one two customers but now they are

191
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,319
going national they are going big time

192
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,360
and

193
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,319
it's one of the probably benefits of the

194
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,000
current situation these technologies are

195
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,199
becoming more available these

196
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,120
technologies perhaps are not very mature

197
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,240
yet but soon they will become mature

198
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,919
as more and more customers use them

199
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,000
as to the demand

200
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,560
we see in all segments the demand

201
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,280
growing in infrastructure and infosec

202
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,919
all kinds of classes of solutions but

203
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,919
the most important

204
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,000
thing probably that we felt is

205
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,440
protection of apps and web services and

206
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,120
infosec web

207
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,519
and network security exactly now

208
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,640
security something we discussed

209
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,839
yesterday

210
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,160
you asked about numbers

211
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,120
this year again i would divide into two

212
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,080
parts sales request for sales and

213
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,680
requests for other services right

214
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,519
they demand in

215
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,440
sales

216
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,519
is growing at 20 30

217
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,839
every year which is quite a traditional

218
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,399
rate of growth

219
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,920
there are sales but i mean we are

220
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,399
talking about now right yeah we are

221
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,160
talking about the start of the year

222
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,640
but what's interesting is

223
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,760
we see a great demand for new products

224
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,440
completely new products

225
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,760
in march we'll launch the website it's

226
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,760
called abner vistos

227
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,040
that are you

228
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,519
update yourself that are you uh where

229
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,680
you can find a rational analog to

230
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,240
foreign makes in the last

231
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,920
say 45

232
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,880
days we had about 9 000 unique kids

233
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,560
there unique users

234
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,880
uh those who came to the website to find

235
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,600
a russian analogy of foreign products

236
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,000
wow this is an interesting topic russian

237
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,440
analogs

238
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,960
do you think we'll be able to

239
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,160
[Music]

240
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,000
substitute foreign products

241
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,959
well as lava brought up

242
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,839
demand into the conversation

243
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,240
all our sales happen through a partner

244
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,399
network

245
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,040
and all of our partners

246
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,240
are feeling quite positive

247
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,720
to their clients

248
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,600
uh various technologies

249
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,279
and customers are asking for our

250
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,880
products in particular they are saying

251
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,079
where is positive products

252
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,079
and partners and and customers they are

253
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,040
planning their input substitution in a

254
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,560
very precise

255
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,959
manner the infrastruct security

256
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,518
landscape

257
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,000
is being substituted with russian

258
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,640
analogues

259
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,480
the departure of foreign vendors

260
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,959
and i would estimate it

261
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,880
at 80 billion perhaps rubles yes 80

262
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,760
billion robots

263
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,959
and most of that market is addressable

264
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,680
with positive technologies products they

265
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,880
are the segments where positive

266
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,800
technologies has their own solutions and

267
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,200
today the biggest challenge for us is to

268
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,120
build our relations with customers and

269
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,640
with partners in a way that will enable

270
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,040
us to be efficient and commercially

271
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,680
successful

272
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,440
the value of infosec market

273
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,519
we are not sure if it's going to grow or

274
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,839
not

275
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,519
there is this big segment i mean we are

276
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,000
talking about dozens of billions of

277
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,360
robots here

278
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,680
that's been left and today the market

279
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,920
will be redistributed between other

280
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,000
players

281
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,639
let me add something to maxim's words

282
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,800
in infosec market

283
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,160
in this market

284
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,440
you have

285
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,839
different stacks of solutions and these

286
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,200
different types of solutions have

287
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,680
different

288
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,959
deployment cycles

289
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,200
in infrastructure

290
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,079
the cycle time will be longer and will

291
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:10,880
be

292
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,480
more costly and labor-intensive

293
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,760
what i was talking about look what kind

294
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,240
of range a year two years that's the

295
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,920
normal cycle for a project

296
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,279
implementation

297
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,360
another thing is that not all solution

298
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,000
stacks have

299
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,160
russian analogs

300
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,639
that can be a one-to-one match

301
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,120
to foreign western

302
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,680
solutions

303
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,399
so you have to be creative

304
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,279
the paradigm that we are broadcasting to

305
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,839
the market today is that

306
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,320
you need to approach input substitution

307
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,959
with good thoughts i mean you have to

308
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,519
start with your current

309
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,079
landscape

310
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,880
a trusted environment can be built with

311
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,360
a residual use of

312
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,079
western solutions

313
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,399
there are good analogs

314
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,360
for

315
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,639
security

316
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,040
monitoring systems like the products

317
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,800
from positive

318
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,079
and also security monitoring systems are

319
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,399
a good defense against cyber attacks and

320
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,120
they must be built on the basis of

321
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,079
domestic solutions but again you have to

322
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,079
think about the time

323
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,839
time frame of the

324
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,480
project deployment i mean customers can

325
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,399
already get results within six months

326
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,199
and

327
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,760
since today we are fighting cyber war

328
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,279
i mean these solutions are very much in

329
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,959
demand and since we're talking about

330
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,839
deployment and long times

331
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,360
once you

332
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,040
open the door to a customer and

333
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,639
substitute a foreign product there the

334
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,480
vendor can stay there for one time

335
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,800
because to change it back i mean if

336
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,920
tomorrow the reality is different and we

337
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,320
get back to the old tracks

338
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,639
the president's decree

339
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,720
talks about 2025 and 2025 uh the

340
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,760
landscape must be free of the solutions

341
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,120
from unfriendly countries

342
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,360
and many people in the market comment

343
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,760
that this is such a long time such a

344
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,880
long time why not now well i think that

345
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,519
it is a short time in fact we don't have

346
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,760
much time many heavy solutions of

347
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,519
information security that require

348
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,880
designing

349
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,920
of the infrastructure surrounding them

350
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,120
uh

351
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,839
left alone the i mean without even

352
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,360
mentioning the installation the

353
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,440
deployment and live systems i mean this

354
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,560
is such a short time frame and today the

355
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,360
customers have already started to run

356
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,600
and i think that this is a hard to

357
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,920
achieve deadline

358
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,279
this presidential decree also says that

359
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,160
uh

360
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,920
the solutions from unfriendly countries

361
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,040
must be substituted while we

362
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,440
know that some countries are neutral and

363
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,920
last week one of the top government

364
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,680
officials said that one of the

365
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,920
government meetings i show that the list

366
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,600
of unfriendly countries will not be

367
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,199
different by december 2024 so the

368
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,959
question is what are we to substitute

369
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,279
all solutions not everything well i

370
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,199
think that all of the stack must be

371
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,519
replaced with domestic solutions

372
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,600
what about industries which industries

373
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,839
needs

374
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,160
member substitution immediately

375
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,079
well from the industry perspective the

376
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,079
government has always been the driving

377
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,399
force i mean governments owned

378
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,800
state-owned companies have always led to

379
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,399
the process for them is critical

380
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,720
as to

381
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,279
the future

382
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,079
of various industries i think that we

383
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,639
should primarily think about

384
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,680
financial structures transportation

385
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,199
energy telecom these are the industries

386
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,920
that have great need for security and

387
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,959
they are often victims of all kinds of

388
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,399
cyber threats and also potentially this

389
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,440
market is open to russian products

390
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,399
historically in the russian market of

391
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,120
cyber security one of the key drivers

392
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,160
has always been regulatory requirements

393
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,759
i think it's something that we should

394
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,320
still consider and factor in the

395
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,160
presidential decree defines the

396
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,240
structures and the legal entities for

397
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,440
which

398
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,920
that process is critical the

399
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,639
system building the government-owned

400
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,320
government

401
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,800
authorities but what we see today in

402
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,519
fact is commercial banks commercial

403
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,098
banks have nothing to do with government

404
00:17:07,098 --> 00:17:08,400
[Music]

405
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,319
ownership

406
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,599
they are running very very fast

407
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,760
because they feel their needs

408
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,760
they feel the urgency

409
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,680
it's not some

410
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,000
[Music]

411
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,959
you know

412
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,640
government official

413
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,880
regulating something

414
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,480
for the sake of the greatness of the

415
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,960
country but it's the commercial

416
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,960
companies that feel

417
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,240
they need cyber security cyber stability

418
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,960
is the same as business stability

419
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,039
non-stop operation of business and we

420
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,880
see this demand coming from the market

421
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,200
today

422
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,840
and to

423
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,880
summarize say

424
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,400
it's irreversible i mean the process is

425
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,799
irreversible

426
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,039
and it's going to last for the next

427
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,840
several decades

428
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,919
why am i saying this hypothetically even

429
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,679
if all the foreign vendors come back

430
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,160
tomorrow there is no more any trust to

431
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,960
them when trust in a sensitive area such

432
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,960
as cyber security

433
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,160
means

434
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,880
lots it means loads

435
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,960
like you you come to your family talk to

436
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,720
the family doctor knows everything about

437
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,960
you and then the doctor panics and

438
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,440
leaves you and says no i'm not going to

439
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,919
treat you anymore and i'm going to tell

440
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,320
all your secrets to all of the world

441
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,160
and then in the week's time the doctor

442
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,000
comes back and says to say hey i

443
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,720
panicked i was wrong uh let me treat you

444
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,520
again i don't think you will continue

445
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,120
your relations with the doctor when you

446
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,480
enter the infrastructure you become a

447
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,440
trusted doctor right a physician the

448
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,520
client trusts your technology the client

449
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,480
trusts

450
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,480
your expertise you develop the protein

451
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,640
technology together you make it better

452
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,720
so just to

453
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,880
change you know the positive solution uh

454
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,760
for some other vendor solution it will

455
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,200
be uh

456
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,280
it will take a long time it will be

457
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,039
expensive this is something that our

458
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,640
customers have to do now they are

459
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,880
changing foreign solutions

460
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,600
for domestic ones and they're doing this

461
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,360
because they really do not have a choice

462
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,120
but if they had a choice

463
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,640
if they had a choice i mean this is

464
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,640
expensive it's expensive and it takes a

465
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,200
long time if they had the choice they

466
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,200
wouldn't be doing it and they would be

467
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,840
uh in their right so when russian

468
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,280
infosec

469
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,919
vendors partners enter the landscape of

470
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,600
a customer it means that they will stay

471
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,280
so again that's why i'm saying that the

472
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,919
processes is reversible uh for the next

473
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,919
decades it's irreversible and it's

474
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,360
ambitious

475
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,320
because

476
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,440
we all now enter a new field of

477
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,039
opportunities there is demand from the

478
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,559
market there is regulation there is

479
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,960
support from the state

480
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,679
there is cyber war i wanted to say thank

481
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,360
god there is cyber war but well there is

482
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,360
cyber war everything we are doing now is

483
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,840
not going to be tested not on a virtual

484
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,919
mock-up at the standoff is going to be

485
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,200
tested in

486
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,440
real life settings and if we can

487
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,840
demonstrate the

488
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,480
infosec uh

489
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,559
uh invo sec maturity of russian

490
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,400
solutions then it's a good opportunity

491
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,440
yes exactly i think that in the infosec

492
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,919
russia can offer excellent products to

493
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,679
the global community we can demonstrate

494
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,919
that in the country we've got efficient

495
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,799
solutions that can achieve

496
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,440
infosec objectives that can

497
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,760
make

498
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,480
unacceptable events impossible

499
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,400
and is built on the stack of

500
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,320
technologies that are developed and

501
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,240
produced in country and we don't have an

502
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,000
option

503
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,159
we do not have a choice yesterday we had

504
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,559
several interviews uh where we mentioned

505
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,400
three global leaders in uh infosec uh

506
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,640
everyone agrees that the united states

507
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,559
israel and russia are all leaders of

508
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,400
information security russia was also

509
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,559
always mentioned as one of the leaders

510
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,360
of infosec we've got

511
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,400
brainy guys here guys and girls who know

512
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,039
how to code

513
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,400
so the market is huge

514
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,000
right

515
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,919
the products are available what are the

516
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:14,880
risks

517
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,120
at the same time

518
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,960
i can talk to this topic

519
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,440
i see two main risks

520
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,720
one risk

521
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,120
as always i'm responsible for sales and

522
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,039
the nightmare of a salesperson as the

523
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,799
customer runs out of money in normal

524
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,360
budgets they can't pay so the one big

525
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,360
risk is

526
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,919
uh customers will not have money they

527
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,960
will not have budgets

528
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,120
the degree that we keep referring to

529
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,159
today because it's such a new regulation

530
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,440
comes directly from the russian

531
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,799
president that says that information

532
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,919
security is a priority for the state it

533
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,559
is a priority for

534
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,240
individual companies

535
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,080
and institutions that's why i think that

536
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,559
i mean it is the answer it's going to

537
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,960
address the risk in a way and

538
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,760
information security will be budgeted

539
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,520
for

540
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,919
risk 2 is country related it's

541
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,200
everything that's

542
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,240
related to hardware this

543
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,520
risk is

544
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,000
still with us

545
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,960
the positive uh develop solutions but

546
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,600
our software solutions recommend

547
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,760
hardware platforms today we have

548
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,960
problems

549
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,280
in this area and some projects have been

550
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,840
suspended or postponed or slowed down

551
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,159
because of the lack of

552
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,280
hardware

553
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,520
distributors who are bringing in

554
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,440
hardware and the customers and the

555
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,440
government even are trying to find

556
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,679
solutions they are trying to

557
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,080
get the support they are trying to find

558
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,840
uh hardware

559
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,000
delivery channels for our software

560
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,919
products and we are thinking about it as

561
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,960
well well at the moment we can overcome

562
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,280
this shortage of hardware new platforms

563
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,679
we hope very much that it will be model

564
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,440
next several months but this risk is

565
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,840
significant and i'm going to name it as

566
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,879
the second biggest risk

567
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,880
our

568
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,360
strengths is in the people is in their

569
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,840
brains and in the level of training of

570
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,919
the people

571
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,280
it's a risk

572
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,559
it's not a problem it's a task that must

573
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,440
be

574
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,679
solved must be addressed we also see the

575
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,840
support from the government secondly the

576
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,039
industry itself begins to renegotiate

577
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,559
the customers the vendors the partners

578
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,559
the integrators they

579
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,880
come to a new uh agreement that they

580
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,720
need to replicate themselves that is to

581
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,360
say they need to invest into training as

582
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,440
a basis for our development

583
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,919
and maybe i can add something to maxim's

584
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,279
words

585
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,799
in terms of budgets a year ago at phd um

586
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,840
at the plenary session i was saying that

587
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,919
the top

588
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,039
managers of companies need to pay close

589
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,919
attention to infrasecurity so you have

590
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,080
to be careful what you wish for right

591
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,399
today

592
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,678
it's always think about it

593
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,880
well i got repeat foreign vendors come

594
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,039
back to russia why am i saying this then

595
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,600
the process if they do the process will

596
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,159
slow down and uh now we are being

597
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,240
propelled uh very fast in the

598
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,679
development of these technologies and

599
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,919
promotions products in the market

600
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,679
we are catering to the demand that

601
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,080
exists but it can slow down if

602
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,840
something goes wrong if

603
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,080
uh

604
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,320
the sanctions are lifted if the foreign

605
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,880
vendors are making a comeback i think

606
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,880
that this will be a new risk for the

607
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,520
development of domestic technologies

608
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,039
i think today there are plenty of

609
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,159
opportunities for the russian

610
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,080
technologies to

611
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:52,960
be

612
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,640
not even in the top three to be the

613
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,080
number one in the

614
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,240
i've world receiving use of this cyber

615
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,400
battle there were three hacks of the

616
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,880
railway

617
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,760
so import substitution is a very

618
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,360
relevant

619
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,600
topic especially for the companies and

620
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,039
industries on which we depend

621
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,159
and i'm

622
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,880
happy to hear the optimism and your

623
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,279
words i'm happy to hear you have been

624
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,520
optimistic about the future of the

625
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,559
russian infrastack a market

626
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,760
let's do good products let's make

627
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,720
secure products reliable yeah that's

628
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,840
what we are working on
