1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,480
let's continue non-stop speaking about

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,519
cyber security about technologies it's

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,280
very interesting sometimes very

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,160
difficult but really possible and right

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,560
now we're going to speak about open

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,720
source and right now i have denis cora

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,960
belov together with me denise is a

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,439
managing director product director in

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,199
positive technologies comedy and to me

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,279
personally denise is the main source of

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,480
news events and details about open

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,359
source

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,120
tell me please denise why you and open

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,800
source are

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,480
inseparable

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,960
why do you need open source

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,280
well you know there are things

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,200
those gloves

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,239
which you

20
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,879
should had or they might not happen

21
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,280
without you so globally speaking in i.t

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,520
all programmers they love open source

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,160
because this is a way of making public

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,960
striptease so you put out your code and

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,320
everybody can look at it and this is

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,920
cool

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,159
so this is like dory underwear

28
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,520
publishing no no it's very clue close to

29
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,520
the arts for example you write poetry

30
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,119
but you never show it to anybody and

31
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,400
then at a certain moment of time you

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,240
publish it and you hear the feedback and

33
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,040
this is a very very vulnerable moment

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,200
when they give a good feedback you feel

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,840
nice and uplifted

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,439
and it gives very interesting effect

37
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,119
everybody loves open source and when you

38
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,560
come to programmers okay let's publish

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,479
this you say to the programmers and you

40
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,159
see the whole gamut of emotions which

41
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,920
might happen with the person because he

42
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,600
imagines that somebody will be able to

43
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,400
see

44
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,960
all your patches uh it's good to give it

45
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,960
to the client

46
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,720
it's normal to go to the fraud but the

47
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,320
fact that other programmers will look at

48
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,640
it it's like you know it touches the

49
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,799
soul of the author and it's interesting

50
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,920
effect and phenomenon because

51
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,000
globally speaking about programming it's

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,640
a big art than a generic activity and

53
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,000
there's a lot of things

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,479
which we have to invent in the process

55
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,880
and sometimes they are against all the

56
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,280
school books which are written in order

57
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,119
to make one thing and make it cool and

58
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,040
when you publish this code which

59
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,800
somebody can evaluate and say well that

60
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,479
was really cool i've looked at it and

61
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,480
this is wonderful

62
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,840
you know this is something that many

63
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,000
programmers have been motivated by and

64
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
they live by this and this is one

65
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,440
positive things when we've been working

66
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,440
in some other companies

67
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,440
we've been applying this experience and

68
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,760
i know about this feeling myself that's

69
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,400
why in positive technologies i also try

70
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,319
to cultivate this thing

71
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,319
so speaking about open source speaking

72
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,160
about the stories of open source are you

73
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,440
the person

74
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,920
who wants to share and get certain

75
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,440
approval for this or maybe you're a

76
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,400
criticist or you give the facebook or

77
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,000
you like to get the feedback or maybe

78
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,319
denise is a person who

79
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,080
asking okay show me what you have and i

80
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,840
will give you the

81
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,959
you know i'm more about writing than uh

82
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,879
reading

83
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,040
so this is my standard approach and

84
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,599
sincerely i do

85
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,480
love to publish things

86
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,280
out of what i do what company does

87
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,040
but what is a main value for me

88
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,959
when you published something and it was

89
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,519
evaluated and people started sharing it

90
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,400
improving it approving it feedback

91
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,640
it lives different life it's like you

92
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,760
gave birth to a child

93
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,480
and

94
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,040
this child starts making the first steps

95
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,519
and then he turns you and he says father

96
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,640
you live the wrong life well this is a

97
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,799
during teenage age

98
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,200
previously he is uh obedient and then he

99
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,040
is disobedient okay can you tell me

100
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,080
please how wide is the experience of

101
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,920
applying the open source honestly

102
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,239
speaking in business for example you

103
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,000
come to the companies

104
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,159
how often

105
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,200
you know

106
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,280
it depends on geography well speaking

107
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,280
about russia well speaking about russia

108
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,400
it's not really white why

109
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,080
there is one psychological aspect which

110
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,680
is very important when you publish as a

111
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,439
company something to public artists

112
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,040
there's an illusion that it can be

113
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,000
stolen from you yes of course

114
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,760
i do not of course

115
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,519
and they can damage your beauty you've

116
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,040
been writing and writing it and then

117
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,120
somebody came and put a piece of

118
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,880
inside of it and you're looking at it oh

119
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,798
my god yeah you're looking at it but you

120
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,720
may not take it into your branch and

121
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,160
they will see that this branch is done

122
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,759
by somebody else but you're beautiful

123
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,199
you made something beautiful so this

124
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,600
problem is not available it's not a

125
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,360
the problem is when somebody on the

126
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,520
basis of this can do something better or

127
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,000
maybe sell it

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
this is an illusion because

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,320
the code is a very complicated construct

130
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,880
that you have to understand in order to

131
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,040
add something to dc you need a team of

132
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,040
people one person will not be able to do

133
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,720
anything about it and while you're

134
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,479
understanding this the one who published

135
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,000
it he will be able to write something

136
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,320
more so you will always be behind so

137
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,880
it's a topic that

138
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,720
it's more a psychological problem than a

139
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,560
real problem so i sincerely believe in

140
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,800
it because a strong team which publish

141
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,880
everything in open source is always

142
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,720
ahead of everybody who takes it and

143
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,960
tries to extend it just because they

144
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,560
don't have the competencies they didn't

145
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,000
do it before they don't know anything

146
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,400
about it etc so psychological aspect is

147
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,759
present

148
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,639
and the needs are not available so they

149
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,120
need to dig in the needs of which need

150
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,440
they have not on behalf of me denis but

151
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,120
on behalf of the company because when

152
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,479
the company something publishes

153
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,680
something in the public

154
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,160
it looks like there is no special

155
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,320
advantage to this on one side the

156
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,479
advantage is that many people start

157
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,039
contributing from this site and you get

158
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,880
some free improvement of this product on

159
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,440
the other side it's a strong pr because

160
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,440
for the developers the company which

161
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,120
makes the public product

162
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,600
it's a cooler pro company than the one

163
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,360
who makes a closed product

164
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,039
because i don't know how to explain it

165
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,600
but let's imagine you come and work for

166
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,919
talented people who publish all their

167
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,319
poetry but those who write in the table

168
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,919
you know nothing about it you don't know

169
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,880
how cool are their poetry so you come to

170
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,960
the close the door and when they open

171
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,400
this door you will figure out what they

172
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,919
have in real life but when it's been

173
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,440
published in the public and you can

174
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,039
evaluate all of this and other people

175
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,199
will evaluate it and when they look not

176
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,800
at their own opinion but an opinion of

177
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,639
those whom they trust and if there is an

178
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,160
open source which is admitted by the

179
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,240
open source from the pr point of view

180
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,560
the company wins so the motivation for

181
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,880
these on the side of western companies

182
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,639
has been sold out companies understand

183
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,560
that by publishing in open source they

184
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,319
kill two robots first one is a

185
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,080
contribution to the product on the other

186
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,319
side it's pr for the developers so it's

187
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,680
much easier for them to find good

188
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,440
employees and employees are

189
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,280
imputing more well can you make an

190
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,199
example of successful

191
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,400
successful company which successfully

192
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,240
publishes something in the open source

193
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,199
and this something is real uh good and

194
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,440
around their developments there's a big

195
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,039
thing what you've been speaking about

196
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,039
some publicity well the well-known

197
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,280
example of the open source is linux

198
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,720
linux yeah

199
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,800
linux operating system linux by itself

200
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,240
is not a commercial company but many

201
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,160
commercial commons which take this linux

202
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,160
core i think that linux is not a correct

203
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,520
example but it's not a company

204
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,960
it's a development of a person well

205
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,880
there is a core

206
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,720
there's a commercial distribution

207
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,000
red hat

208
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,360
red hat

209
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,160
commercial distribution susie

210
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,199
and there's a number of commercial

211
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,280
distributions which are very expensive

212
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,720
and these are commercial products and

213
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,319
they also open source completely and

214
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,400
they are built on the basis of linux and

215
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,280
they sell their expertise and support

216
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,960
elasticsearch

217
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,840
elasticsearch which is used by many

218
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,360
products and this is also open source

219
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,720
product

220
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,400
and there's a lot of them click house a

221
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,080
good database

222
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,120
which is produced by yandex and

223
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,199
we also use it as a company and it has

224
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,759
as i know possibility of monetization

225
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,680
when you take it for certain additional

226
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,840
services like

227
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,199
toronto uh done by dk it's also a

228
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,879
database which has commercial version

229
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,960
what comes earlier open source or

230
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,120
commercial version commercial version is

231
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,400
like a uh branching so we have invented

232
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,680
something beautiful and then we have

233
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,120
invented how to make money on it and

234
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,879
made a commercial branch of it or it can

235
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,160
be differently well

236
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,000
it's different every time it's different

237
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
there is no

238
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,800
rule of the thumb

239
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,720
it's a part of strategy basically

240
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,800
commercial company might decide that we

241
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,919
would like to

242
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,000
kill two birds in one rock and make an

243
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,880
open source for example or maybe

244
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,279
a person didn't have resources they were

245
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,719
same thinkers they've done something

246
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,000
open source at the certain moment of

247
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,080
time to understand that it's widely used

248
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,240
and we can build a business it was open

249
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,800
source and that made some license

250
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,000
they started monetization

251
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,680
we should understand that open source is

252
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,920
not some property of this software

253
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,720
because this software in its core has

254
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,880
the source code but who sees them the

255
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,279
company or everybody and how this is

256
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,800
being sold that's a question number two

257
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,600
you can sell open source uh you

258
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,200
but what is the meaning of selling open

259
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,240
source

260
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,720
no you see a separate

261
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,959
will be able to fix it because software

262
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,000
is something very complicated

263
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,080
consisting of a hundred components and

264
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,880
even if everything is in open source uh

265
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,720
you need certain skills and competencies

266
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,720
to make it operational in addition to

267
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,240
the fact that it has to be implemented

268
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,040
supported uh lifted and on all of this

269
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,880
you also can earn some money if you are

270
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,279
so smart that you can make a sample and

271
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,040
use it from the open source it means

272
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,040
that none of the manufacturers of this

273
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,880
open source will not get disappointed

274
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,760
because

275
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,040
it's going to be a compliment to your

276
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,320
direction that this person

277
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
they made uh working ecosystems and they

278
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,800
use it almost boxed version yeah the box

279
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,760
version for yourselves they've

280
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,000
customized it so much they dived into it

281
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,399
so much

282
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,080
for example your writer and suddenly

283
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,399
there is a criticist who says well you

284
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,160
haven't properly evaluated the relations

285
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,600
between these people but it doesn't

286
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,040
happen but on one side it's not really

287
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,279
nice he criticizes you but on the other

288
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,800
side

289
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,959
on the other side he's like he loves

290
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,880
this and he could not do it without

291
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,320
loving it

292
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,240
okay can you tell me please

293
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,079
how do you build relations with

294
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:18,640
legislation with uh ip property

295
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,920
intellectual property because open

296
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,200
source is

297
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,880
something public publicly made and

298
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,640
friendly relations and when it comes to

299
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,920
the business

300
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,480
then the laws of patents and ip comes

301
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,920
into the force yes there are different

302
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,920
types of licenses even for the open

303
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,519
source for example

304
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,519
there's a gpl license

305
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,200
which tells you that if you use this

306
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,760
source code

307
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,320
you should open uh something that with

308
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,320
which you use so you have to open these

309
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,399
uh open source for proprietary products

310
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,320
and there's a license which tells

311
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,560
different you can modify it as well as

312
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,000
well as you want you can sell it you can

313
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,079
do anything without it

314
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,160
and these licenses are like that and in

315
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,640
principle every open source uh in the

316
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,279
header of every file contains a certain

317
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,440
announcement of what kind of a license

318
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,360
is this and there are even special

319
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,519
people in companies uh who research the

320
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,680
types of licenses and how can we use it

321
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,200
i can use these or maybe use it

322
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,720
differently and there's a story that we

323
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,120
cannot impel it but launch it next to

324
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,600
our and we can use the api and well

325
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,079
what is

326
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,160
okay i will formulate and follow me not

327
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,880
because you done it not so good or you

328
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,800
did something wrong but because open

329
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
source i don't know the library have

330
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,320
pulled some

331
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,320
negative things from the internet so

332
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,760
there's a problem on the side of the

333
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,519
client who's been using your product

334
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,880
who's going to be at fault you or the

335
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,800
open source and how you will be able to

336
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,200
solve it solve it everything that you

337
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,959
took for yourself you're responsible for

338
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,959
it you're responsible yourself and

339
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,120
there's no option about it there are no

340
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,040
miracles if you made a commercial

341
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,800
product

342
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,079
and you have to separate two stories the

343
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,839
first one is absolutely commercial story

344
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,279
and the second one it's when it's a

345
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,480
certificate

346
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,800
regulators etc and the process of

347
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,480
certification consists of the fact that

348
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,279
you have to prove that respectively to

349
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,519
some third-party uh components they

350
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,839
don't have injections so if you've been

351
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,200
writing the open source it means that

352
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,440
you're responsible for it fully yes okay

353
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,519
good okay can you tell me please is

354
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,399
there a chance to see something positive

355
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,600
in the open source life

356
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,040
well you see there's a separate topic

357
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,320
which is very important and i would like

358
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,880
to speak about it it's a story about on

359
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,480
one side our solution in the area of

360
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,279
cyber security cyber security uh since

361
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,800
recent events

362
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,639
it became geopolitized uh geopolitical

363
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,199
some countries don't like to use a cyber

364
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,440
software not from their own country and

365
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,279
not from their locations was always like

366
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,839
that because it's a very sensitive thing

367
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,920
uh because it protected protects

368
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,760
sensitive data so generally speaking

369
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,360
there's a mistrust

370
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,440
some people have done it nobody knows

371
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,880
how they check it how they do it it's

372
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,800
our country etc

373
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,120
so the answer to these is a simple and

374
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,880
understable one if you open everything

375
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,480
that you've done you cannot uh

376
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,000
say that you have some injections you

377
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,440
have opened the code okay show me where

378
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,760
the injections search for them

379
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,240
easy but if i'll find it well if they

380
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,920
are available out there nobody have been

381
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,680
put those injections it's a story that

382
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,680
you're confident in yourself so much but

383
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,279
they may not believe you

384
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,440
so how can you prove it you can open

385
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,199
this code make it open source and this

386
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,399
is the only way the only path to go to

387
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,040
wider geographies in order to make your

388
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,279
products popular so in principle these

389
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,120
barriers have been available there

390
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,959
nothing has been changing in recent

391
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,440
years but in order for other guy from

392
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,360
another country to take it complete it

393
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,360
improve it and somebody else

394
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,000
made and install this enterprise into in

395
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,920
well this is the only version when this

396
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,800
product is open source and you come out

397
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,160
and you say okay look at it if you'll

398
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,920
find injections i will be very surprised

399
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,199
i will investigate it but there is

400
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,160
nothing

401
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,360
so

402
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,440
if we're speaking about positive as soon

403
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,000
as we think about geography much wider

404
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,279
we are doomed to working this way and

405
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,680
then the next one is the next question

406
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,600
okay you kind of avoided the question

407
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,199
okay dear friends

408
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,839
will we get positive and open source

409
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,160
it's not really understandable uh most

410
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,720
likely i don't know in my studio i have

411
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,639
denis corble denise thank you very much

412
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,399
it was really interesting i was very

413
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,560
interested and i hope that our viewers

414
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,480
also was interested please don't switch

415
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,320
off and right now we're moving forward

416
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,800
and we are going to have

417
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,680
three or four guests and little

418
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,000
excursions around our site it's going to

419
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,040
be very cool
