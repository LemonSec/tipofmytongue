1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,000
okay

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,800
so

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,960
no chit chat we're gonna we're gonna

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,319
begin

5
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,919
our round table and

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,040
so the

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,599
let's say again uh the round table is

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,000
the challenges for cyber security

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,160
conferences part two

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,119
we

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,880
have met here

12
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,160
exactly one year ago exactly same set of

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,840
people

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,279
at phd stem to discuss pretty much the

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,920
same problems but back in the day

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,280
they were

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,600
new for us we all we all struggled we

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,000
all found a way to get over our

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,719
struggles and now i want to

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,360
get like postmortem of what have we

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,120
learned have you learned anything

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,280
actually or not but i would like to

23
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,840
start with the introduction because it

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,600
one year later we figured out that there

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,520
is no still there is no bio on the

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,280
website uh so it's good to have

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,840
in recording the introduction of each

28
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,520
one of you i think i will start with

29
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,559
igor

30
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,439
okay now my name is igor lukic i i live

31
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,040
in spain i have a congress conference

32
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,320
called hakron

33
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,840
and my background is as i think like 99

34
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,759
we start when we're kids

35
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,560
get in the underground space whatever

36
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,000
get in trouble

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,680
and learn about technology learn about

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,400
the hacking scene get around meet people

39
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,479
thanks to the conferences like this

40
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,280
and

41
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,200
my background just pushed me to to make

42
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,799
my own conference

43
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,600
and

44
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,600
i don't know just get into the

45
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,360
geek space and

46
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,880
and die there

47
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,720
because it's once you get in there's no

48
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,040
way out i think so that's my background

49
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,640
then the first

50
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,920
on the screen is asim

51
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,880
hey everyone i'm

52
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,439
assim jacker i'm the co-founder of a

53
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,880
cyber security company called biato

54
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,799
we have three pillars in the company one

55
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,719
of them is conferencing where we

56
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,439
organize two cyber security conferences

57
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,280
nulcon and hardware.io

58
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,000
the other one is consulting where we do

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,959
security assessments for iot embedded

60
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,160
cloud and yada yada and the third one

61
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,319
which i look after is the

62
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,040
products so we are working on two

63
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,200
cyber security products one is

64
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,840
uh geared towards automation for

65
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,800
security assessment of iot products

66
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,560
and the other one is

67
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,400
scaling up first testing

68
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,120
for

69
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,200
native and managed code applications

70
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,720
dylan

71
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,560
ah

72
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,720
hey guys dylan here founder of hack in

73
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,239
the box i think i'm probably one of the

74
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,400
oldest people on this panel

75
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,920
so i feel very honored that they still

76
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,680
call the old man back to share his

77
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,040
thoughts

78
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,160
but um

79
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,920
basically my history is that i've been

80
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,000
running this hanging box thing for like

81
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,200
22 years something like that

82
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,120
it's my day job it's essentially all we

83
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,040
do so we run conferences around the

84
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,200
world we're in amsterdam we're in uae

85
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,920

86
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,100

87
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,640
[Music]

88
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,000
we just run competitors we have a good

89
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,640
time uh we run ctfs yeah if you guys

90
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,400
like playing ctfs then you probably

91
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,480
played one of ours as well or you should

92
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,770
uh other than that

93
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,280
[Music]

94
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,959
yeah i mean i started hanging such a

95
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,879
long time ago that you know it was days

96
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,480
when when the modem was something that

97
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,000
people actually knew what it was right

98
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,080
and now yeah nobody knows what happened

99
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,040
coffee and

100
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,080
yeah yeah i do other other things than

101
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,239
than than hanging above stuff but yeah

102
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,920
on occasion i still run a conference

103
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,799
uh well then i will say that i'm the

104
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,879
youngest from all of you

105
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,040
uh my name is timor yunusov i'm one of

106
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,000
the organizers of positive hug days and

107
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,599
i'm also

108
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,519
the organizer and the founder of the

109
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,120
payment village

110
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,879
so

111
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,439
surprisingly i've been at each one of

112
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,400
your conferences over the last 12 months

113
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,040
i didn't do this on purpose but

114
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,040
life life needs to

115
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,560
keep rolling right

116
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,599
uh

117
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,399
and since our last talk we all you you

118
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,959
guys all had at least one conference

119
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,279
and the

120
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,919
my first question is obviously

121
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,840
we were chatting a year ago hey we're

122
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,840
gonna have this we're gonna have that

123
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,240
we're gonna have to rebuild this redo

124
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,720
that reconsider blah blah blah

125
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,360
what actually happened

126
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,000
in this 12 months

127
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,880
what was the biggest struggle for you

128
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,680
what was like major accident that you

129
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,320
had to go through as an organizer as a

130
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,400
speaker as a participant of any other

131
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,919
conferences

132
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,479
what has happened

133
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,440
who starts you do okay

134
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,280
well i think the the worst thing is

135
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,919
still to figure out the covet situation

136
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,400
that's that's always called kobit you

137
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,639
know this thing that for the conferences

138
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,600
it makes everything seem crazy because

139
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,919
in the other hand yes we can have people

140
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:10,720
then

141
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,919
in my case

142
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,840
they were constantly changing

143
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,039
rules

144
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,639
like that the government was like okay

145
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,320
you can have a conference the last one

146
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,520
we did

147
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,240
back in in february in march sorry

148
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,160
and and we were like okay can we have

149
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,840
people yes you can

150
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,160
two weeks later no you cannot have

151
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,880
and and that thing at least in my

152
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,400
situation is the worst because you

153
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,680
cannot plan accordingly uh there's so

154
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,280
many things you have to do physically if

155
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,120
they're public

156
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,639
indoors it changes the complete

157
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,800
background if it's hybrid

158
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,400
it's another challenge

159
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,440
but in my case it was again online

160
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,560
so this didn't change a lot i had to go

161
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,120
back to the same thing you learn some

162
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,720
from the mistakes but others you keep

163
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,080
making them

164
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,680
like the bandwidth thing we had an issue

165
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,960
with the bandwidth the worst thing we

166
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,680
had keynote speaker in the middle live

167
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,840
because we do it live which is a mistake

168
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,039
by my

169
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,960
why should we do it live there's so many

170
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,639
mistakes can go wrong

171
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,639
so just pre record it it's the same

172
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,240
experience and you can even edit it and

173
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,560
make it like a netflix remember deal on

174
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,479
hack flicks that we said that kind of

175
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,960
stuff like make it more immersive but we

176
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,039
i still made the same mistake like just

177
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,479
to what whatever

178
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,560
it disconnected yeah we had a keynote

179
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,919
speaker in the middle

180
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,720
the the router just went crazy and we

181
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,880
had this delay i don't know a minute and

182
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,319
a half

183
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,080
the stream went down but no one still

184
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,160
was watching that yeah no no we were we

185
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,400
had to we had and then you get crazy and

186
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,400
you have to back online everything

187
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,600
freaks out

188
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,240
and and i think my biggest mistake or

189
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,199
fear

190
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,960
is to do it live

191
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,639
that's why we do every single recording

192
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,919
just let you know

193
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,039
oh yeah live live is a big challenge yep

194
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,039
guys

195
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,680
yes all right dylan you won't go first

196
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,240
oh yeah sure uh yeah i mean life is a

197
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,180
challenge life is a challenge

198
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,039
[Laughter]

199
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,520
but yeah i mean

200
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,000
you know i mean

201
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,840
for us we were kind of lucky because

202
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,199
um well we have three conferences right

203
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,000
so

204
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,680
over the last two years everything was

205
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,680
online but at the end of last year the

206
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,919
kobe situation in uae was improving

207
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,080
enough that we could

208
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,520
somehow another

209
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,520
pull off an in-person event

210
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,120
it was by no means easy because uh as

211
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,199
like you know pointed out the

212
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,280
the government rulings logistics all

213
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,880
those things are constantly evolving

214
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,720
from day to day it's in

215
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,639
what's okay today it's not okay tomorrow

216
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,160
and then day after that it's okay again

217
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,240
you know so stuff like that makes it

218
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,560
extremely difficult um

219
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,919
but we took all the learnings that we

220
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,440
did over the last two years so you know

221
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,720
because we were doing everything

222
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,960
virtually for two years we we have our

223
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,960
own streaming platform we have our i

224
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,720
mean our video streaming team is like

225
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,639
super locked in we have a very strong av

226
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,599
team

227
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,400
uh we know what what works what doesn't

228
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,840
in terms of like remote audience

229
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,080
participation how to do the q a with

230
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,280
like live

231
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,280
uh we had a uh normally we have a

232
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,039
virtual studio everything is

233
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,960
pre-recorded by the way we don't do live

234
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,360
talks when it's virtual conference um

235
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,360
for the exact reason that it becomes

236
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,080
problematic occasionally we do do it

237
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,039
live only when the time zone is suitable

238
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,280
for the speaker other than that as in

239
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,199
the speakers in the same time zone when

240
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,639
the conference is happening fine you

241
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,240
want to present it live because internet

242
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,519
latency is probably not going to be a

243
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,440
big deal if you're local but if you're

244
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,958
in the u.s and you're trying to speak in

245
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,559
asia or something like number one it's

246
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,919
going to be ridiculous for you to stay

247
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,519
up it'll be like four o'clock in the

248
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,799
morning and like why would i put you

249
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,159
through that right i just recorded it

250
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,240
bro you want your best presentation not

251
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,480
because you're alive so what you're not

252
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,480
here so we never bother with like you

253
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,680
know getting too caught up with like

254
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,360
whether it's live not live whatever but

255
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,640
you know we took some of our learning

256
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,000
from the last two years about what works

257
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,760
what doesn't which parts you can stream

258
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,560
which parts uh don't work in streaming

259
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,320
um and we took our virtual studio and

260
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,080
made it into a physical studio that was

261
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,000
centerpiece within the exhibition we did

262
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,640
virtualize silent stages so everybody

263
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,160
stays in one room so there's all the

264
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,640
contact tracing is in one space

265
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,800
i mean there's lots of small things but

266
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,600
would we need to do it after this

267
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,519
maybe not after a year

268
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,399
i would say at most we're gonna do

269
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,760
this kind of like you know physical

270
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,360
distance kind of thing it's just overall

271
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,800
people's comfort

272
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,240
but in different countries people have

273
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,440
different level of comfort you know i

274
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,959
mean in asia we were just talking about

275
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,560
it before the session started that like

276
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,160
here people are complying they wear mars

277
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,279
blah blah

278
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,040
in europe like in skipper you don't in

279
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,640
the airport yeah in shipboard which is

280
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,160
to me it's like oh that's crazy like in

281
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,600
the airport which is an indoor building

282
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,279
with air conditioning with so many

283
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,800
people you don't need to wear a mask

284
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,360
it's not mandated i'm not like

285
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,120
different risk right i mean it's how

286
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,440
you're gonna weigh it but um yeah it's

287
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,720
been interesting it's been an

288
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,000
interesting two years but i'm more

289
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,680
looking forward to what's ahead i always

290
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,959
look ahead so

291
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,880
i'm excited to kind of like see

292
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,600
how conferences will change because they

293
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,839
have to uh the simple reason is that

294
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,839
what was last time was oversaturated

295
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:06,720
right i mean there's too many

296
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,000
conferences the experience is all the

297
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,279
same it's like doesn't matter you got a

298
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,720
black hat defcon why what the hell it's

299
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,640
the same thing

300
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,519
why

301
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,680
right i i've now because i haven't

302
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,040
traveled for two years i've gotten so

303
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,560
used to staying at home right like that

304
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,279
i i feel like the inclination to make me

305
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,959
go to an event needs to be like

306
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:23,920
something

307
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,519
above and beyond it cannot just be like

308
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,880
yeah you're gonna see some talks like so

309
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,680
what

310
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,000
some new zero day yeah bro get in mine

311
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,399
zero days every day to watch online

312
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,760
just just

313
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,399
read read the white paper

314
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,600
yeah read the white paper you know what

315
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
i mean i do like you don't need to see

316
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,880
on stage you're not going to see banabi

317
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,880
jack level kind of things anymore people

318
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,279
have stopped doing that man they

319
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,519
probably are no more excited yeah people

320
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,800
grew up there's no more exciting talks

321
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,640
right people come and they have some

322
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,160
cool name but the cool name is not going

323
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,160
to wait for the conference for them to

324
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,000
drop the presentation because

325
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,760
it's a business they need to make money

326
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,600
from the exploit from the whatever the

327
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,839
hell they found the white paper or

328
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,920
methodology whatever they release it now

329
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,120
not wait for the conference they might

330
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,240
talk about it at the conference and

331
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,519
recap but they would have already

332
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,760
released the white paper in advance

333
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,200
there's no excitement you know what i

334
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,600
mean a lot of the times even the big

335
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,000
presentations i will explain why why

336
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,560
there is no excitement because technical

337
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,839
people

338
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,079
struggle with deliver

339
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,600
content really well we are not actors we

340
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
we not we're not gonna ever present

341
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,959
things in vegas in oh wait a second we

342
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,120
actually have uh

343
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,320
because

344
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,920
it's rather easier to go and read white

345
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,800
paper to understand what's going on or

346
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,720
read an article from a well-known

347
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,720
journalist that will be able to put

348
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,880
things in a narrative

349
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,639
than to sit and listen uh so i was at

350
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,920
newcom berlin a few months ago

351
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,160
and i seem i will let you talk about

352
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,920
that just like in a minute

353
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,800
but

354
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,000
i i

355
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,440
i sit there

356
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,200
and i see

357
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,480
all these people that doing amazing

358
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,639
technical stuff i will never be able to

359
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,440
do in my life but they struggle to

360
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,399
deliver the idea they struggle to keep

361
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,600
the audience engaged even in 45 minutes

362
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,279
slot i understand that the current

363
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,519
teenagers have a 15 minute span of

364
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,880
attention but still you you can you can

365
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,200
create an amazing story there were guys

366
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,760
from korea i believe who was sharing the

367
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,880
story how to hack metaverse uh setups

368
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,800
like different metaverse pieces of

369
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,120
hardware software in the end what i've

370
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,120
realized metavirus is just normal web

371
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,639
application

372
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,279
to be honest yeah but but but but the

373
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,680
story would be amazing and they were

374
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,519
like obviously they were not their

375
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,440
native speakers english was not a native

376
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,959
language but it's still it's so bad yeah

377
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,519
like and and that's why

378
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,320
again there is no point coming spending

379
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,040
all money to sit there and listen on

380
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,000
this mumbling and jumbling if you can go

381
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,240
and read the paper or or read the

382
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,839
article or

383
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,120
like

384
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,880
listen it in recording at least if you

385
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,959
want to hear the original original is

386
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,880
always good because it's much better to

387
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,440
get the knowledge of the actual author

388
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,600
or the research but just watch it in

389
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,120
video yeah

390
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,040
i mean i would say that only sorry to

391
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,880
kind of assume before he gets started i

392
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,519
would say the only reason right to go is

393
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,360
not so much to listen to the talk but is

394
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,519
to meet the author

395
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,440
to meet the presenter

396
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,880
that is something that you cannot do

397
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,959
from the white paper and usually the

398
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,240
email address will bounce or some

399
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,000
or they just never read it so

400
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,040
if you

401
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,560
you go to the conference to meet the

402
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,320
presenter you don't go to the conference

403
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,560
to listen to the presentation

404
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,760
that's the thing that people have

405
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,440
forgotten about it's like nobody's not

406
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,760
flying about the paper bro

407
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,279
right i want to know what this guy is

408
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,079
working on okay well meet and then what

409
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,680
ask ask ask for a signature

410
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,880
question

411
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,399
maybe she has some exploits that i need

412
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,920
to buy from you i want to sell to you or

413
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,040
whatever the hell it might be man

414
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,560
opportunities right like usually there

415
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,920
might be something i'm stuck with maybe

416
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,440
you have some idea on how to fix it or

417
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,040
how how to solve it you're the banking

418
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,639
guy for example right if i'm if i'm

419
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,639
trying to pack some banking thing who

420
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,800
would i ask you

421
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,519
obviously so you know it's kind of like

422
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,199
for that right it'd be easier if i just

423
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,800
met you buy you a beer and say like can

424

i mean i i was i was going to say the

429
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,639
same thing i mean you if you're going to

430
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,120
a conference you're not going to

431
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,959
you know just sit down and listen to the

432
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,040
talk you're actually going to

433
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,120
you know to meet the the author and the

434
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,720
presenter because

435
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,480
and as as uh

436
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,920
didn't mention the reasons could be

437
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,560
varied maybe you want to buy stuff from

438
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,920
him maybe you're working on the same

439
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,360
problem right

440
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,120
um and uh

441
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,279
you you're stuck in a roadblock so you

442
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,279
go ask him how is he making these

443
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,040
changes and all

444
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,320
and

445
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,959
from the

446
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,959
last team cool

447
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,720
yeah i think i assumed

448
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,040
oh no

449
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,680
he got to he got to the point of like

450
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,760
the actual concert in the question and

451
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,800
they cut it off the government

452
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,399
it must be conspiracy conspiracy

453
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,519
yeah i mean

454
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,519
also job opportunities right i mean if

455
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,360
you know somebody who's working in

456
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,800
i don't know

457
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,440
uh whatever project zero let's just give

458
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,440
an example right like trying to get into

459
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,560
zero via the like normal route forget

460
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,720
about it dude it's just not gonna happen

461
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,040
but like if you wanted to if that's your

462
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,800
goal it's in like you know your dream if

463
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,079
you're a young researcher and you're

464
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,920
like man you know if i was part of

465
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,160
project zero i'd be like

466
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,079
i made it whatever it is that floats

467
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,560
your vote right the fastest you need to

468
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,480
approach them on the stage and say hey

469
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,399
can i have a job or what

470
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,120
no but it's more of like hey i've got

471
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,959
research that i think is worthy of

472
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,519
project zero can you take a read can you

473
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,560
take a look

474
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,399
and if it's not worthy or if you think

475
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,320
that my you know maybe the research area

476
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,839
that i'm working on is it something

477
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,120
interesting for project zero what are

478
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,199
you guys researching on i'm sure they

479
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,880
they're you know fuzzing all

480
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,399
sorts of crazy

481
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,639
and so maybe they might look for people

482
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,959
who are fuzzing lua or some crazy crap

483
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,320
you know what i mean

484
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,920
so but there's no difference if they

485
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,560
will approach them via email right

486
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,560

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,319
yes yes

506
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,439
yeah so uh i i we faced pretty much the

507
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,799
same things from the conference

508
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,119
perspective uh so one of the major

509
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,439
decisions that we took for nalcon was

510
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,559
that we moved the gowa conference to

511
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,959
end of the year september and we decided

512
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,520
to go ahead and do one in europe

513
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,199
this was a major decision and part of

514
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,640
the reason was because of the

515
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,319
uncertainty and we were seeing that

516
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,480
europe was opening up

517
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,400
so when we decided

518
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,960
we finalized we publish everything and

519
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,400
then we see the

520
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
the number of cases in india going down

521
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,080
and the number of cases in germany are

522
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,320
increasing and again the same thing

523
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,320
there's no surety the rules keep on

524
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,520
changing

525
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,120
but i think

526
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,440
we were we were very lucky because

527
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,919
things started to cool down and before

528
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,280
the conference and

529
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,960
you know they were

530
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,679
they were finally we had rules where

531
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,240
you could go to a conference without

532
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,240
there was no cap on number of people and

533
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,400
you could you know remove your mass so

534
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,440
not not have mass in in public

535
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,280
but on the online side

536
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,120
i think we didn't work on the uh on the

537
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,400
you know

538
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,559
online plus uh offline mode of the

539
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,520
conference we stuck to uh offline

540
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,760
and i think it's just another year as

541
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,440
dylan mentioned things are going to go

542
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,760
back so

543
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,880
there's there's already too much

544
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,600
overload of online stuff like webinars

545
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,200
and conference i mean

546
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,400
even if it is good i will still

547
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,720
not prefer to you know sit down for the

548
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,720
webinar or the conference because the

549
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,640
whole aim of the conference is to go and

550
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,480
meet people right whether it's the

551
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,400
author whether it's you know uh

552
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,919
companies or

553
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:48,640
or

554
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,120
depending on uh what your aim is you

555
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,919
know

556
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,160
just exposure networking yeah yes yes uh

557
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,039
so in fact yeah the the guys from

558
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,240
payattu

559
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,120
uh

560
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,120
nilcon hardware.io they probably

561
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,760
had the biggest challenge

562
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,320
but they decided to make themselves of

563
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,080
just moving the conference to completely

564
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,200
new location yeah in new country in new

565
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,799
content well this is

566
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:19,600
like

567
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,799
thousands of miles away not like city

568
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,360
within within your uh

569
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,919
country yeah and yeah i guess this is

570
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,520
this is the biggest challenge and it

571
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,640
really paid off yeah i've been at newcon

572
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,240
uh in in in berlin that's that's amazing

573
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,280
people talks were really really amazing

574
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,080
the the the conference the vibes yep i

575
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,240
mean the only ones in i personally miss

576
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,000
i miss goa

577
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,039
yeah uh so the second question is

578
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,200
what eager mentioned and i completely

579
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,679
agree and you all probably agree on that

580
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,320
is like we see

581
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,440
less and less connections

582
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,320
between cybersec conferences and what's

583
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,880
happening in the reality

584
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,919
uh

585
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,799
does that mean that conferences

586
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,360
exhausted themselves that like ccc

587
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,720
defcon we got these wipes 20 years ago

588
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,400
30 years ago

589
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,120
and now eventually it it it lost

590
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,200
the essence because because people are

591
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,559
like they just go and do their like

592
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,679
hackathon or comic con yeah just like go

593
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,280
see people collaborate but there is

594
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,679
nothing to do with the reality nothing

595
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,600
to do with the threadscape nothing to do

596
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,640
with the

597
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,799
uh

598
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,440
whatever but but i mean the the i would

599
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,159
say that the only thing i can think of

600
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,520
before i even start uh asking questions

601
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,440
yeah exactly what you guys said at least

602
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,520
you can go and meet brands you can go

603
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,280
and talk to people they're still

604
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,840
grounded this use this is the only

605
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,960
connection i can think of but but like

606
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,960
okay hacking metaverse how many people

607
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,880
gonna go and hack metaverse how many

608
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,720
people can go and do things other people

609
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,360
doing like what what do you think

610
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,360
what is the future of the company you're

611
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,440
telling the cyber crime right like the

612
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,159
reality no not only cyber crime but

613
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,039
white hacking black hacking

614
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,960
any kind of hacking

615
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,360
word with between us as friends is

616
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,600
compliance i think when conferences

617
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,799
started to do sponsorships compliance

618
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,640
and governments and everything you have

619
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,480
to have a very

620
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,039
thin line between what the black hat

621
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,799
real stuff in the beginning in the early

622
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,720
years i think in the early years the

623
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,000
conference like dilo mentioned is like

624
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,640
what 22 years you said or like so many

625
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,280
years in the beginning every there was

626
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,440
like a community and that community i'm

627
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,960
sure in the beginning

628
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,559
was divided there were like some people

629
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,640
crossing the lines and you know at least

630
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,080
when i was lives were different the

631
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,840
reliance the problems there's so many

632
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,080
lines so many like like this is the

633
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,320
light i don't know this yeah exactly

634
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,559
people were stepping from lines to lines

635
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,240
and now conference is not they're

636
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,480
disconnected conferences had to

637
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,000
make it look legal

638
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,600
uh they made ctfs they made uh speakers

639
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,200
and academic people

640
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,039
uh do their researches in demo

641
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,240
environments

642
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,440
nothing is

643
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,799
real production

644
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,799
everything is like aligned

645
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,840
to be in that sort of way

646
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,000
is other conferences for that that talk

647
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
about compliance info security of course

648
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,960
eu

649
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,720
like pci

650
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,480
i don't know something something just

651
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,320
from my point of view

652
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,120
in some part we get lost and we just you

653
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,720
send exhausted

654
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,640
maybe not exhausted but maybe you just

655
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,480
follow the trend

656
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,120
and the trend is i don't know why

657
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,799
it's like business

658
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,120
yeah business first and and it's not

659
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,400
very

660
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,640
it looks like you're talking about some

661
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,080
illegal stuff

662
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,840
so everybody stays away from that it's

663
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,440
like no no no don't talk about that

664
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,159
stuff we are not here for that everybody

665
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,320
gets you know i don't know i

666
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,159
i think it's about

667
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,520
compliance

668
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,520
that's my point right okay

669
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,440
i don't know what our friends think

670
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,520
about

671
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,918
dylan

672
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,000
yeah

673
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
why isn't anybody presenting any cool

674
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,600
 like what's actually happening in

675
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,600
the underground was that your question

676
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,720
yeah no the question is

677
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,240
we do you feel like hug the box

678
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,159
presentations and the conference itself

679
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,760
for the box

680
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,919
especially yeah like cyber week

681
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,120
don't have any connection with the real

682
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,159
hacking

683
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,320
whatsoever

684
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,240
is like is that

685
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,400
is that where you were going to stick

686
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,080
for the next 10 years this is going to

687
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,000
be cyber conferences for the next 10

688
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,760
years or we're going to have this

689
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,919
groundbreaking hacking back in the day

690
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,799
you've mentioned barnaby jack yeah is it

691
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,960
is it going to be anything like that or

692
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,760
or not anymore or not in our generation

693
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,600
and we'll have to have a next generation

694
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,559
to come up and step in or what

695
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,880
i have a feeling that uh so it's not so

696
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,320
much that we

697
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,159
we chose it to be like this right as in

698
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,640
in the early days we had pirate bay

699
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,679
we had you know wikileaks

700
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,240
i mean hd more i mean if i go back even

701
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,840
further like you know there's

702
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,840
lots of people that came about and i

703
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,760
presented some crazy basically and

704
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,000
it was awesome because there was a

705
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,919
actually a community not as an industry

706
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,919
growth that's the main difference

707
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,840
there was no security industry you know

708
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,520
i mean there was commercial guys there

709
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,919
was government and officers

710
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,760
the hackers it's the congress

711
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,440
it's just a column here

712
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,039
it's just kind of like how the things

713
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,200
evolve right i mean it's unfortunate and

714
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,960
i mean it's pros and cons right as in

715
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,960
it's not like everything is up

716
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,919
you know what i mean it's because

717
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,200
there's no community the community

718
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,120
evolved listen it's changed

719
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,880
there's still a community but it's more

720
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,400
that people have

721
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,840
have jobs you know they have vested

722
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,279
interests they have career that they

723
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,720
want to plan for right they don't just

724
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,400
throw that away by like you

725
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,240
know dropping some

726
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,320
crazy ass stuff without doing it

727
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,400
responsibly or coordinatedly whatever

728
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,080
the hell the new term politically

729
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,760
correct them for you know not being an

730
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,760
 yes

731
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,120
but um

732
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,640
yeah there's a disconnect because

733
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,159
there's the underground which is still

734
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,000
going to be doing undergroundish kind of

735
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,200
things as in

736
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,200
whatever it takes to make money right if

737
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,360
that means ripping off all people and

738
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,799
installing malware on their computer

739
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,000
like i don't even man i want to

740
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,200
make money

741
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,600
and so you can't present about that

742
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,279
you know

743
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,200
you can't present about what that like

744
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,039
you know you can talk about maybe

745
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,799
hunting them as in but that's not as

746
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,640
exciting as actually like hey check this

747
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,159
out man i own a botnet with like you

748
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,240
know 500 million nodes or

749
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,400
something like that right i mean

750
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,919
check out how i built this botnet and

751
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,679
stuff like ain't nobody gonna talk about

752
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,679
that man like how they managed to do it

753
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,760
how they maintain it how they call cnc

754
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,520
controls like nobody's why why would

755
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,720
they do that they're going to like you

756
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,039
know help their adversary

757
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:01,840
and

758
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,520
their adversaries as in their

759
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,960
underground groups are competing for

760
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,240
each other for like trying to secure the

761
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,000
end points right because it's the way to

762
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,600
distribute malware it's the way to

763
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,880
whatever the hell you know do your

764
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,799
phishing campaigns do your click

765
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,240
crap for like

766
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,840
you know facebook

767
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,000
ads and making people you know think

768
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,080
differently all of that stuff right like

769
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,600
you need control of all these endpoints

770
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,480
right

771
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,400
so nobody's going to talk about that

772
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,400
that's just ridiculous to expect that

773
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,440
somebody's going to come and talk about

774
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,600
that because there's no there's no

775
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,039
reason for them to do so number one it

776
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,159
would be like exposing themselves to

777
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,520
crime which is like ain't nobody going

778
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,200
to go to jail and number two will be

779
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,880
giving up methodology techniques and

780
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,640
stuff that they've worked for years to

781
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,440
hold

782
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,039
right the underground didn't buy this

783
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,880
 for cheap man

784
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,320
right

785
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,919
so yeah

786
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,520
you're you're asking for something that

787
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,640
it's obviously not going to happen

788
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,120
because the there wasn't an industry the

789
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,840
last time exploits for zero days didn't

790
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,080
have a value nobody gave a it's

791
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,240
like so what you can hack some phones

792
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,840
like oh wow i can install my own

793
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,159
software on this man i can customize it

794
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,159
let me give a like jailbreak so

795
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,720
what what about jailbreak screw it but

796
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,640
now your banking is on it right now like

797
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,159
your entire life is on it i jailbreak

798
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,240
that if i can put a memory implant

799
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,799
into it that that can survive a reboot

800
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,840
whoa

801
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,640
awesome sauce man right

802
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,720
that's worth money i'm not going to

803
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,080
present in a conference come on

804
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,520
i've seen what's going on yeah there's

805
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,000
no agree i agree with yeah i agree with

806
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,799
the

807
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,480
intelligent so

808
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,279
so the way i see conferences is as as a

809
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,520
source of inspiration so they may not be

810
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,919
directly something that would lead to

811
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:40,880
you know

812
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,240
uh

813
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,000
the underground coming up with something

814
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,760
but it's more of a

815
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,000
more of an inspiration that you know

816
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,760
somebody comes up and says hey i found

817
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,000
this methodology to do this see how neat

818
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,880
it is

819
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,279
and that becomes an inspiration for you

820
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,039
know black hat gray hat white hat

821
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,440
whoever whichever hat the person is to

822
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,799
develop something

823
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:05,039
and how they want to use it and uh

824
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,240
and as as dylan mentioned unfortunately

825
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,919
unfortunately this has become an

826
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,679
industry and there are a lot of things

827
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,320
that have uh attributed to this i think

828
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,480
i see bug bounty as you know one of the

829
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,960
major game changers in terms of

830
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,760
changing the whole community aspect into

831
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,360
a fully blown industry where

832
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,960
you know

833
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,919
young folks are more inclined towards

834
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:32,240
you know finding an exercise and putting

835
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,640
it in their resume saying as

836
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,440
i i you know i found this vulnerability

837
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,240
and i'm a bug bounty hunter and stuff so

838
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,520
i and and

839
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,520
and people are getting paid for

840
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,600
these things so why waste your time and

841
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,440
energy on something else over there

842
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,440
and in

843
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,880
in terms of

844
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,120
people who are okay to work alone it is

845
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,360
fine but that's not how humans work

846
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,679
right we are a community and we will

847
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,559
always remain a community whatever the

848
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,480
community is whether it is cyber

849
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,039
security or hunting community or you

850
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,520
know i i don't know you know

851
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,440
banking community whatever

852
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,399
we we need a community to to survive so

853
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,360
you can work on it solo for a long time

854
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,480
uh but eventually you will need you know

855
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,279
uh

856
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,679
to fall back on some some kind of uh

857
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,360
community and that's where

858
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,000
the uh the conferences play a key role

859
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,679
so they will be there

860
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,600
depends on how the industry shapes up

861
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,159
they may or may not be too much fun in

862
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:37,600
the future

863
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,760
but they will still be there for people

864
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,320
who value community

865
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,000
yeah that that's my take on it i want

866
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,240
just to tell me one thing and to the

867
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,080
rest uh

868
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,399
there are underground conferences

869
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,159
i'm sure you guys know

870
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,600
uh plenty

871
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,480
and they're still running and i'm seeing

872
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,760
this trend of

873
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,240
not giving the location not giving

874
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,919
people like conferences around there

875
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,399
also building on a low profile

876
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,600
not

877
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,760
sponsoring hey guys we have this super

878
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,679
underground conference come come and

879
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,520
join us so

880
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,039
i don't know i don't know i think some

881
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,880
people go to there because i'm trying to

882
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,679
think

883
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,240
and speaking while i'm i'm thinking

884
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,960
they maybe the profile of red teamers

885
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,559
offensive hacking

886
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,640
i think they have more value to be in a

887
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,760
community

888
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,000
which is more towards this one

889
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,399
and the other full-blown industry in

890
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,880
ours conferences i don't know i'm just

891
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,480
thinking like why if they exist and

892
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,039
there's a trend somebody

893
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,640
wants them to exist and needs this

894
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,880
community the same thing i think but

895
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,159
again because

896
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,960
it's also business yes as much as our

897
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,600
business well our is multi-billion

898
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,840
theirs

899
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,200
is no but they're trying not to do

900
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,039
business around it they're just meet

901
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,200
friends

902
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,279
yeah of course but the old days was like

903
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,600
look this thing i hacked

904
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,760
and they just show you the laptop

905
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,919
remember those days it was like and

906
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:05,919
something exploits yes

907
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,679
and change exploits and all this stuff

908
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,760
this is happening it's not something new

909
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,880
so i think

910
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,440
that thing is getting more and more

911
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,679
underground thing just

912
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,480
very far from our industry and and it's

913
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,679
in parallel worlds i think they're

914
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,159
talking about stuff that maybe we

915
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,559
disconnected a little bit status quo has

916
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,799
changed status quo now is that cyber

917
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,279
criminal is just a criminal yeah 30

918
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,640
years ago it was it was um

919
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,440
is he is he a criminal is that is that

920
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,679
because there is no special law on that

921
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,799
now there is and now the

922
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,559
establish it's a witch hunting the

923
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,880
establishment thinks hey

924
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,840
if you violate the cyber cyber law you

925
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,519
go to jail

926
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,600
yeah if if the

927
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,720
well that's that's the problem

928
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,840
um

929
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,480
so the last question

930
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,519
new trends yeah like what is ahead of us

931
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,720
because

932
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,600
what i was really fascinated about

933
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,640
is

934
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,159
uh again

935
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,080
nukon i believe

936
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,840
ah no that was cyber week abu dhabi

937
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,240
uh

938
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,880
2017 or 18 before even before the covet

939
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,840
uh adam laurie

940
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,880
started making this radio

941
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,240
hacking

942
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,919
uh challenge remote when he had his dr

943
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,279
and it was translating the radio signal

944
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,240
from somewhere at his home in england

945
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,320
and he was doing the challenge there in

946
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,279
abu dhabi using the software

947
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,720
the sdr and network and sending this all

948
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,760
the way through now we have can kids

949
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,440
where back in the day

950
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,840
you need to bring tesla and

951
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,399
expensive cars on the venues now

952
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,760
the can kit fits in three suitcases the

953
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,640
same with ics stuff the same with

954
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,159
expliot

955
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,760
all these kids are now go and join and

956
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,880
i'm

957
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,960
like i started doing the same things

958
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,399
around payments yeah like online atms

959
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,039
special network setup that shows the

960
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,799
card payment attacks over the network

961
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,600
all things like that what what is really

962
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,480
fascinated you maybe what you're gonna

963
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,279
pick up on new trends because you i know

964
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,000
you you you're a big fan of ctf attack

965
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,320
defense you wanna you wanna it's always

966
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,919
been niche yeah we have done attack

967
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,080
defense for years but it's it's always

968
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,440
been niche so any any anything that guys

969
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,000
excites you well if you guys i start i'm

970
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,600
getting in this attack defense i want to

971
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,080
learn more about it because we're still

972
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,120
basic in that field we were jeopardy ctf

973
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,640
for me i think ctf is the it still

974
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,320
is relevant

975
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,799
and if you make something cool around it

976
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,399
it will really bring the tension that we

977
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:02,559
were speaking about like why should i

978
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,399
care to go there

979
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,080
of course you can do hdr remote and you

980
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,239
can do ctf remote everything can be

981
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,599
remote but some things are better to

982
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,918
touch and feel and talk with people so i

983
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,918
had the photos of people who called

984
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,159
yesterday to moscow of course buying

985
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,239
food in the supermarkets and i

986
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,320
remembered how we were doing the same in

987
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,918
2007

988
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:24,879
like

989
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,560
stocking up before the night of the

990
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,520
hardcore hacking no sleep things like

991
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,440
that yeah because there's some things in

992
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,599
remote you cannot recreate but yeah the

993
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,520
trend i think is just to

994
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,480
be creative i i think that's the biggest

995
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,879
thing at least my head is always

996
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,480
trying to be creative trying to be

997
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,040
something new because it's content

998
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,639
what was the most creative things you've

999
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,760
come up with

1000
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,199
i don't know some crazy stuff that

1001
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,280
didn't work that's the problem like you

1002
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,599
start thinking in your head yes i want

1003
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,680
to do this we wanted to do a weather

1004
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,079
balloon that would go really you know

1005
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,839
throw it in the air but we didn't get

1006
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:02,960
the permission from the airspace

1007
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,800
controller we wanted to do something

1008
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,119
with the sdr we were doing i remember so

1009
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,599
you were putting a your logo on the

1010
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:13,119
built-in in in telerif uh we were we

1011
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,960
were spilling out a lot of things

1012
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,560
between all of us like can we do this

1013
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,079
can we do that bring them the atm

1014
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,280
did it happen

1015
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,280
well no we had to take the local one and

1016
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,599
that was a disaster then i was trying to

1017
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,640
bring the atm to tenerife that was also

1018
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,839
a disaster but

1019
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:33,280
experts brexit a bitcoin bitcoin so i

1020
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,200
don't know it's about

1021
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,119
people need bus

1022
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,320
right the bus

1023
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,200
be you that said bus hmm okay like it

1024
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,000
needs something

1025
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,079
to ring a bell to say oh i want to see

1026
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,760
the atm i want to see how it works i

1027
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,119
want to see it inside i want to touch it

1028
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,839
i want to play with sdr i never you know

1029
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,000
had interaction about it if you make

1030
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
this setup like you said mobile and you

1031
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,920
just put it in the conference people can

1032
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,839
interact with that much remember lock

1033
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,599
picking you just sit in a table and

1034
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,280
there was a you know person just

1035
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,200
explaining your lock picking you start

1036
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,200
opening locks and you're like wow yeah

1037
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,079
like 10 years ago maybe yeah

1038
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,160
yeah but new people are still

1039
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,480
always there will be new school trying

1040
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,320
noobs trying to get on board and we

1041
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,160
cannot forget about that because then we

1042
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,920
will just keep the whole

1043
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,920
situation i think well maybe not lock

1044
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,160
picking you do nfc hacking or whatever

1045
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,960
and that interferes with idea that

1046
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,200
business first yeah for many people for

1047
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,359
many conferences like okay businesses

1048
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,440
first let's do something established

1049
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,920
yeah we're like hey i come up with this

1050
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,079
gi genius idea i need a lot of money and

1051
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,240
it's it may not work yeah can you can

1052
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,079
you give me money who will say yes for

1053
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,320
me it doesn't work all the time but i

1054
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,440
mean there's a complete disconnect

1055
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,599
there's a commercial conference where

1056
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,440
they will not do this stuff and there's

1057
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,520
some that still have it in the heart

1058
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,280
right you still need to make money you

1059
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,119
still need to be a business but the core

1060
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,200
value is about hacking community and

1061
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,800
it's about talking about that stuff

1062
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,880
getting a beer i think that still needs

1063
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,839
to be there and if if you lose that

1064
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,560
magic it's i don't know i just make a

1065
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,280
security conference with suits and

1066
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,000
stay there and not do anything about it

1067
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,920
it's about creativity i think

1068
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,800
yeah

1069
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,640
you can call it asr you know it's like

1070
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,480
rsa in reverse it doesn't matter what

1071
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,000
you call it if it's just about the food

1072
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,520
brothers like yeah call it whatever the

1073
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,800
hell you want but you know i mean uh i i

1074
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,800
completely agree in the sense that the

1075
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,920
community

1076
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,760
and the whole reason to have conferences

1077
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,200
is

1078
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,440
while we think like i love picking who

1079
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,720
wants to learn that you know what i mean

1080
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,720
but at hanging the box in cyber week for

1081
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,839
example you see a lot of young

1082
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,440
people

1083
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,880
and students as well

1084
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,200
and you know there you look at their

1085
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,280
face and how much excitement and

1086
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,640
determination is the key and you feel

1087
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,280
there's hope yet for our security

1088
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,119
community it's not everybody it's not

1089
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,480
about like oh i want to sell exploits

1090
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,079
and stuff so of course like majority of

1091
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,839
people who have grown up but

1092
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,920
there are still folks or still kids uh

1093
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,599
the younger generation that are looking

1094
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,000
at these things and getting excited by

1095
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,880
by

1096
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,240
wow you know i can i this is a powerful

1097
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,560
thing to learn this hacking because it's

1098
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,400
not oh i know how to press this button

1099
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,680
or write this script whatever the hell

1100
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,119
it's not so much about that but it's

1101
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,040
that exploration of technology of like

1102
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,480
wanting to learn stuff even though it

1103
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,640
has no commercial bearing like we've got

1104
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,440
all sorts of villages in our

1105
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,400
i've seen uh many villagers in abu dhabi

1106
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,720
on cyber week this year that was amazing

1107
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,400
when everything was just set up i was

1108
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,200
like villagers villagers i was also one

1109
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,280
of the villagers and you also were yeah

1110
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,800
we had we had the oil factories being

1111
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,280
broken and things like that yeah so

1112
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,520
hands-on yeah the answer is hands-on

1113
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,359
something that excites

1114
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:54,800
the audience

1115
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,800
yes and excites yourself as in when even

1116
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,400
when you are organizing it right like

1117
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,240
just doing stages with thoughtful stuff

1118
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,000
it's not exciting right but i want to

1119
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,680
see that oil refinery thing i want to

1120
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,839
see the ctf in action you know i want to

1121
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,359
i'm not playing it but it's still

1122
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,359
enjoyable to see it and see other people

1123
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:10,960
enjoying it and there's a there's a

1124
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,640
satisfaction in being the organizer from

1125
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,000
that standing point you know what i mean

1126
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,240
it's like if you didn't organize it and

1127
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,000
you didn't put your effort and energy

1128
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,599
and heart into making this something

1129
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,839
special these dudes that showed up

1130
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,920
wouldn't have this experience and

1131
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,440
there's value to that it might not have

1132
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,359
a dollar value but

1133
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:28,880
you're not born to make money right

1134
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,800
you're born to have experiences to make

1135
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,480
your life meaningful because if you die

1136
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,160
tomorrow your bank balance means

1137
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,560
all bro it means all

1138
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,079
it's like how many people did you touch

1139
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,760
how many lives did you change you know

1140
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,359
how many people came to your event and

1141
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,599
met somebody and because of that meeting

1142
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,079
like their lives are no longer the same

1143
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,680
if you didn't organize that conference

1144
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,440
they would not have met

1145
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,200
if i'm gonna die tomorrow no one will

1146
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,640
notice they will no one will notice well

1147
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,400
will remember me as a guy

1148
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,599
who who brought the atm to the hacker

1149
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:00,960
or cyber ring

1150
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,960
are you joking oh it's dylan just

1151
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,240
mentioned this point and this is the

1152
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,280
most important i met kids who said igor

1153
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,160
i found my first job in cyber security

1154
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,079
thanks to the conference

1155
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,000
and that's the point and that's one of

1156
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,680
the points the other point is business

1157
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,680
yeah we made business because we met

1158
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,920
this i don't know big company in their

1159
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,599
government's contract

1160
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,760
i don't know it's about connecting the

1161
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,160
dots and i mean and you just try to make

1162
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,200
the best

1163
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,960
i mean you you all know the company

1164
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,800
calls imperium right like

1165
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,319
luke abraham who is the founder of

1166
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,079
imperium and people now i don't know how

1167
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,839
many billion they got so far like they

1168
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,359
got like zack ops is another company he

1169
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,280
got like listed and

1170
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,520
he's he made it basically right

1171
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,680
i know zuk when he showed up and hang at

1172
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,760
the box and he had just this concept for

1173
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,280
this thing that he was going to present

1174
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,440
on stage in amsterdam and he was looking

1175
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,280
for ideas and inspiration and he wanted

1176
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,119
somebody to chat to and he was like so

1177
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,560
like you know really stressed out

1178
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,760
because it was his first time doing a

1179
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,000
presentation on stage like it's

1180
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,839
big conference you know and

1181
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,920
um look at where

1182
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,440
because of those opportunities and

1183
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,359
because he had that presentation and he

1184
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,440
met a lot of people in amsterdam and you

1185
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,839
know who knows what conversations were

1186
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,200
were had

1187
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,839
and where he ended up right right so you

1188
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:16,000
know everything has its place and no

1189
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,079
matter how big or how small right like

1190
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,440
you don't know how things are going to

1191
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,119
play out you might think that it's

1192
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,359
insignificant like so what you had a ctf

1193
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,760
that some 15 year old kid had a good

1194
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,960
time but you don't know what's going to

1195
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,880
happen to that 15 year old kid do you

1196
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,520
yeah so that's exactly my question what

1197
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,079
things inspired you what what new trends

1198
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,240
i seem

1199
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,680
yeah yeah so uh coming back to the

1200
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,440
original question about you mentioned

1201
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,000
about adam as well like making uh stuff

1202
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,960
remote

1203
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,680
so that was that was i think part of

1204
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,839
our learnings from covet where you had

1205
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,599
to do this

1206
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,200
so

1207
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,040
as we all know the saying necessity is

1208
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,760
the mother of uh all invention so we had

1209
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,520
to do something where people could not

1210
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,640
travel and people who were there uh we

1211
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,960
still needed to have something like

1212
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,839
radio challenges or hardware challenges

1213
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:08,640
and

1214
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,640
and and that's when you invent these

1215
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,280
things so for uh for 10 days it's the

1216
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,000
same experience yeah it's just that now

1217
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,720
uh instead of having everybody locally

1218
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,800
people can do it uh

1219
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,160
manage the the village or the ctf uh

1220
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,440
remotely as well um so i i remember when

1221
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,040
we started working on one of our

1222
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,880
products the iot auditor bit of

1223
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,119
shameless marketing here but

1224
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,359
one of the things that i wanted to do

1225
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,920
was to be able to give one device to a

1226
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,000
user where they could do some hardware

1227
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,760
stuff and radio stuff with the device

1228
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,359
but connected to the cloud and and and i

1229
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:48,400
think after six months uh covert hit and

1230
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,200
i didn't realize holy like if you

1231
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,240
have this

1232
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,680
you really do not have to go to the

1233
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,960
location you can just send it to the

1234
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,920
customer and they they can run it right

1235
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,200
so

1236
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,000
so we are enabling things but at the end

1237
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,040
we're still trying to do uh uh uh

1238
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,280
the same thing right people get the same

1239
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,920
experience what they want to do with the

1240
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,960
uh the ctfs you mentioned the

1241
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,000
the the villages in cyber week like

1242
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,240
there were villages after villages after

1243
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,599
uh villages

1244
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,599
and uh

1245
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,880
and

1246
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,920
there were people coming and uh and i

1247
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,119
think

1248
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,200
in in in our village as well there were

1249
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,319
people coming

1250
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,480
sitting and soldering on their own and i

1251
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,480
could you know

1252
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,560
see the happiness in their face you know

1253
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,480
because when you've not been out for so

1254
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,280
long and then you do the real

1255
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,359
and that's what is

1256
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,400
exciting for people

1257
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,839
yeah

1258
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,160
i know from my point of view just make

1259
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,560
new things don't stop just not

1260
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,400
get stuck in this trend because it's

1261
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,160
super easy to get stuck

1262
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,599
yeah that's that's the problem that's

1263
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,440
the problem back in the day we were

1264
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,640
doing things all over again and now we

1265
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,440
had the disruption the supply chain

1266
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,800
disruption and the that's what i was

1267
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,880
talking about exactly last year we need

1268
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,000
to use this as a boost for being more

1269
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,520
creative for creating stuff to cover up

1270
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,400
much broader audience without them being

1271
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,560
on the stage without them being

1272
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,520
in in in person yeah but but that's

1273
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,960
again that my you have only so much time

1274
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,960
in your life so instead of

1275
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,319
thinking of hey

1276
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,560
five years ago you would think how can i

1277
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,800
do something on defcon

1278
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,680
with people who gonna come and see me

1279
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,960
that they're gonna be excited this year

1280
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,520
i will be thinking how can i

1281
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,839
not go into defcon

1282
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:49,760
do exactly the same to cover much

1283
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,000
broader audience you see the focus is

1284
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,839
changing you have the tunnel vision and

1285
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:56,640
we may end up losing

1286
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,680
the innovation thinking about broader

1287
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,280
audience but not thinking about

1288
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,040
innovation that might be the problem but

1289
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,319
so far so good i really like

1290
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:08,880
all things that i've seen over the last

1291
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,760
years explored these

1292
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,160
amazing small boxes that i've seen was

1293
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,760
bringing guys on cyber week coming

1294
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,440
hacking things with their fingers and

1295
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,640
laptops

1296
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,720
