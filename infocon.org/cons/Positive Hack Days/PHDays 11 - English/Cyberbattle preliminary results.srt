by the way i would like to give you a

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,960
compliment

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,400
we together in the beginning of the day

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,039
we've been discussing what number of

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,200
inaccessibly and admissible unique

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,520
events and admissible unique events

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,000
our attackers can realize which number

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,239
you gave us 30. and you were right they

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,840
were able to achieve this number by the

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,520
way in the remaining hours and i don't

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,039
know how they've done it you know you

21
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,680
predicted it pretty well

22
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,719
well we have not been judging up no no

23
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,239
no we have not been helping them

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,000
irrespectively to the fact that we've

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,360
been together with the organizers we

26
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,120
have not been judging up as many they

27
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,440
got that's how many they've got you know

28
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,719
it's all

29
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,039
sudden yeah absolutely

30
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,280
by accident you know have they been

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,680
trying to pull somebody have the teams

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,840
been trying to

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,280
pull in

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,880
i don't know or whether it's possible to

35
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,320
lie to you

36
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,560
no listen of course

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,000
well it's almost impossible to lie

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,439
and i would like to say that event

39
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,280
number 31 was on the threshold of the

40
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,200
unique the guys from code by they were

41
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,640
able to replace the picture on the video

42
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,600
screen they were ready the video was

43
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,520
coming but they were not able to send

44
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,759
the report basically

45
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,799
this

46
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,560
is not possible even though they were

47
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,439
able to realize it you know the risk is

48
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,520
not considered without the report yes

49
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,720
it's not

50
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,280
oh my god what can we do about that

51
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,520
uh have they won have they won

52
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,079
yeah they have won you're spoilering

53
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,719
with the back efforts called by team has

54
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,799
won have they submitted all these

55
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,240
reports uh our defenders i don't know

56
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,000
what else was left for them in the stock

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,480
but until the final second they've been

58
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,959
sending reports of the risks which were

59
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,000
realized during the final minutes they

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,120
had very quickly investigated the risks

61
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,160
minimal time one hour and 13 minutes

62
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,640
zone zone team have been investigating

63
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,120
this risk on their object in one hour

64
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,840
and 13 minutes and was it a complicated

65
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,280
risk that they were in this year because

66
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,720
one hour is very little you know for

67
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,519
these guys yes it's not a lot and with

68
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,800
consideration

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,400
of the fact that the chain has several

70
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,120
steps our stock is really demanding from

71
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,720
the technic point of view

72
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,280
as you remember and make it in such a

73
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,720
way so that they would accept this

74
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,560
report in 1 hour and 13 minutes you know

75
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,560
it's almost a fantasy you know

76
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,680
anya

77
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,680
can you tell me please what are your

78
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,440
impressions from today's standoff from

79
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,360
the final one of course all the

80
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,519
organizers are really happy

81
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,319
they breath out you know they you know

82
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,840
taking their out and you know we're

83
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,000
happy that we're able to realize how can

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,480
we realize inadmissible event in the

85
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,000
industrial one and alexis was speaking

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,959
about it you know i'm sorry about it

87
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,760
stoppage of the oil production facility

88
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,560
yeah that was really cool and you know

89
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,879
the same it was stoppage of not only the

90
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:27,920
oil

91
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,480
but also the airport

92
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,959
uh fueling station everything was shut

93
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,080
down and visitors in airports are

94
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,720
sitting they cannot fly away

95
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,879
oh my god this is a full collapse we're

96
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,560
happy that it happened it was an

97
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,720
objective of the standoff into

98
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,799
industrial risks oh my god alec tell me

99
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,360
please about uh attack teams because

100
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,920
you've been following them you know i'm

101
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,920
confident that you're following them and

102
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,958
we are behind

103
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,840
place from the them place through earth

104
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,799
second place uh through oxford yes

105
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,840
throughout the second place last year

106
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,760
they've been first

107
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,319
every year they are competing with the

108
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,360
code by and for them this is a long

109
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,238
story and as i know guys from this team

110
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,600
they've been telling us that they've

111
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,440
been one step away from realization of

112
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,000
invisible events which

113
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,720
has brought them a lot of points and uh

114
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,479
they had a big uh strength for the next

115
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,040
year you know to do it that's why we're

116
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,680
waiting them next year you prohibit them

117
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,639
to play the king of the mountain the

118
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,720
king of the hill but they decided to

119
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,040
play the king of the hill they are doing

120
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,160
it completely tell me please

121
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,360
was there an intrigue when they've been

122
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,680
moving around each other they've been

123
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,720
making bets for the winners

124
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,560
well we should make bets what do you

125
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,080
mean you shouldn't make any bets you

126
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,800
know

127
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,600
it's a conflict of interest you are not

128
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,120
judging them up you know you have

129
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,759
formulator formulated differently is

130
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,120
there an attack theme from which you did

131
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,080
expect wow effect

132
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,520
well honestly speaking i really like

133
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,960
the way

134
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,479
how they

135
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,960
in books teams are developing into the

136
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,639
third place the one which stands on the

137
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,120
turquoise because from year to year they

138
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,919
are accumulating the and the future of

139
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,880
standoff they are really good they

140
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,759
understand how this game is

141
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,479
working they can give a good competition

142
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,479
they can become a leader for the code by

143
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,800
do you have any favorite ones

144
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,600
well

145
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,240
we have an international team uh began

146
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,400
the bay and we really wanted for them to

147
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,720
realize some inadmissible events but as

148
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,680
alex said we should be

149
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,360
we should judge honestly and they were

150
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,600
able to do that you know three or four

151
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,880
were realized you know wonderful

152
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,440
alex what about your guys well i really

153
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,000
liked the way how the arena was

154
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,360
distributed cyber arena this time it did

155
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,240
happen that teams through us and caught

156
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,560
by practically they were competing

157
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,080
inside of the oil industry and on this

158
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,319
facility one after another they've been

159
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,479
realizing invisible events and the team

160
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,600
involved have selected for itself

161
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,000
city object and they've been playing

162
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,479
around in it so they've shared these

163
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,360
zones they've changed the speed of the

164
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,520
wheel and there was a risk that it will

165
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,840
uh run away and it will run around the

166
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,880
city

167
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,720
moving everything away from their path

168
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,880
well it sounds so awful

169
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,520
well don't they find an agreement

170
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,440
between you know the attackers how

171
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,199
they've replaced all of this well i

172
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,440
think the one who got the stronghold

173
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,680
faster they feel much better can you

174
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,400
remind me the story of the last year

175
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,919
it was called by and

176
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,840
through us last year they have been

177
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,400
studying the oil production

178
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,000
the gas industry yes

179
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,680
don't you remember last year in may or

180
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,479
november in november in november we had

181
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,840
a single state we had a single state big

182
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,880
one

183
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,080
and a different model of the game

184
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,840
that's why

185
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,039
it was very difficult to do that

186
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,280
and not so many days you know couple of

187
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,360
days we went for the realization of

188
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,840
invisible events in the scan and last

189
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,319
year we have completed everything and

190
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,520
the threshold when teams have approached

191
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,680
so what do you think three days in the

192
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,520
course of this year we had a standoff or

193
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,080
four days is it enough or not enough

194
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,919
don't tell it to me as organizers

195
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,199
they've been asking for more i

196
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,919
understand that you want for everything

197
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,240
to end up right now

198
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,919
yeah organizers have been asking for

199
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,160
less what about defenders defenders also

200
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,360
been asking for less

201
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,520
well the opinions have changed

202
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,080
two to one

203
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,199
i think everything will be less

204
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,120
i think many people want to play but

205
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,479
this time we didn't have it of course we

206
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,000
wanted to play

207
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,039
no

208
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,280
story

209
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,960
i think this is a ritual

210
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,520
previously was only two days

211
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,440
and in the framework of these phds it

212
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,360
always happens that we always started

213
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,960
from the beginning of the phds and then

214
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,479
it was ended by the end of the second

215
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,559
day and

216
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,679
the older guys they remember

217
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,839
and they dream about it

218
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,479
okay

219
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,279
well

220
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,560
i briefly will draw the line so in the

221
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,160
course of four days of competition

222
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,279
invisible events

223
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,440
non-admissible events were realized

224
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,720
check me

225
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,440
you're to be the first one 63 times

226
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,720
yes that's right

227
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,279
what about you you also have the

228
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,240
hint

229
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,560
yes we have similar hints the attacker

230
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,160
team have realized that 30 unique events

231
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,199
out of 100

232
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,920
and together with alex we have discussed

233
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,000
that he was expecting 30 out of 100 and

234
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,760
uh he thought that it was a norm how

235
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,240
many of them you wanted to see well

236
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,920
we've been expecting the same amount

237
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,000
it's a good result from hackers that

238
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,640
they have realized 30 percent from total

239
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,240
that was defined

240
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,240
and we will have something for the next

241
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,200
year or fourth of november

242
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,880
you have the same opinion

243
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,560
yes i agree

244
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,959
i agree i agree with everything that is

245
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,279
defined here and by the way last

246
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,440
november standoff attackers were able to

247
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,640
realize six unique events and by the way

248
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,800
it will compare six and 30 they step

249
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,519
forward and why do you think this number

250
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,640
happened you know the guy's more

251
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,120
experienced on there's a more of them

252
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,519
well like alexa there was a different

253
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,560
model

254
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,399
of game

255
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,279
we had a single

256
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,720
platformer state platform informational

257
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,120
system the vector of attack

258
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,839
was a single one from the beginning we

259
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,399
have to get through it and then every

260
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,640
office is separate that's why there's a

261
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,440
lot more five times more

262
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,519
so that's you can see in results six by

263
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,320
five thirty and thirty unique events so

264
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,399
it's much more dynamic and i think the

265
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,640
main dynamics was happening today we

266
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,200
started in the morning since sixteen

267
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,160
in the course of the day they've

268
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,399
realized three unique and admissible

269
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,000
events then eleven and today you should

270
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,880
not happen sixteen additionally the

271
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,680
demand yes

272
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,640
very dynamic dynamic and more dynamic

273
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,680
everyday three of you next year

274
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,640
right

275
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,680
yes

276
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,760
are you going to participate next year

277
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,000
yes we are going to participate next

278
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,839
year and they are getting ready they are

279
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,279
preparing we are ready

280
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,880
are we going to have any spoilers

281
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,480
well we are not going to have any

282
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,560
spoilers in the beginning we are going

283
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,320
to

284
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,000
evaluate the results of the previous

285
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,320
year and we are always helped

286
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,959
and then after this we are going to

287
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,680
think and analyze and will plan

288
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,519
infrastructure from the beginning that's

289
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,360
spoilers and i can tell you we are going

290
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,519
to develop new industries

291
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,399
so we are going to have the outer space

292
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,560
yes we will fly to the space yes and we

293
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,959
will put julia's desire in our book yeah

294
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,079
i will come with the pencil so will you

295

296
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,720
team

297

participate

299
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,600
in the monitoring of whatever happens at

300
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,360
this cyber field became a school

301
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,440
which must have should be done by

302
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,760
anybody except for new employees you

303
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,920
know guys are growing in front of our

304
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,399
eyes you know in the course of four days

305
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,240
let's say

306
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,320
several weeks of preparation and people

307
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,920
are going to the course of informational

308
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,279
security

309
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,920
which you will never do through 5 years

310
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,519
and you will be able to see everything

311
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,279
with your own eyes

312
