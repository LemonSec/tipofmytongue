1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
how to make those challenges

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,440
okay our next topic it's dev sec ops

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,600
what is devsecops

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,920
development which includes informational

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,360
security technology

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,600
we are going to speak with alex zhukov

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,000
the product management uh

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,359
manager for devsecops alexey bobenko

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,760
deputy head in the center of software

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,800
solutions for national system of payment

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,480
cards alexi hello

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,960
hello and vladimir kutchet the head of

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,320
department of the research and

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,719
development of the analyzer of positive

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,399
code okay let's begin with decoding of

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,879
these complicated

17
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,760
deaf sec ops

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,680
abbreviation what is what does it mean

19
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,559
alex you're going to be the first one me

20
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,280
all right it's very strange because i

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,800
will have an alternative point of view

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,460
on these devsecops

23
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,609
[Music]

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,559
everybody can google it but generally

25
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,360
speaking the approach what does it mean

26
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,880
to me

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,680
if in the beginning first of all it's a

28
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,680
methodology and approach

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,960
if devops approaches were serving us

30
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,600
in this modern fast-changing world to be

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,759
able to reduce time to market for

32
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,280
products

33
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,200
and we

34
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,000
could reduce the release cycle from very

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,920
extended period of time of several

36
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,720
months and reduce it down to one day so

37
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,720
that several times a day we could roll

38
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,560
out new software products and of course

39
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,040
for this paradigm the old security

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,439
paradigm so after you have changed

41
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,960
something in the software and right now

42
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,280
you also want to spend two weeks to

43
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,200
check it it doesn't work anymore so

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,119
right now we have to catch up with this

45
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,079
fast cycle and we should be able to

46
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,240
install the security so devsecops it's a

47
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,000
methodology and an attempt to provide

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,680
security

49
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,880
in a paradigm that we are really fast in

50
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,200
rolling out new releases with new

51
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,560
changes and modifications so this is my

52
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,878
internal feeling and vision of this

53
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,599
methodology

54
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,800
i think you have your own definition

55
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,440
well i think it's also a little bit

56
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,160
banded into my area of what i do

57
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,879
statistical analysis for me is the

58
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,239
automation of all

59
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,800
activities in the life cycle of the

60
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,720
software related with security

61
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,160
provisioning

62
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,840
not more not less

63
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,800
you have definition number three

64
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,120
definitely of course

65
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,040
it makes sense to be a little bit more

66
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,400
original okay let's see

67
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,640
explaining it in a simple way i would

68
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,560
like to say what was the beginning of

69
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,040
all of these because devsec ops story

70
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,280
it's a logical continuation of the story

71
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,200
with devops because a big number of

72
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,120
anecdotes and jokes about programmers

73
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,800
saying that well everything works on my

74
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,200
side but the problem is on your side so

75
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,640
uh

76
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,560
several years ago or maybe about 10

77
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,840
years ago

78
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,800
this story did happen

79
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,319
and there was a perception like well

80
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,640
everything works on my side try to see

81
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,000
why it doesn't work on the side of the

82
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,720
decline it's security but now

83
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,159
everybody's unhappy about it and right

84
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,159
now there's devops concept when they

85
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,319
have united development and deployment

86
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,200
process and assistance uh and management

87
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,200
and everything started working we

88
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,680
started seeing systems which orchestrate

89
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,680
everything try to connect one with

90
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,000
another and uh until recently

91
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,640
outside of all these topics

92
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,720
we still had a topic of informational

93
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,959
security involved informational security

94
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,280
was the headache for the security guys

95
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,280
of course in modern conditions when the

96
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,040
ratio between security guys and

97
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,439
developer guys in the quantitative

98
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,000
understanding is significantly different

99
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,560
uh it's very hard to cope with it so

100
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,680
devsecops is an attempt which

101
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,920
helps us to pull

102
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,000
these well recommended and confirmed

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,799
paradigm of devops on the topic of

104
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,040
informational security in order to make

105
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,358
application more reliable stable and

106
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,238
safe

107
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,918
it's not a secret that from the side of

108
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,720
developers there is a big skepticism uh

109
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,919
from the side of the people of

110
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,600
informational security they are not

111
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,120
letting them work

112
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,800
okay let's speak about it

113
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,240
what is the main reason for such

114
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,280
skepticism and is there any dynamics or

115
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,680
changes in this skepticism changing is

116
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,080
it reducing or maybe the skepticism is

117
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,800
growing uh yeah

118
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,639
well i can be the first one because this

119
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,479
is my favorite topic

120
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,880
the thing is that

121
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,800
i've been involved in security for quite

122
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,120
a while and last five years i've been on

123
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,040
the side of developers

124
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,400
and i did

125
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,040
feel this story with skepticism and

126
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,720
communication you know classical

127
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,919
security as i call it and development

128
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,440
i could feel it on myself

129
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,759
and here's a good example last year i've

130
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,360
been speaking something on another

131
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,880
conference and there was a question from

132
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,400
the audience well do your security guys

133
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,919
looking at the code yes of course up

134
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,880
second we say okay do they understand

135
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,360
this code i say okay guys

136
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,759
we have developers team we create their

137
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,320
own products of course they look at the

138
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,479
source code and for them it was a

139
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,639
surprise why does it happen like that

140
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,440
because unfortunately

141
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,440
very often top management and

142
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,120
informational security department is

143
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,000
looked upon as something separate uh

144
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,199
guys who are involved in like standards

145
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,560
accesses like physical security

146
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,280
native security but not

147
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,360
something related and lower level or

148
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,360
development related so in this paradigm

149
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,759
we see the situation that there are guys

150
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,199
who knows how it should be from the

151
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,600
legal point of view

152
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,639
and they come with a list of

153
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,000
requirements and they say okay do it

154
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,759
this way and there are developers who

155
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,080
understand nothing about legislation but

156
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,880
they understand the development but

157
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,720
uh sometimes there are no people who

158
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,639
understand both of these worlds and it's

159
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,319
very difficult for them to find common

160
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,840
agreement between themselves and

161
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,639
developers they don't want to learn

162
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,880
about legislation documents

163
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,039
and legal guys who are involved in paper

164
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,720
security they don't want to learn about

165
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,960
development because they don't care

166
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,000
about it

167
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,280
so unfortunately we have this gap in

168
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,280
this area and the main solution in our

169
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,400
case

170
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,319
it was created very simply we have a

171
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,880
department of product security upset

172
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,199
they do not belong to the management in

173
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,919
security they fully contained inside of

174
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,240
the development center

175
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,560
and for us providing security in a

176
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,280
development center we create a software

177
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,680
product they are of good quality and

178
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,520
they have uh different quality countries

179
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,880
they have to be reliable they have to be

180
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,240
multifunctional with full functionality

181
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,599
they have to be integrated with other

182
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,639
products

183
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,319
the load and security is one of the most

184
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,880
important characteristics of the

185
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,240
finished product

186
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,639
therefore security

187
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,680
is tested internally so at the output we

188
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,520
have a product which can work under the

189
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,520
load which is safe and which beautifully

190
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,919
works with all external products that's

191
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:30,720
it

192
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,039
and as a next step security management

193
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,280
with their own methods any other methods

194
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,039
can evaluate and estimate that all the

195
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,280
requirements are fulfilled in other

196
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,199
words

197
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,599
when security is in the development and

198
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,039
when the part of the development is here

199
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,639
then we don't have these capsules

200
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,800
skepticism but when two departments have

201
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,120
a constant distance with different goals

202
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,960
different interests and they speak in

203
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,800
different languages that's it okay

204
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,759
vladimir i have another question to you

205
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,879
the number of lines of code grows in

206
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,199
geometric progression especially right

207
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,080
now when we are developing more and more

208
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,240
of our own software the company develops

209
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,800
much more of it so how can we provide it

210
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,800
security

211
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,639
well as i think

212
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,720
security

213
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,240
of applications which are being

214
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,039
developed has to be provided by

215
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,759
everybody during all stages starting

216
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,680
from architectural planning when the

217
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,680
code is not available at all

218
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,559
we need to pre-define certain concepts

219
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,958
there which on top of this architecture

220
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,679
will allow us to write acceptably safe

221
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,919
code and of course ending up with

222
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,599
deployment because we have the same

223
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,519
principle of safe development

224
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,800
secure by design secure by design by

225
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,399
development by deployment therefore

226
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,760
by default the first one is by default

227
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,200
but the deployment

228
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,720
means

229
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,279
that the product at all the stages of

230
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,680
the development and exploitation should

231
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,279
by default be safe so that any person

232
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,640
could deploy

233
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,240
and at this moment of time it's not

234
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,000
going to be destroyed as soon as he does

235
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,040
it

236
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,279
so this is also a concept which means

237
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,480
that at all stages we should do it

238
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,120
on the stage of

239
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,160
quality testing

240
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,560
is good but security and testing nobody

241
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,959
cancels it and unfortunately right now

242
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,959
people do not perceive security and

243
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,720
testing as it was before the the

244
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
significance of testing is understood by

245
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,240
everybody because the objective of the

246
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,440
product

247
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,600
is realization of a certain features

248
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,360
which are going to

249
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,959
help uh some users

250
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,640
this is deadline of the developers

251
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,640
and they come to this deadline is going

252
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,000
to be good but as for the security

253
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,160
they are standing outside it has no

254
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,080
relation to the features and they can be

255
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,200
realized safely but it pushes deadlines

256
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,880
all the time because it takes certain

257
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,800
time you need to spend time for this and

258
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,680
this is why developers always have this

259
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,760
skepticism because a safety in their

260
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,760
understanding is something

261
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,959
that

262
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,959
makes them break deadlines

263
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,480
but i would like to tell you the

264
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,959
following ten years ago i had a very hot

265
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,959
argument with one of the top managers in

266
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,119
the development in third party company

267
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,560
and he had a phrase well my developers

268
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,360
are not paid for writing safe code if i

269
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,440
will tell them to write safe code they

270
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,079
will require higher salaries my argument

271
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,680
was a simple one

272
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,320
okay you don't pay them additionally to

273
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,839
uh write code without bugs why security

274
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,480
is so different from bugs same errors

275
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,640
but little different specifics not more

276
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,760
than that

277
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,399
so after 10 years after and it was so

278
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,399
many years we have this secure

279
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,640
development track in the course of many

280
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,320
years and guys are coming to me and

281
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,800
they're really happy younger and younger

282
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,200
guys coming to us as students and school

283
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,480
kids

284
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,360
and

285
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,800
elderly people

286
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,120
and most of them

287
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,399
are distributing the audience previously

288
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,880
we had more pen testers security guys

289
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,279
managers right now we have more

290
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,800
developers and developers are interested

291
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,800
in this topic and they want to get some

292
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,320
additional information they want to

293
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,200
learn

294
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,440
something so speaking about dynamics

295
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,800
everything moves to the better because

296
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,560
they understand that writing safe code

297
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,800
is the same as writing code without any

298
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,279
bugs and by default

299
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,079
there is a language in which you write

300
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,800
you can write with errors

301
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,120
with all of graphical errors you can

302
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,240
miss commas you can do some other things

303
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,240
it's not enough just to put right commas

304
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,079
and but you have to write proper words

305
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,399
inside of it but speaking what's going

306
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,200
to be the beginning some minimal set for

307
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,519
the safe development but the company or

308
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,800
specific developer tries to

309
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,160
make it his daily practice

310
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,680
what would you recommend well we have to

311
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,000
divide it into two main parts the first

312
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,079
part is the organizational part because

313
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,079
first of all people who are going to be

314
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,760
involved in development they should be

315
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,839
interested in this development because

316
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,279
when you come and say to the developer

317
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,680
into the team okay guys starting from

318
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,160
tomorrow uh from 2am you will start

319
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,040
writing safe code it will never work

320
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,880
the main topic here

321
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,360
is to find right people who are

322
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,880
interested in this

323
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,680
what

324
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,800
is incentivizes them what motivates them

325
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,639
this is different somebody will ask a

326
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,560
higher salary somebody will be

327
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,120
interested in this on the level of

328
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,480
you know being

329
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,639
awarded for this you know and saying

330
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,880
okay you see he's been writing such

331
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,639
interesting call some other people will

332
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,800
be interested to increase their value in

333
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,800
the market

334
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,480
administrative measures like you're

335
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,240
speaking about uh they have a department

336
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,480
with single set of goals and they by

337
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,480
default they use it in their work

338
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,240
definitely right so when we get this

339
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,399
live feedback when we receive this

340
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,639
feedback from developers because i'll

341
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,560
repeat it once again we cannot solve

342
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,040
safety security problems by the hands of

343
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,720
security guys and the ratio between

344
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,639
security guys and developer guys and

345
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,480
only guys i see one to 1500

346
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,480
one security guy and 150 developers so

347
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,399
as soon as this situation will change as

348
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,839
soon as we will understand that the

349
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,360
dialogue has been built with developers

350
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,920
then we can go to the technical details

351
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,320
we can have technical means which will

352
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,199
analyze code we'll make them pen tests

353
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,199
we'll teach them safe development and

354
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,440
work with documentation etc etc etc

355
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,440
increase their awareness from this point

356
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,000
of view and then everything then we can

357
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,040
hope for some good future

358
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,360
well right now i would like to clear the

359
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,480
approaches to the code analysis what are

360
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,360
they

361
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,279
and how would you divide them in

362
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,720
different classes and types

363
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,639
well vladimir i gonna begin

364
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,480
first of all there's a lot of criteria

365
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,160
by which you can divide them but first

366
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,880
of all it's the automated manual one

367
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,880
either there's a person who reads the

368
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,639
code and makes the review of this code

369
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,040
and this is a normal standard practice

370
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,760
even irrespectively to security to have

371
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,560
independent review with the second third

372
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,639
and fourth person for some changes which

373
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,639
are put into repository

374
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,639
that's topic number one topic number two

375
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,160
is the automation but in here it can be

376
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,040
implemented on the stage earlier stage

377
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,839
when a person just writes the code so if

378
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,760
for example

379
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,160
his development environment will

380
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,079
discover some security bugs

381
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,279
even on the stage when

382
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,079
repository change requests didn't come

383
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,920
for the vulnerable code we will know

384
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,920
that it's vulnerable and it has to be

385
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,440
fixed

386
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,720
as for

387
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,800
this part which is related to the

388
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,079
automation

389
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,320
it can be divided for quite period of

390
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,839
time because there are different classes

391
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,320
statistical analysis dynamical analysis

392
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,959
uh white box black box phasing and many

393
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,040
other different techniques and different

394
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,600
if different differently efficient

395
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,120
techniques and from the realities of

396
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,199
specific project

397
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,000
in order to stop on some set of tools

398
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,959
okay basically it's something like that

399
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,199
what else well i would like to make

400
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,600
emphasis on the following

401
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,560
any

402
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,680
methods

403
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,480
any approach to the code analysis with

404
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,959
tools they exclude necessity of

405
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,199
availability of manual analysis the work

406
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,519
of pen testers the work of analytics

407
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,120
because there are certain classes of

408
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,040
vulnerabilities which unfortunately or

409
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,800
fortunately i don't know how to say it

410
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,199
but in addition well they cannot be

411
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,000
discovered otherwise but manual yes work

412
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,680
in this direction

413
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,600
however

414
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,240
we have more questions than answers and

415
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,920
by the way the question about

416
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,440
vulnerabilities

417
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,560
with the help of tools

418
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,199
and with the help of manual analysis

419
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,880
is it possible to guarantee that all

420
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,240
possible vulnerabilities will be

421
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,000
discovered that the code at the output

422
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,560
will be 100

423
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,000
well there's a paradigm that

424
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,440
well we can reduce the probability

425
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,480
of a certain share of percentage uh

426
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,199
spending a lot of resources on this

427
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,399
however we still cannot exclude some

428
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,279
zero days which we could not discover

429
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,720
previously on some other factors so

430
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,880
i would never sign a paper when somebody

431
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,560
would tell me that the guarantee that

432
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,399
the code is 100 safe i would never sign

433
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,839
the paper like that

434
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,480
well speaking about the code analyzer

435
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,000
the code is going to be better because

436
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,839
it's going to be safer but not 100

437
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,119
better okay let's do it in the following

438
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,919
way how can we measure this result for

439
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,160
the same development

440
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,360
uh that's a good question

441
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,599
as for ourselves we have adopted the

442
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,439
following concept we have internal theme

443
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,280
of security provisioning

444
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,480
and periodically we hire different

445
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,480
people from industry who make

446
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,959
independent assessment for us

447
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,319
what do you mean independent assessment

448
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,919
independent assessment from the point of

449
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,360
view assessment

450
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,440
we are like a dependent assessment

451
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,520
because you know we have the

452
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,559
uh

453
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,200
eye but we have our own approach

454
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,000
but it will have guys from the outside

455
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,400
uh like positive technologies company

456
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,880
the company which has

457
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,120
have great expertise they can come to us

458
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,679
they look at it because any work like

459
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,840
pen testing work security protection

460
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,440
analysis operations they can have

461
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,520
analysis results

462
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,440
there can be a team spend three months

463
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,160
and say we found nothing zero report

464
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,600
it's not really nice as a result

465
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,720
and anybody any researcher wants to find

466
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,039
some bugs or something to show something

467
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,840
as a result and it's also gonna be a

468
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,360
result and it's going to be a result

469
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,520
which shows that internal team worked

470
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,320
well so we from our side we would like

471
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,919
to compare our efficiency by this

472
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,440
indicator and the most interesting thing

473
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,919
is that if they bring us not an empty

474
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,600
report but with certain vulnerabilities

475
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,919
it doesn't mean that they didn't work

476
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,280
very good because there are some

477
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,799
situations when all the vulnerabilities

478
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,640
that were delivered to us we know about

479
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,039
all of them and they don't have such a

480
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,880
level of criticality in order to fix

481
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,240
them immediately right now that's why we

482
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,679
can evaluate them in such a way

483
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:46,960
maybe

484
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,679
there is a research about you know

485
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,000
some convincing formal methods that can

486
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,760
be managed but honestly speaking i don't

487
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,520
really believe it but you know coming

488
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,720
back to the topic of like scanias well

489
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,240
to my point of view

490
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,160
it's a very dangerous trend that is

491
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,320
available it says like we are going to

492
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,000
put a scanner to ourselves and we will

493
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,480
automatically reports will send to the

494
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,320
developers and they will fix everything

495
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,080
so when we don't have intermediary

496
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,160
person who will take care of this

497
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,360
scanner

498
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,520
so we need a certain documentator yes

499
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,280
definitely definitely you have to

500
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,640
complete it for yourself you have to

501
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,160
complete rules you have to add some

502
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,559
exceptions definitely because uh

503
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,480
out of the box

504
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,559
it doesn't work very well because every

505
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,320
team has their own approach they have

506
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,760
their own stack of technologies their

507
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,480
own peculiarities and basically gate

508
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,880
flow is separate and nobody knows what

509
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,720
should be scanned

510
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,360
that's why from this point of view this

511
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,280
is a dangerous story for example when we

512
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,559
have installed everything it's safe

513
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,480
because we have scanner it has scanned

514
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,160
everything but what's next first of all

515
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,840
these reports have to be cleaned by

516
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,760
somebody and somebody on the basis of

517
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,440
these reports should come to conclusions

518
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,120
and then these bugs should be fixed by

519
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,640
somebody

520
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,840
so

521
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,240
so that they wouldn't allow them for

522
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,159
repetition

523
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,960
so the more mature safety processes are

524
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,880
in the company inside of the product

525
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,280
security the less

526
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,400
automation means are discovering

527
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
bugs so developers at certain one of the

528
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,919
time they understand how in language

529
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,520
constructs they should allow the

530
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,159
problems and all the problems are moving

531
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,440
into some logical levels into problems

532
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,240
related with access right so those

533
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,679
things which scanner is not able to fix

534
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:30,880
from the principle interview because

535
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,559
scanner cannot understand the logic of

536
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,760
application operation and

537
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,720
this is where in the upstack they start

538
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,320
getting involved in more interesting

539
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,679
things and not just looking for

540
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,200
additional bugs okay i would like to

541
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,679
speak about results

542
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:46,840
as a

543
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,840
manager of development or maybe

544
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,280
technical director of the company or

545
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,559
maybe the ceo of the company how can one

546
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,120
measure the efficiency

547
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,400
of existing process of safe development

548
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,080
well the thing is that in order to

549
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,000
measure the efficiency of implementation

550
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,520
you didn't have it and now you have it

551
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,120
we have to understand how it was before

552
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,480
the implementation the point of

553
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,080
accounting how it can be compared

554
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,840
because they have not implemented any

555
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,679
process and even the assessment was not

556
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,280
the right one because assessment is the

557
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,520
part of the process so in here it makes

558
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,880
sense

559
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,840
to evaluate the dynamics uh dividing

560
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,679
them by iterations uh intermediate uh

561
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,240
periods and find uh concepts like the

562
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,400
quantity of discovered vulnerabilities

563
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,799
over time of life of zero day in their

564
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,679
products how fast patches are being made

565
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,760
risk wise uh you have to rank the

566
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,120
vulnerabilities and look at the

567
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,039
vulnerabilities do you have more of them

568
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,320
but right now there are low risk

569
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,320
vulnerabilities because

570
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,000
they are efficiently being cut by these

571
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,559
processes if i would build this then i

572
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,320
would look at the dynamics and i would

573
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,080
look at how effective the access

574
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,080
is growing but from which they started

575
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,480
growing

576
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,000
can you add something alexi

577
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,120
well i would extend this topic i will

578
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,640
make an example we had a very

579
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,840
interesting case with one of the

580
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,200
clients and we've been cooperating with

581
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,039
him in the course of several years and

582
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,440
they've started with coming to us with

583
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,720
the words okay look at this what about

584
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,880
the security of our present systems that

585
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,200
they've ordered from our services for

586
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,600
penetration tests after this they have

587
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,080
understood that we have to fight with

588
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,360
these situations and they were not

589
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,159
really happy about the results

590
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,760
not results of the test not the quality

591
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,520
of this test but results from the point

592
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,559
of view of availability of

593
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,720
vulnerabilities and from time to time

594
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,679
they started requesting services for

595
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,320
code analysis with instrumental means

596
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,960
the time was passing they started

597
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,760
understanding that certain expertise has

598
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,679
been developed they've purchased the

599
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,240
analyzer moreover they've built it in

600
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,559
into their assembly conveyor and right

601
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,480
now they are on the stage when

602
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,760
automatically they have a code analysis

603
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,679
when the information about vulnerability

604
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,440
arrives starting from the moment when

605
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,600
they are appearing in the code but they

606
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,120
don't allow them to appear in the

607
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,799
production so this is the moment when we

608
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,039
see the dynamics the dynamics of how

609
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,559
everything was started and level of

610
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,600
results and pen tests and right now how

611
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,799
it looks like

612
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,039
live but in order to evaluate the

613
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,960
current situation of course

614
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,960
we should attract external companies

615
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,600
which are going to conduct objective

616
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,039
assessment of the current condition of

617
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,320
the situation from the point of view of

618
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,039
vulnerabilities thank you very much

619
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,559
save development is a very important

620
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,679
development without which it's

621
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,080
impossible to go because

622
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,039
right now companies start developing

623
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,360
more and more of their own software

624
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,559
and vulnerabilities in this software

625
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,200
are not allowable because

626
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,559
they come to the result of the

627
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,840
development and they make it

628
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,679
unnecessary

629
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,840
and maybe even dangerous for the company

630
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,440
we can use a safe development like

631
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,799
motivation of the teams uh

632
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:14,720
implementation of themes for devstack

633
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,679
ops in the development team and there's

634
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,600
a lot of tools for safe development

635
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,960
and you

636
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,159
looks

637
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,320
like estate development is needed thank

638
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,039
you very much guys for interesting topic
