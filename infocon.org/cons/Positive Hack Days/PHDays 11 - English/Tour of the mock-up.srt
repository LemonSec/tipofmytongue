stand-up which is happening in moscow in

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,040
the course of many years

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,799
and today

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,000
because we are saying to you

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,560
hi right now but the fight is happening

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,199
in the course of 24 hours and right now

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,080
behind my back you see our great

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,880
standoff

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,280
you see all the risks which might happen

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,440
are being realized in it and there's a

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,719
lot of new things out there and what new

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,520
you will find here we will ask vladimir

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,480
who

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,039
i have been surrounded by vladimir today

19
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,520
and he knows everything about

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,879
this

21
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,000
city copy well i came to vladimir but

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
vladimir is not here well while vladimir

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,559
is not here i'm standing here waiting

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,440
for vladimir putin

25
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,359
well um i'm going to speak with you what

26
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,920
is behind my back this year our standoff

27
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,040
looks like real state

28
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,439
we became a state last year

29
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,920
we had one industry but this year we

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,080
have how many industries do we have this

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,479
year this year we have three industries

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,000
okay just a second i'm going to tell you

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,840
who is vladimir nazar

34
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,439
vladimir

35
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,159
from year to year he does those things

36
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,400
that you are observing today everything

37
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,479
which is happening on this standoff how

38
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,200
it looks like how it works what it uses

39
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,360
for its operation outside and inside up

40
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,920
down everything is made by vladimir

41
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,799
let's give him our applause

42
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,600
vladimir can you tell me please about

43
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,920
innovations what new things do we have

44
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,000
here because i see there's not a lot of

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,880
new industries here yes hello once again

46
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,360
i wasn't alone who was doing this i was

47
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,640
doing it together with my team

48
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,159
surrounding it

49
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,159
and they helped us to demonstrate it

50
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,520
well out of new things well this dummy

51
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,440
has not changed a lot but you see this

52
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,360
new cell in here

53
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,360
but actually we have three new cells the

54
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,400
first one is the oil production

55
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,440
this one that you see in the red color

56
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,840
this second cell

57
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,800
after the oil is being produced is being

58
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,040
transported

59
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,599
and the main transportation this is the

60
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,760
oil pumping station

61
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,319
it's here so the oil pumping station is

62
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,200
located here

63
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,120
and through the pipeline transportation

64
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,000
the oil is being delivered

65
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,480
all over this dummy city

66
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,239
the oil that is being manufactured here

67
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,560
and produced here also oil is being

68
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,319
transported

69
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,560
with the help of

70
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,319
railroad transportation

71
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,959
this is the

72
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:02,959
railroad filling station where the oil

73
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,720
products are being filled into the

74
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,879
railroad tanks

75
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,040
so we can put water intakes and when

76
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,040
hackers will make an attack the water

77
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,760
will spill all over the tanks

78
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,720
and another

79
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,239
thing see the tank is opened and the

80
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,640
pipe gets inside and it shows how the

81
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,360
real oil is going into the real tank and

82
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,400
we have scada real scad which is used in

83
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,720
real uh fuel distribution station

84
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,040
so if you look at this from this side

85
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,200
well at the bottom you see the rail

86
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,959
tanks are approaching

87
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,000
this distribution station and then it's

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,239
standing under the pipes and the oil is

89
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,519
being filled in those tanks

90
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,959
next one

91
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,280
in this cell in addition to all

92
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,400
transportation the oil is being

93
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,480
transported from thanks to enough to

94
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,959
other tanks so we have a tank

95
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,799
park tank fleet

96
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,280
we've made a beautiful tank filled with

97
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,200
windows so outside you can see

98
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,680
and what happens there if anything will

99
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,080
happen to it

100
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,399
the flow has been initiated and we can

101
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,479
give hackers the possibility to switch

102
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,240
on uh pumping and the uh oil pumping

103
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,280
station is being initiated

104
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,680
the only thing that previously we had

105
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,880
only the

106
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,880
floor of the old but right now we also

107
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,000
added like into the real tank parks

108
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,040
the fire extinguishing system these two

109
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,320
red tanks with foam and with water it's

110
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,040
been mixed up and delivered so inside of

111
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,919
the tank there is a red ring with tubes

112
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,320
so this red ring inside of the tank it's

113
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,199
a foam generator and as soon as fire

114
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,199
extinguishing system has been initiated

115
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,560
during the launch we're going to show

116
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,120
you how it works

117
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,720
it has a beautiful special effect

118
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,759
well the next presentation is going to

119
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,840
be at 220.

120
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,320
we are going to make fun together with

121
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,560
you with all these technologies

122
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,560
yes we are going to do everything for

123
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,520
the viewers and they will be able to see

124
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,000
how it works because we are not going

125
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,479
online at this moment so when the oil is

126
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,199
being stored then it's been transported

127
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,720
then it's going to be delivered to the

128
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,320
oil uh refinery and this oil refinery

129
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,280
this particular cell

130
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,960
these are the

131
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,759
you see the royal police location which

132
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,080
measures the speed and also shows the

133
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,240
video so the

134
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,560
refinery

135
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,199
which has this

136
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,759
electrical equipment then uh chimney

137
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,440
where the oil has been heated and then

138
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,520
rectifiers

139
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,400
electrical generator heater and

140
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,000
rectification

141
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,960
columns when the oil is being refined

142
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,720
then it's gonna be transferred well you

143
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,120
see the pipes well blue and now they're

144
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,880
yellow so this is

145
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,280
yellow and green aviation fuel

146
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,120
which is being delivered through the

147
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,479
pipelines directly to our airport

148
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,240
and this is a story with a colonial

149
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,960
pipeline into industrial risk when

150
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,560
everything is going to be violated the

151
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,919
airport will state without fuel

152
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,919
and then fuel stations we also have a

153
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,600
fueling station

154
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,759
when the oil products are being sold so

155
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,039
this new story about oil

156
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,960
do i understand you properly so that

157
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,120
this oil related story it's not a

158
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,160
separate segment but one two three

159
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,479
segments united together

160
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,479
and they are interconnected with other

161
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,479
elements of our

162
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,280
replica infrastructure

163
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,199
what other

164
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,960
inter-industrial

165
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,199
connections do we have do we have a lot

166
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,720
of them

167
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,520
yes

168
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,560
story number one is that this pipeline

169
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,960
which delivers oil products that's

170
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,680
number one we have the uh fueling

171
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,639
station the airport suffers from the

172
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,120
lack of delivery finished oil products

173
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,039
also are delivered to the railroad

174
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,520
transportation so the shutdown of the

175
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,560
railroad also can influence

176
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,360
negatively

177
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,199
to the transportation of oil to other

178
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,879
places what else can we say about the

179
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,400
oil

180
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,360
well

181
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,120
i forgot to tell you about the pipelines

182
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,720
everybody knows that in russia with a

183
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,560
lot of pipelines

184
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,080
and which accidents might happen with

185
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,039
the pipeline this oil pumping station

186
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,800
has a risk that if

187
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,759
the pressure wave will not be equalized

188
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,840
then there's going to be hydraulic

189
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,800
impact and this pipeline which is 100

190
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,520
miles length it will

191
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,879
explode and the oil will be spilled

192
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,599
in nature

193
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,160
usually the explosion happens on the

194
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,479
flanges this is the weakest point and as

195
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,319
we can see it from the life and this is

196
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,440
something that we've been looking in

197
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,599
news these things are happening once in

198
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,479
a while and it leads to the oil spillage

199
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,839
in lakes or rivers

200
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,360
or to other places where the water is

201
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,399
being collected for cities and we have

202
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,560
changed the water collection station so

203
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,200
it's a question to the environmentalists

204
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,959
they're watching our broadcast and

205
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,719
they're asking themselves the question

206
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,600
why the is sector

207
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,680
is directly connected to the

208
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,760
kindergarten

209
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,680
it's not directly connected well there

210
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,120
is a rescue station in the middle

211
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,680
fire rescue squad

212
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,600
so it's all separated in our replica

213
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,440
well this is a small replica it's all

214
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,000
schematic okay let's go back to the

215
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,320
inter-industrial ray scan to whatever is

216
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,640
happening so when the pipe is exploding

217
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,399
well during the lunch we're going to

218
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,240
show you and we'll show the imitation

219
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,080
how the oil has been spilled and there's

220
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,560
going to be a spill down here yes down

221
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,360
here it's going to be a big brown spill

222
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,040
when the oil is going to leak from the

223
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,480
pipe and during the lunch time you're

224
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,440
going to be able to see it online

225
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,040
well i'm telling you

226
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,040
this cell

227
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,200
standing out but these two other ones

228
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,720
these two new cells so your lake has

229
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,200
moved from the old lake and this is a

230
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,360
new cell

231
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,279
replica so let's go back to the

232
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,279
industrial one okay let's move to

233
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,519
another one so in another cell we have

234
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,160
changed the next to the steel uh

235
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,920
refinery

236
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,920
steel mill well this is a water

237
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,160
processing plant the water is being

238
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,040
taken from the river it's been pumped

239
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,600
rectified cleaned and been delivered to

240
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,839
the city and this is a drinkable pot

241
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,440
water

242
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,640
no no

243
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,120
policies

244
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,320
you are going to stick your finger in a

245
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,519
water cleaning station the water comes

246
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,640
from another place then it goes into the

247
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,200
grain then it go goes to the collector

248
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,200
to the initial grinders cleaners

249
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,640
rectifies aeration and uv cleaning then

250
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,680
pure water goes back to the

251
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,519
water collection point

252
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,760
yeah in this in this particular point

253
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,680
water is pretty

254
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,399
dirty then we have a controller

255
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,279
we did have scatter controller

256
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,320
for water purification it has been

257
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,720
improved okay

258
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,959
let's go to the steel mill

259
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,040
last year we were not able

260
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,160
to complete these two shops if you

261
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,800
remember we had two shops

262
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,560
still mill shops but these buildings

263
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,640
were closed right now we have opened up

264
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,680
and we have produced two separate

265
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,480
factories this one is a continuous

266
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,600
mailing and you have those slabs

267
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,360
rolling around here and according to the

268
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,279
technology uh domain furnace

269
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,200
transfers into the steel steel has been

270
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,480
delivered here and through the

271
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,240
continuous

272
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,560
the milling it's been rolled continuous

273
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,640
rolling

274
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,000
yeah and this is the rolling mill

275
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,160
you see the rollers are rotating here

276
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,640
with a different speed and the tube is

277
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,000
thicker in the beginning and then

278
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,600
thinner thinner thinner and in the end

279
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,079
after rolling tube goes to the finished

280
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,199
product warehouse
