1
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,960
[Music]

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,920
which potentially could work in research

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,119
companies

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,199
well people say that there is a cyber

5
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,920
security which is a separate industry

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,920
which is not really interesting because

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,320
nobody knows what they do there so let

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,320
me go and develop something more

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,479
fashionable more publications or clouds

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,760
and right now we're going to speak

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,360
together with managing director of

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,760
positive technologies who is responsible

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,640
for

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,840
development alexey monreva alexey

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,280
hello so from the very beginning if you

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,000
will look at both of us uh generally i

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,399
can tell you that we have not agreed

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,320
about colors uh

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,879
only the shoes are different but pens

20
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,559
are similar but we

21
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,879
do see our reflections when we look at

22
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,079
each other yeah synchronicity

23
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,519
you are responsible for a big segment of

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,200
developing and positive how many people

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,560
work for you 350 people 350. okay

26
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,680
is it interesting to be a developer this

27
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,520
is the first part of the question and is

28
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,080
there any difference between a developer

29
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,840
for the cyber security and the developer

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,439
somewhere else

31
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,920
well it's very cool to be a developer in

32
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,479
cyber security you started with a joker

33
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,400
yeah the main question

34
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,799
let's see

35
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,799
my point of view this is one of the most

36
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,400
interesting

37
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,200
jobs today because developer first of

38
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,680
all it's an engineer person who creates

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,799
something new and cyber security is an

40
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,399
area

41
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,040
which from one side is an integral part

42
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,840
of it industry and on the other side

43
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,880
it's a very narrow specialized area

44
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,079
and those solutions that we create are

45
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,719
having the aim to discover the criminals

46
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,719
and stop the criminals

47
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,560
of course

48
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,800
from one side it's a classical

49
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,120
engineering work to create software

50
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,680
products which are very highly

51
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,360
technological they work with high loads

52
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,280
they are very complicated

53
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,120
architecturally

54
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,319
and from the point of view of the

55
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,760
architecture of the application but on

56
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,520
the other side

57
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,120
they contain the expertise developed by

58
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,720
our experts

59
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,760
and all this content and all this

60
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,040
knowledge that our expert team owns all

61
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,160
these can be applied and used

62
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,599
so we can replace an expert on the side

63
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,160
of the client

64
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,040
through this software and this is

65
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,920
something very complicated um

66
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,200
in answering your question

67
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,000
product development in the area of cyber

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,400
security it's always a challenge

69
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,200
it's

70
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,400
always a challenge when you understand

71
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,720
that

72
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,959
red team attackers

73
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,400
and of course everything depends in

74
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,640
which conditions your product operates

75
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,800
and you have to discover those attackers

76
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,200
you have to create conditions

77
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,239
when

78
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,640
your product will be able to discover

79
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,280
and uh

80
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,519
respond to attackers

81
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,440
you came from another industry when you

82
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,599
came to positive you have not been

83
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,680
working in cyber security industry

84
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,159
previously

85
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,519
what have changed in your perception of

86
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,760
development when you came to us tell me

87
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,120
on your example well it was an

88
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,400
interesting path

89
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,000
as most of us

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,159
in the department of development

91
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,680
and research

92
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,879
our path

93
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,959
was not related to the information

94
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,560
security and

95
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,920
in general my personal path

96
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,360
started from a company

97
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,799
which everybody knows

98
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,000
since the beginning i've been working in

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,120
acronis and i worked there for 10 years

100
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,279
and we've been creating high-tech

101
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,560
products

102
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,839
like that

103
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,800
this company was growing

104
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,759
we had a lot of global level

105
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,280
ips

106
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,160
which were admitted by best analytical

107
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,080
magazines

108
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,520
and us top high tech solutions from the

109
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,120
point of view of backup and restore

110
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,880
backup and restoration of data

111
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,040
so

112
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,639
this story

113
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,240
was more about it market and had no

114
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,639
relation to information security but

115
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,479
then it did happen

116
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,040
that when i moved to yandex searching

117
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,000
for more interesting projects for myself

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,720
i've been noticed by

119
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,840
writers

120
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,639
raiders of recruiting people people

121
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,039
who've been searching for proper

122
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,479
developers

123
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,720
especially for positive technologies and

124
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,600
from one side it did seem to me that

125
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,160
this area is like what is informational

126
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,880
security very strange solution

127
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,039
well looks like some anti-viruses

128
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,800
because i've been doing such interesting

129
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,479
products

130
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,960
where you had to work with file systems

131
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,440
with big data with clouds and then some

132
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,680
antiviruses it's like well it's not for

133
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,759
me i've said but when i've learned more

134
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,479
about it i decided to see what kind of a

135
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,160
company is it and when i've learned

136
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,240
about people inside of this company when

137
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,880
i've learned

138
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,560
about the product

139
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,680
i've got

140
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,560
poisoned by this beauty and this story

141
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,720
became very interesting to me

142
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,360
i found a place for myself and i found

143
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,479
new challenges i found new results so i

144
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,199
had to join and last seven years

145
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,720
i feel myself deeply involved but what

146
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,919
was that main trigger

147
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,440
thanks to which

148
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,479
you switched from another interesting

149
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,080
area because yandex is also an

150
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,440
interesting company with a lot of

151
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,160
software products when you moved in

152
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,800
unknown cyber security

153
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,080
sector

154
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,440
what was so interesting there

155
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,080
component of engineers operation is to

156
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,120
understand your own purpose what you are

157
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,400
doing when you create a car or a rocket

158
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,639
or maybe when you create some i.t

159
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,280
solution which works with big data for

160
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,039
example you always have a challenge

161
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,479
challenge that you feel a challenge that

162
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,240
makes you wake up every morning and make

163
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,759
next steps so i found such a challenge

164
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,840
in building informational security

165
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,400
solutions

166
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,639
what is informational security in the

167
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,880
enterprise level

168
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,160
especially speaking about big

169
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,199
enterprises our clients are big and very

170
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,120
big enterprises

171
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,360
and it's always

172
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,639
really high level of requirements

173
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,520
to the network components for example

174
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,400
let's look at traffic analysis what is

175
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,039
traffic analysis in

176
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,520
core enterprise network

177
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,560
there are dozens and hundreds of objects

178
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,919
it's a very complicated set of protocols

179
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,080
and big set of protocols to which

180
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,199
services communicate with each other

181
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,840
it also involves a wide landscape of

182
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,360
threats for which we have big number of

183
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,199
solutions in enterprise and when you

184
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,319
create a solution which addresses for

185
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,280
example network monitoring you have all

186
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,440
this i.t landscape

187
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,680
standing in front of your eyes

188
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,240
you have to develop

189
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,360
such

190
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,240
network traffic and connection sessions

191
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,799
uh technology which would allow us

192
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,240
to do it lastly work with traffic also

193
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,640
you have to develop the expertise of

194
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,599
network high load you have to develop

195
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,320
network expertise generally

196
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,120
because those days have passed when the

197
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,120
network when the chain was looked at us

198
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,839
something that has to be looked uh

199
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,880
urls or ip

200
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,800
but the network monitoring is too far

201
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,880
away right now we're looking deeply in

202
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,000
the protocol who anticipates in these

203
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,560
discussions uh which data

204
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,160
replacing

205
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,880
which tactics and techniques are used by

206
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,160
attackers

207
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,600
against certain solutions which positive

208
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,160
develops in order to develop their

209
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,399
attacks and for us to find

210
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,920
the solution so you dive into all this

211
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,600
information and diving into this

212
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,200
information you can invent how the

213
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,279
application should work in order to be

214
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,160
able to see these attackers the actions

215
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,680
of

216
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,080
and certain stages of investigation

217
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,720
setting promotion okay let's speak about

218
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,279
this part on one side i do understand

219
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,240
that you should have while working cyber

220
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,720
security you should have a wide

221
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,959
breadth of networking knowledge

222
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,560
knowledge about networks

223
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,120
infrastructure

224
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,720
in order to understand how the products

225
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,880
can be developed and this is the hacking

226
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,000
part

227
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,800
how do you build your relations with a

228
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,839
team

229
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,519
how do they provide you with this

230
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,880
information about hacker actions and how

231
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,079
it does

232
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,120
this change in how do you change your

233
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,959
products well it's an interesting

234
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:21,920
question

235
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,480
our path and search for those formats

236
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,880
within which we can create products

237
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,800
which from one side could be

238
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,480
really

239
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,880
expand from the other side would be

240
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,800
expert oriented

241
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,480
this is a story which honestly speaking

242
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,040
well i can write a book about it

243
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,760
how did we move into this format that

244
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,680
has been implemented by us

245
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,760
but we did discover this vein this form

246
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,680
of relations

247
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,319
expertise

248
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,399
as

249
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,959
people who far away from development

250
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,959
they always look at development

251
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,320
department

252
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,480
well we gave you an objective and you

253
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,800
have to solve it within a product

254
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,880
of course we have to do just that

255
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,920
and

256
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,839
an executive

257
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,959
format is like when they get

258
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,880
development for the developers sometimes

259
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,120
it doesn't work because only in a

260
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,240
dialogue

261
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,959
and this experience have shown us and

262
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,680
in a dialogue between expert objective

263
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,839
which is given by the expert and the

264
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,440
expert which

265
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,680
understand

266
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,680
how would they see the architectural

267
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,320
solution how they look at

268
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,519
uh realization of those goals

269
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,200
it wouldn't be possible without any

270
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,880
dialogue and only with the availability

271
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,800
of this constant dialogue you can

272
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,160
achieve something

273
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,839
what about the dialogue

274
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,120
you have some new guys who have seen

275
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,880
attacks in areas like standoff for

276
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,959
example now

277
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,959
and they're telling you well we've been

278
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,040
attacked this way this way this went

279
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,000
this way and you come to the conclusion

280
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,399
of what is to be done with the products

281
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,079
yes we do have certain practical

282
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,479
approach

283
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,000
developing solutions especially if we

284
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,600
speak about the

285
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,040
analysis

286
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,399
traffic

287
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,279
how the dialogue happens right now one

288
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,839
side we have a goal we come to the idea

289
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,480
that from deep monitoring analysis and

290
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,040
indexing of the traffic our solutions

291
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,399
are not full and it's irrespective do we

292
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,880
have it or maybe these are amanda

293
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,200
technologies but back then we did have c

294
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,560
um

295
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,360
on the other side we do understand that

296
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,120
expertise

297
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,560
in traffic processing is something

298
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,560
that needs a future development of the

299
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,959
company how it happens often

300
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,279
you take some open source for example

301
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,200
north or surrey cut projects and then

302
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,240
you use it you take signatures they have

303
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,320
mechanisms and it looks like it's

304
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,240
already a solution

305
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,680
but when you start thinking

306
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,760
which particular objective you're

307
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,399
solving you come to an idea that oh my

308
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,760
god

309
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,000
open source

310
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,079
yeah you can take it but you cannot make

311
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,920
an enterprise solution that will work

312
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,000
for tens of gigabits you cannot do that

313
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
without your own school without deep

314
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,440
level of modifications and you have to

315
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,000
begin everything from the scratch

316
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,480
without any practical expertise in the

317
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,279
area of network forensics network

318
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,399
security

319
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,240
you will not be able to take and create

320
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,880
a product which could see

321
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,600
the

322
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,800
activities of attackers in the network

323
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,040
so we start collecting a team um

324
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,839
and the story with a nod

325
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,040
product that we working which discovers

326
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,360
attacks in traffic

327
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,079
it

328
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,920
has started since 2014 2015. can you

329
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,839
imagine how many years have passed

330
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,920
we have created this school since i was

331
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,120
like 16.

332
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,560
in expertise and in development and

333
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,480
they've been working with each other

334
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,279
developers

335
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,639
they've been discovering the best

336
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,959
information well i will stop you just

337
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,399
for a minute

338
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,839
because we do have actual attacks as you

339
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,720
understand it's a live show and we did

340
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,079
have a certain

341
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,440
fraud in ticket sales system

342
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,720
i see information on the screen

343
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,040
and video is going to show

344
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,080
us what has happened

345
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:15,050
[Music]

346
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,720

[Music]

349
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,160
we did have an attack against

350
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,079
transportation system in a result of

351
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,399
which we could have events which you

352
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,480
just seen on your screen

353
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,680
and this is uh impact of trains hackers

354
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,560
have gained access to

355
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,440
electric train rails uh shipped and the

356
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,040
trains went off track

357
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,440
we don't want to think what can happen

358
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,120
in reality but let's go back to

359
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,600
interview josh i have a question about

360
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,880
the development trends

361
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,720
in can you name what is interesting

362
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,399
where the cyber security development

363
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,920
moves into which direction

364
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,839
it's an interesting question that we'd

365
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,720
like to speak about

366
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,720
objectively things that we observe in

367
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,880
recent 10 years

368
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,990
[Music]

369
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,399
it's a unification of products which

370
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,000
information security vendors

371
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,599
are putting into a single ecosystem or a

372
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,679
platform or a framework there are

373
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,240
different names

374
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,199
and they do have a goal of creating of a

375
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,959
single console

376
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,839
which controls all the subsystems and

377
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,679
products from which

378
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,280
the watchtop the solution has been

379
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,000
assembled so that we could solve

380
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,160
all the problems from one place

381
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,240
and this is a very understandable trend

382
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,880
most of biggest western vendors are

383
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,799
moving in these directions some came to

384
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,360
this earlier some just are coming to

385
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,360
this

386
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,840
and behind all of this irrespective that

387
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,520
this trend we do see a lot of hype

388
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,320
around it around this topic

389
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,480
if just for a second you will forget

390
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,080
about a t

391
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,960
you can forget about the i.t security

392
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,679
which is directly related to the ite and

393
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,559
does addresses problems which are

394
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,240
happening in the framework of

395
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,400
exploitation of these needs from the

396
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,760
point of view of cyber security

397
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,840
so if you'll forget about all this story

398
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,000
you will understand

399
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,600
which objective

400
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,400
does the cyber security as an industry

401
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,840
has

402
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,639
cyber security

403
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,280
it's not an objective to build

404
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,880
ecosystems so they don't have an

405
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,559
objective of building

406
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,679
creating hype around a recent trend that

407
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:34,880
we've seen

408
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,320
um

409
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,679
user these were solutions

410
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,840
like behavioral analysis solutions

411
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,400
profiling

412
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,039
of user behavior

413
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,799
in the network there was a lot of hype

414
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,840
around this topic yes learning so

415
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,080
machine learning is developing and why

416
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,240
don't we encapsulate this data from

417
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,280
information security under the wing of

418
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,000
those solutions which use the machine

419
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,840
learning algorithms then we can build

420
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,840
models and we start catching deviations

421
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,679
initially it sounds right and

422
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,760
interesting but there is a lot of hype

423
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,120
and there is a lot of practical

424
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,760
application in all of it so honestly

425
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,520
speaking

426
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,080
i'm not against machine learning i will

427
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,960
tell you this definitely i really like

428
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,640
it and data science and

429
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,880
data science school application it's a

430
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,200
good space for application of your

431
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,720
efforts uh from the point of view of

432
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,840
machine learning

433
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,880
however the main goal is the same

434
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,520
informational security creating

435
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,919
technologies solutions methodologies

436
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,000
conditions where attackers cannot

437
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,320
execute the initial penetration into the

438
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,440
network or realize some

439
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,000
activities which from the business point

440
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,400
of view

441
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,880
are not acceptable that's the main

442
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,799
objective and we shouldn't forget about

443
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,200
that because behind all this

444
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,039
technological hype

445
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,760
and behind all these technological ideas

446
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,720
which are being supported by marketing

447
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,120
pr departments

448
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,040
and they create solutions for those hype

449
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,360
[Music]

450
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,960
challenges

451
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,799
sometimes we forget about this main

452
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,840
story why do we create all of these

453
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,919
in order to reduce the gap between the

454
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,799
attacker and defender

455
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,120
and when we do have those solutions

456
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,760
technologies and practices which help us

457
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,360
in the conditions

458
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,320
of

459
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,360
high

460
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,440
employment deficit in the area of

461
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,120
expertise in informational security from

462
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,200
the point of view of those people who

463
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,400
use the

464
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,159
information security solutions and we

465
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:53,760
need to give an opportunity to the whole

466
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,440
world to all companies globally

467
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,280
create conditions

468
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,240
when attackers will not be able to

469
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,240
achieve their goals this is our main

470
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,400
objective and sometimes people forget

471
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,760
about it when they uh

472
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,240
attacking other ideas which are being

473
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,039
promoted by the marketing machine

474
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,280
and finally i would like to tell you

475
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,080
that

476
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,480
this inadmissible and impossible sounds

477
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,840
from everybody sits in my studio so i

478
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,600
think this is really understandable

479
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,520
thing as a goal

480
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,600
because it determines

481
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,480
measured results

482
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,039
inadmissible should not be possible and

483
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,000
yet in the end of our broadcasting okay

484
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,840
but take your hands

485
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,559
what alexis

486
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,039
alexi is a person

487
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,640
who uses his own hands to

488
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,720
develop products

489
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,120
which are being sold with the amounts of

490
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,960
billions of rubles

491
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,600
i think

492
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,600
this is a great achievement of creating

493
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,600
this software with his hands and with

494
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,880
his head

495
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,440
and this software is being practically

496
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,559
applied on a global scale

497
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,520
and it can be expressed in such big

498
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,600
money which clients are ready to pay for

499
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,840
these solutions so can you finally tell

500
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,440
us several reasons why talented

501
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,000
developers

502
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,640
who possibly have not even been thinking

503
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,200
about moving to cyber security world why

504
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,000
should they think about it twice why

505
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
should they think about becoming a cyber

506
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,159
security developer well thank you very

507
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,880
much for such nice words

508
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,000
second of all

509
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,840
what would i say to developers

510
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,280
just couple weeks ago

511
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,280
i'll make a retrospective into a

512
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,880
previous event

513
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,520
let's do it we decided to

514
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,480
have an open doors day

515
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,679
we've

516
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,679
opened the pub we have organized some

517
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,320
beer some food and we have invited

518
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,679
developers just to communicate with us

519
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,840
not our recruiters we didn't have any hr

520
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,080
people just developers who helped to

521
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,159
organize it and we wanted to give them

522
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,240
opportunity to touch us

523
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,679
and remove this veil of

524
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,280
untouchability

525
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,039
we are those people who make these

526
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,799
products and we came there

527
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,120
the head of the development department

528
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,799
for different products we've been

529
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,799
communicating we've told them what are

530
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,520
our products what do we create we didn't

531
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,120
want to sell us we

532
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,760
didn't wall we didn't want to kick the

533
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,880
job off or we just wanted people

534
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,640
to have an opportunity to learn about us

535
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,320
and if people wanted to learn about

536
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,480
positive technologies and why there is

537
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,240
so much hype around us what's so

538
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,840
interesting about us and honestly

539
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,760
speaking this format was really viable

540
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,760
it's really interesting format because

541
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,039
we've been able to communicate about

542
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,640
different topics from hardware to

543
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,440
software from front-end to back-end

544
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,240
high-load machine architecture machine

545
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,520
learning

546
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,840
and of course

547
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,919
we do see a certain conversion and we

548
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,840
have agreed about a certain joint work

549
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,840
so what would i say to developers

550
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,600
especially those who are interested in

551
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,840
cyber security or maybe those who think

552
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,000
that this is something shadowy well

553
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,400
cyber security like any other industry

554
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,720
is highly demanding

555
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,880
industry to the engineering school it's

556
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,520
highly demanding to high loads data

557
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,919
science to building complicated

558
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,240
architectures

559
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,559
it's sensitive to application of

560
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,440
development practices and other hype

561
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,600
things and private clouds and

562
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,039
blockchains

563
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,240
all these is expressed in cyber security

564
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,240
solutions that's why what would i say

565
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,600
please come to us talk to us

566
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,840
we will definitely repeat this open door

567
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,559
uh

568
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,080
where we are going to show you openly in

569
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,360
a direct touch we're going to speak

570
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,039
about our technologies about ourselves

571
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,039
how do we create it and whose hands are

572
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,799
creating it thank you very much lesha

573
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,159
for this interview it was really

574
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,320
interesting and to my point of view it

575
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,159
was really inspiring especially to those

576
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,919
people who are interested in development

577
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,200
and those who search for new

578
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,360
possibilities for development first of

579
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,039
all for their own desires and their own

580
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,520
talents like i actually have told us in

581
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,320
development you need to know

582
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,520
a lot of

583
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,480
uh adjacent things which are going to

584
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,840
help you to develop not a separate

585
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,640
technology inside of a separate product

586
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,400
but you will work for the result which

587
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,400
can be expressed that

588
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,840
inadmissible events for companies and

589
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,159
even states will become impossible

590
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,799
events
