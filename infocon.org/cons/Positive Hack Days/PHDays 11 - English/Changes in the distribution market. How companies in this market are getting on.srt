1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,200
security market

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,519
consists of the vendors

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,000
like positive technologies then we have

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,880
distributors after distributors we have

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,440
partners and after partners we have and

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,039
client

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,680
that receives products and services

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,039
and this

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,840
dual level model

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,599
is a typical it market model on the

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,119
global arena

12
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,680
and right now i'm going to talk to

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,800
representatives of distributors

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,399
and we're going to speak about how the

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,960
distribution market works today and how

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,520
was it influenced by those events which

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,760
happened to all of us i'm visited by

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,160
dmitry kareninka the head of the

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,320
information security department uh from

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,160
forties distributor

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,680
and there's the chilean server

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,760
director from network and

23
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,000
telecommunications marvel distribution

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,879
hello hello

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,680
we did have a lot of changes in the

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,400
market especially recently

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,560
can you share your experience how do you

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,000
feel yourselves in your realities

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,759
are there any big changes that you see

30
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,400
due to current situation and are

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,759
distributors

32
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,530
influenced by the situation

33
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:28,880
[Music]

34
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,240
of course

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,360
we can say that situation has changed

36
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,520
for everybody

37
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,520
it has changed for the country in

38
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,600
general and distributors were the first

39
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,560
ones to face financial logistical

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,560
difficulties and

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,320
felt these first impact of sanction

42
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,720
story

43
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,720
in addition to that

44
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,280
distributors

45
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,119
were in shadow

46
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,079
previously but we are the foundation of

47
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,880
the atm market

48
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,680
we sell today security market and we are

49
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,160
a basic element of the availability on

50
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,160
distribution of technologies

51
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,680
so in principle it market was formed

52
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,599
well 70 percent it was formed by the

53
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,840
import of technologies to distributors

54
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,280
so everything which is related to

55
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,400
imports

56
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,480
right now due to well-known reasons we

57
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,160
do have certain difficulties related

58
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,800
with imports so after taking this first

59
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,440
impact against ourselves we did find a

60
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,760
way on how can we cope with this problem

61
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,640
and perhaps end clients and partners

62
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,640
they feel that but speaking about

63
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,560
specific changes number one

64
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,160
that most of the vendors have formulated

65
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,040
their position especially western

66
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,560
vendors and i'm speaking about western

67
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,440
story foreign companies

68
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,360
they have formulated their position some

69
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,599
of them stay some of them stay in new

70
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,400
conditions some of them leave the market

71
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,599
or maybe

72
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,599
halted their activities those who stayed

73
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,200
in the market they've introduced new

74
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,319
rules

75
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,280
prepayment the absence of

76
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,239
delays and story number two is expert

77
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,080
control this is a very interesting

78
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,280
factor

79
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,760
because

80
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,040
we

81
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,920
see

82
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,360
limitations every day and it influences

83
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,879
the periods of

84
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,040
uh supplies because we have to look at a

85
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,599
lot of different sanctions

86
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,319
and these changes are happening every

87
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,360
day and this influences the speed of

88
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,400
realization of the order previously

89
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,120
if we speak about software programs it

90
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,439
may reach a month or even more

91
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,959
so this is a common trend and if you

92
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,879
will bring it to the result it's a

93
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,560
prepayment story

94
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,360
increase of the deadlines for the order

95
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,120
execution and factor number three

96
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,280
reorientation

97
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,400
to domestic software products hardware

98
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,720
products networking equipment well we're

99
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,120
going to speak about it in more detail

100
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,079
marvel how does marvel fail in a current

101
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,519
moment of time

102
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,080
well it's not the first year that brings

103
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,759
challenges to us if you will remember

104
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,960
2020 where had pandemics we felt that

105
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,479
everything's bad

106
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,320
but we've survived we were able to

107
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,960
withstand we have increased the growth

108
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,240
rates

109
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,560
we've grown faster than it was planned

110
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,759
then it was the year 2021 when we did

111
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,000
have problems with the component

112
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,360
supplies

113
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,240
deficiency of uh

114
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,720
microchips in the market delivery

115
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,560
deadlines were moving from seven eight

116
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,479
months to seven eight seven eight weeks

117
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,000
to seven eight months we thought it

118
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,960
cannot be worse

119
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,639
but optimist said that it could be worse

120
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,759
in the beginning of 21 nothing

121
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,440
and right now february has happened and

122
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,199
we are thinking well let's go back to

123
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,880
2020

124
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,320
when everything was understandable

125
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,320
and like dmitry said distributors

126
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,520
felt it

127
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,280
they were the first one to feel this

128
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,880
impact

129
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,199
we've built our partnership work that

130
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,039
they trust us and they trust

131
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,800
they expect certain actions from us and

132
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,080
right now partners are on the market

133
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,000
they are on this market and they are

134
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,960
telling us can you offer something to us

135
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,720
tell us what can be offered what can be

136
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,400
delivered and we are going to do that

137
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,000
and our main objective right now in

138
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,919
shortest period of time we need to

139
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,120
rebuild all our internal processes we

140
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,280
have to rebuild our delivery channels we

141
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,759
have to reorient

142
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,960
ourselves to other markets especially

143
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,840
russian market and we need to offer

144
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,800
solutions

145
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,160
which can be delivered

146
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,080
and most importantly solutions for which

147
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,199
we can be responsible these can be good

148
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,800
quality solutions

149
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,400
well right now we have an objective

150
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,639
to rebuild everything

151
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,039
as fast as possible and basically

152
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,120
speaking distributors and why do i speak

153
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,240
about market foundation because only

154
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,280
distributor can guarantee

155
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,080
some supply

156
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,960
logistical services uh reliability

157
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,639
because everybody got used to that well

158
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,199
the partners received the delay it's

159
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,960
been broadcasted to the clients and this

160
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,039
situation if you want to bring it into a

161
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,800
normal line you should find not only

162
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,520
domestic manufacturers but you need to

163
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,199
find some

164
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,800
supplies from friendly countries like

165
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,039
china new production like india maybe

166
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,199
brazil

167
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,840
and they do have certain information

168
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,080
security solutions maybe some unique

169
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,560
niche solutions

170
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,039
so i would precisely say that you

171
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,280
shouldn't forget about imports

172
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,520
completely

173
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,280
you shouldn't discount it

174
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,680
we need to support new uh

175
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,000
developers which come to russian market

176
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,479
well according to your estimates

177
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,120
which volume of your business

178
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,120
approximately

179
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,560
affects this current situation

180
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,759
well let's see

181
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,280
i would answer this question in the

182
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,520
following way

183
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,960
it depends on the following factors

184
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,960
speaking about distributors what was the

185
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,720
product portfolio

186
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,759
what was its orientation

187
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,599
and how after year 2014

188
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,240
was this portfolio diversified by the

189
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,560
distributor by some local solutions what

190
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,319
is the geography of the presence and

191
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,800
product portfolio how well is it

192
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,039
balanced

193
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,879
well does it depend on the distributor's

194
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,879
profile yes it depends on every uh

195
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,479
distributor for example if distributor

196
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,639
was a software oriented yes if hardware

197
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,479
and services that's totally different

198
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,800
informational security or

199
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,360
graphics or any other solutions we need

200
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,120
to look at this specialization if you

201
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,120
look at the i.t security

202
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,919
then our portfolio was selected on the

203
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,680
basis of uh

204
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,199
well american technologies are the

205
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,080
second term the first term is uh

206
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,000
domestic and israeli solutions because

207
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,559
israel is very neutral country

208
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,559
and many have stayed with us and

209
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,080
continue working with us

210
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,679
that's why

211
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,760
we have survived it

212
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,040
and in those places where we have lost

213
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,480
we have

214
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,480
gained in domestic solutions and this is

215
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,440
the current situation

216
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,200
well from my side i can say that sales

217
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,480
plans uh speaking about the year 2020 21

218
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,120
22 nobody has been reviewing our sales

219
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,360
program we are not changing our sales

220
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,160
programs and from our side

221
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,640
colleagues are waiting but we are not

222
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,160
changing anything we have planned growth

223
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,640
we will provide this growth

224
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,880
which vendors that's a totally different

225
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,279
question this is our goal

226
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,080
well this is the most interesting part

227
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,240
let's speak about that

228
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,040
because this is wonderful that your

229
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,959
sales plans are not changing and it

230
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,360
tells us that

231
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,360
corporate

232
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,000
management asserts for possibilities of

233
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,760
fast adaptation

234
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,640
uh to a new market situation but how

235
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,120
how do you plan to

236
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,880
keep these numbers

237
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,160
well i'm going to tell you about

238
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,880
ourselves sir because uh we do not work

239
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,640
in the informational security market i

240
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,320
work in networking department which

241
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,360
includes

242
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,680
the information security as well

243
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,680
before 24th of february in my portfolio

244
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,320
in portfolio of my department i had 65

245
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,150
vendors

246
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,839
[Music]

247
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,880
as of 1st of april those who have

248
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,279
stopped their work and we understand

249
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,279
what does it mean they stop the work it

250
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,360
means that manufacturer is not going to

251
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,959
come back but will come back in totally

252
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,440
different conditions to the market so i

253
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,519
have 29 working vendors it was as of

254
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,160
april 1st less than half yeah less than

255
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,279
half state

256
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,079
more than half left the market by may

257
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,200
1st but peace in the country

258
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,959
i already have contracts signed or in

259
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,160
work on the level of 66 67 countries so

260
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,600
in the course of two months

261
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,839
we were able to sign contracts with

262
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,440
chinese indian south korean

263
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,000
manufacturers israeli manufacturers some

264
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,320
russian manufacturers in addition to

265
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,200
that we have our own brands in marvel

266
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,800
plus

267
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,480
this brand has increased its portfolio

268
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,160
so the process cannot be stopped

269
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,480
and we have approximately 20 contracts

270
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,000
upcoming

271
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
well from this point of view i would

272
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,680
like to show a

273
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,680
small optimism because one thing is to

274
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,440
sign a contract and the second one is to

275
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,920
build new financial logistical

276
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,160
paths

277
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,000
because we see a lot of manufacturers of

278
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
server equipment coming from china and

279
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,600
it's a problem number one for the atm

280
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,959
market

281
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,800
and for the security market because they

282
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,079
also depend on these

283
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,560
so in order to check

284
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,839
that we will be able to deliver

285
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,519
these products for the needs of the

286
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,639
market

287
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,880
the server equipment because we do have

288
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,760
new contracts

289
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,639
we have to check this equipment

290
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,600
and it will take at least six

291
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,120
months

292
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,360
in order to say that vendor keeps to its

293
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,000
promises

294
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,959
our equipment is being delivered through

295
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,800
these contracts the only thing the

296
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,399
services not my department is a

297
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,160
neighboring department and i know that

298
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,440
there are certain difficulties with

299
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,519
servers as for our service we

300
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,959
manufacture our own servers

301
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,920
but you still assemble them yes we

302
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,519
assemble them

303
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,639
not on american cpus we can assemble

304
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,920
them with the use of chinese cpus second

305
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,959
of all we can assemble them on cpus

306
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,839
which are delivered to russia by

307
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,240
parallel import

308
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,160
parallel imports is a very thin matter

309
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,399
and as for processed cpus

310
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,200
but the world is interdependent well

311
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,519
definitely and we cannot avoid that

312
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,200
and we have to learn how to work with

313
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,600
this okay let's speak about uh hardware

314
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,720
and parallel world

315
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,440
do you see any areas in a hardware

316
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,959
supply

317
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,440
which cannot be

318
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,800
closed by foreign players and there are

319
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,040
no alternatives with other ones servers

320
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,839
it's a problematic situation and also

321
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,480
notebooks

322
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,560
and which things can be closed

323
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,519
networking equipment is easily closed

324
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,880
like routers switches switchboards and

325
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,760
other things so this is easily

326
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,440
covered by us and when we started

327
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,079
communicating with chinese manufacturers

328
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,600
we have discovered

329
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,199
that most

330
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,839
of our traditional western vendors

331
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,480
are based on chinese vendors and they've

332
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,720
been selling them under their brand so

333
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,959
right now it happens

334
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,880
that originals will be delivered to

335
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,880
russia so western vendors they put in

336
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,680
their own hardware

337
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,560
no they order from chinese

338
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,880
manufacturers their own hardware which

339
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,440
has been manufactured with labels of

340
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,240
those companies which order

341
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,079
but you buy directly from them yes

342
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,279
in a car there's a possibility and i

343
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,440
come to them and say can you sell me air

344
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,760
filter and they say do you need original

345
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,800
from your brand or from the manufacturer

346
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,600
which makes this filter for your brand

347
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,880
and the difference can be two times

348
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,480
and this is the situation that we face

349
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,279
today uh ups

350
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,120
uninterrupted power sources they also

351
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,720
can easily be replaced and biggest

352
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,959
player on this market in russia have

353
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,040
stopped at the manufacturer they have

354
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,440
halted and some of them already selling

355
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,720
their factories when they started

356
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,120
searching for manufacturers in china

357
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,120
they found some of them and we've

358
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,760
discovered that once again many of those

359
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,959
manufacturers have been delivering the

360
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,399
batteries for well-known italian brands

361
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,040
well what about chinese

362
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,680
do they easily cooperate with us yes yes

363
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,560
they is the corporate for china

364
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,839
inside of china

365
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,440
there's an objective of taking russian

366
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,360
market as much as possible and biggest

367
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,240
chinese banks give discount loans for

368
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,000
the companies that open business in

369
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,680
russia

370
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,360
and would like to add to these that

371
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,079
there are different uh china

372
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,079
different chinese there's also taiwan

373
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,880
small technological island with which we

374
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,199
do have certain difficulties without any

375
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,800
doubts so generally speaking

376
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,120
it's going to influence the situation

377
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,480
and as we've been speaking about it

378
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,320
previously these server capacities are

379
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,720
limited and it will influence other

380
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,199
industries and we will try to solve this

381
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,120
problem

382
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,360
well speaking about parallel inputs

383
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,160
do you see this equipment

384
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,240
delivery model being well developed in

385
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,880
our country and do you think that it's

386
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,800
going to grow or maybe it's going to

387
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,199
reduce in the near future well right now

388
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,920
it's underdeveloped

389
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,839
you know that the law

390
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,120
draft was in the end of april and the

391
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,399
law was adopted may 6.

392
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,639
and

393
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,800
and as traditional distributor we've

394
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,800
been delivering only that equipment that

395
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,000
was permitted on our territory and with

396
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,839
the permission of those vendors which

397
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,319
are present here so from this point of

398
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,639
view

399
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,919
this great market state in the beginning

400
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,439
of 2000s

401
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,720
right now market was really civilized

402
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,720
so we're going to go back to the

403
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,959
beginning of 2000s and we're going to

404
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,679
build this as well

405
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,000
well for russia for russian legislation

406
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,919
it's not going to be a great market for

407
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,520
russia it's not gonna be a great market

408
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,440
because we are following russian

409
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,360
legislation so it's gonna be

410
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,080
well this equipment will be

411
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,679
on the territory of the weather but for

412
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,679
the russian legislation we do not

413
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,440
violate russian legislation we import it

414
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,000
officially we pay all the taxes so from

415
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,840
this point of view

416
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,280
there is not going to be

417
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,760
green peace

418
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:04,480
unfortunately for those who wanted to

419
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,320
get cheaper equipment well it's not

420
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,000
going to happen

421
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,440
well i would like to end here that

422
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,520
parallel import especially in the

423
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,200
conditions of physical supply of the

424
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,120
product but if distributor is involved

425
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,200
in high-tech products it's not enough

426
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,000
just to deliver the server

427
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,679
and hardware software complex and there

428
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,360
is a software part which can also be

429
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,440
limited in the work especially remote

430
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,039
work so there could be different

431
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,440
limitations so parallel import is not of

432
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,320
salvation

433
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,919
so the measures which have to be

434
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,880
approached carefully

435
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,799
because intellectual rights and

436
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,960
reliability of transferring these

437
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,039
intellectual rights have been building

438
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,640
the russian market for quite a while

439
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,080
right now we have civilized approach

440
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,559
from this point of view so we don't

441
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,840
need to destroy

442
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,240
it well it should be solved by some

443
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,320
other people but would like to go back

444
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,799
to domestic manufacturers especially in

445
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,520
the area of security

446
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,840
things that we see

447
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,320
big impulse given to the distributor in

448
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,000
the market it's reorientation to

449
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,080
domestic one the laws

450
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,320
so in addition to some negative factors

451
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,200
or not completely understandable once uh

452
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,080
how imports there are positive factors

453
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,679
that many clients

454
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,520
they have to buy domestic

455
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,880
and of course as for the domestic

456
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,280
manufacturers they have to communicate

457
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,200
closer with distributors because success

458
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,000
is not only any administrative well you

459
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,760
have to buy this and you go and buy

460
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,720
these

461
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,360
but and clients they are used to a

462
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,360
certain quality of the products partners

463
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,640
they are used to conditions

464
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,960
in partnership program and success in

465
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,400
combination with administrative

466
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,880
regulation but also with a number of

467
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,799
other factors good quality products good

468
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,360
quality partnership programs

469
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,640
availability of technical support

470
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,400
because distributor is not just about

471
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,240
logistics but it's also about providing

472
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,360
additional services like demo warehouse

473
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,720
marketing

474
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,720
wide proliferation of technologies in

475
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,120
the channel not only the largest ones

476
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,520
but also the medium level lower level

477
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,039
lower tier

478
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,960
clients according to your assessment

479
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,559
russian products and services are they

480
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,679
sufficient

481
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,520
or maybe we have some niches which are

482
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,159
not covered by them and we need western

483
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,720
vendors well i think that in the world

484
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,240
there are three schools of information

485
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,000
such as american soviet and russian

486
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,080
there are certain peculiarities

487
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,400
everywhere speaking foreign

488
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,320
security is called many niches have been

489
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,760
closed but if you look at the market

490
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,120
generally well speaking about the new

491
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,039
things which our company was involved

492
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,400
into we've been

493
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,760
delivering something that's going to be

494
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,679
popular in two three years what's going

495
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,840
to be developing for what we are going

496
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,679
to see demand

497
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,360
and from this point of view there are

498
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,240
certain gaps available which can easily

499
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,600
be replenished and this can be used by

500
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,880
developers they can look at different

501
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,880
systems

502
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,120
this is a well developing product so you

503
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,440
can catch up with them and be advanced

504
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,679
in this year but the main difficulty is

505
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,400
on the utm device market

506
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
because we have a limited number of

507
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,120
manufacturers of software and hardware

508
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,520
complexes plus software well this model

509
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,440
is a model that will develop in the

510
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,360
nearest future so speaking about cyber

511
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,679
security everything's okay without about

512
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,840
cyber security yes on the basic level

513
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,320
everything's all right but if you will

514
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,919
compared to some other things if you

515
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,679
will compared to general i.t market

516
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,080
like operation system or virtualization

517
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,600
networks

518
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,679
then of course there are certain over

519
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,520
bands well this over band is not so

520
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,799
strong

521
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,120
in some classes and subsystems uh some

522
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,720
things are not available but there is a

523
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,960
number of solutions which cover big

524
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,039
number like 70 percent of a total

525
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,200
security demand on the side of the end

526
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,440
clients

527
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,880
we have faced another peculiarity or

528
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,360
challenge

529
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,159
before february 24

530
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,240
we had only four manufacturers in our

531
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,840
portfolio of russian manufacturers have

532
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,200
been available

533
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,760
but only at the initial stage

534
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,280
of signing

535
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,559
and when we started re building the

536
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,000
portfolio in the direction of russian

537
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,760
manufacturers we have discovered an

538
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,080
interesting moment in order to replace

539
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,200
one foreign um

540
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,120
developer from the first three tiers of

541
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,600
informational security you need five or

542
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,480
six russian manufacturers

543
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,120
to cover the whole portfolio completely

544
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,520
the breadth of the portfolio is much

545
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,679
narrower

546
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,840
so maybe it's not a problem but a

547
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,159
challenge or a limitation inside of

548
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,159
russian manufacturers and from my point

549
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,520
of view

550
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,799
it's in the

551
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:27,520
interest to remove and add this

552
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,320
so these products are not bad every

553
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,640
russian manufacturer

554
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,200
has three four maybe five

555
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,799
products of

556
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,120
good products

557
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,720
products which are being delivered by

558
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,400
them to the market so if they will

559
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,080
increase this portfolio if they will

560
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,559
improve their other products

561
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,799
then it's gonna be much simpler and

562
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,000
better for them and consumers okay let's

563
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,480
draw a line

564
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,480
speaking about russian cyber security

565
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,559
everything's okay about it but what is

566
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,480
important uh it's important that vendors

567
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,840
should have at least four or five

568
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:09,760
products in order to cover all the areas

569
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,480
yes we have to develop the complex

570
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,360
approach to cyber security so the vendor

571
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,880
with the name of product

572
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,200
with number more than five projects in

573
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,039
their portfolio

574
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,440
good quality partnership program should

575
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,960
be available technical support

576
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,159
commercial conditions

577
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,039
then friendly markets from the point of

578
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,400
view of

579
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,320
product supplies and uh

580
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,799
hardware and software

581
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:45,360
what can we look at china india

582
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,880
china is for service and speaking about

583
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,960
service brazil india

584
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,240
israel

585
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,520
and israel

586
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,879
israel yes israel as well

587
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,640
and this problem with hardware supply is

588
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,600
related to only some hardware these are

589
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,640
laptops and servers

590
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,320
yeah this is a problematic part

591
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,200
but there are possibilities of

592
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,159
replacement by chinese manufacturers and

593
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,559
it's very fast well the agreements are

594
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,279
being signed with them like with marvel

595
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,039
and um

596
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,880
and the situation is much worse as i

597
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,360
understand you will say that sales plans

598
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,400
are

599
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,120
five times

600
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,400
we should keep kind of retained optimism

601
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,200
and

602
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,279
we have to search

603
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,360
for the whole market we need to find

604
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,479
solutions for the whole market

605
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,480
well thank you very much for interesting

606
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,240
conversation with speaking tonight

607
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,159
absolutely director of network and

608
00:25:58,159 --> 00:25:59,360
telecommunication and marvel

609
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,679
distribution and meteor cranium the head

610
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,720
of the informational security in 40s how

611
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,640
the distribution market works today in

612
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,480
our new realities and what are we going

613
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,760
to expect by the end of this year
