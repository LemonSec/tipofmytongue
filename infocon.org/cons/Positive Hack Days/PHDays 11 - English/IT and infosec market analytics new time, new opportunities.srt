00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,480
session here at positive hack days on

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,120
the i.t and infosec market analytics let

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,439
me welcome our guests we've got with us

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,279

alexander

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,800
t advisor analytical center

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,800
colleagues

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,200
security is something that is the focus

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,360
of our attention here from any

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,320
perspective uh things changed uh since

12
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,879
the end of february and i was

13
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,800
trying to analyze the market my stuff i

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,960
don't understand where to start

15
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,320
what should be the starting point

16
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,680
all our

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,920
traditional methods do not work

18
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,920
the reports or past reports on how the

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,600
company uh

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,080
or any company would be growing it

21
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,880
doesn't matter anymore

22
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,080
well thank you very much it's my first

23
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,680
time here thank you for inviting

24
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,920
everything's changed uh dramatically

25
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,920
and historic

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,520
data is no longer relevant

27
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,759
dynamics and external

28
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,439
restrictions create the situation of

29
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,360
complete uncertainty

30
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,000
in march

31
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,200
things were very quiet

32
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,200
people will be planning just for one day

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,759
and they will be analyzing uh in the

34
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,799
one-day dimension

35
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,040
we have a better reference plan and in

36
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,520
our racing agency we focus on the future

37
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,799
and the best

38
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,240
uh helpers uh to us in our work other

39
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,159
companies themselves

40
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,680
before february

41
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,239
take an outsider view of the companies

42
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,000
we could work with

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,680
public data

44
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,040
now to get

45
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,280
quick feedback from companies through

46
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,680
interviews or questionnaires is perhaps

47
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,640
the only way

48
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,840
over short periods of time

49
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,360
we are not

50
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,920
making any plans even for a year maybe a

51
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,239
quarter two quarters ahead this is our

52
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,640
current uh time frame

53
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,840
and uh and now i wanted to address and

54
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,599
use this opportunity to address the

55
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,680
companies and the industries not to

56
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,080
close off uh given the circumstances

57
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,239
there is huge trends you

58
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,360
cut off information uh supply well we

59
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,680
didn't have much information anyway well

60
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,160
yes but now we are having even less than

61
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,920
less than that people are

62
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,120
using the current situation not to

63
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,640
disclose anything about themselves but

64
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,720
think about your future shareholder

65
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,319
value and market capitalization

66
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,720
it's not going to disappear right so

67
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,879
let's share the information uh and use

68
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,920
it for anal analysis

69
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,840
okay which parameters can we analyze

70
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,080
today alexander

71
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,720
companies i mean how do you filter them

72
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,000
how do you sort them a company is

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,319
in operation today and it's gone

74
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,760
tomorrow today it's a

75
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,920
an immersion startup and

76
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,879
tomorrow it's gone because it cannot

77
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,920
pay off the credits

78
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,360
well um analytics or intelligence

79
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,560
consists of several segments right

80
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,599
there is

81
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,640
qualitative and quantitative analytics

82
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,879
there is analytics

83
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,560
for the purposes of forecasting and

84
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,080
there is analytics

85
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,799
of historical data

86
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,159
in the

87
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,239
times in the last two years

88
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,360
it became much more difficult to do

89
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,519
qualitative analysis not all companies

90
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,439
are happy to disclose their numbers and

91
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,799
they are

92
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,480
no longer willing to share their

93
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,399
forecasts already in 2020 2021 it became

94
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,238
difficult to get the forecast out of the

95
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,360
companies caveat changed the market uh

96
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,759
substantially and it was hard to predict

97
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,840
what would happen tomorrow now it's next

98
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,400
impossible

99
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,000
the special operation killed off

100
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,600
analytics right

101
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,639
well yeah kind of not all of it though

102
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,800
of course you can't do much with

103
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,280
qualitative analytics

104
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,759
but uh or rather quantitative analytics

105
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,120
but there is qualitative analytics and

106
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,600
your understanding of trends

107
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,720
and the understanding of the demand

108
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,720
when talking to customers you can make

109
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,639
assumptions as to

110
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,240
which of their products will be in

111
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,560
demand

112
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,720
yes but

113
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,280
it's hard to get numbers today

114
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,120
like you were saying i agree

115
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,240
today probably we need to

116
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,120
focus on analyzing trends

117
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,280
and the impact of the macro environment

118
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,360
onto our market rather than what we did

119
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,880
before

120
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,840
when we would be drawing pie charts and

121
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,720
growth crafts here on here probably you

122
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,639
can do it today but it would be

123
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,120
meaningless

124
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,199
yes

125
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,759
i mean you see how fast

126
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,800
things are changing

127
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,160
working with customers and with their

128
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,080
information is

129
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,160
probably the only source

130
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,360
that we have

131
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,360
budgets are changing budgets are being

132
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,600
reviewed together with priorities and

133
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,639
financial capabilities the companies

134
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,560
respond to the current situation

135
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,880
differently someone some lost there are

136
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,880
some companies that actually won and

137
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,360
from uh what is being happening right

138
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,440
now so we'll

139
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,560
analyze that

140
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,720
and companies themselves like i said

141
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,440
they are a good source of information

142
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,880
especially the information can be

143
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,160
verified through third parties

144
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,560
to go back to pie charts and market

145
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,800
shares

146
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,639
now the number ones the number twos

147
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,280
exactly yes so now

148
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,639
currently

149
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,400
most of foreign vendors left the russian

150
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,840
market or they suspended their

151
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,160
operations or they are you know sitting

152
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,479
on the quiet and uh

153
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,479
it would be impossible to get any

154
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,080
numbers or any other information from

155
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,199
them

156
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,639
but

157
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,720
in the information security markets i

158
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,720
mean we have

159
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,039
hundreds of players and we have dozens

160
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,319
of segments and these segments are not

161
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,840
disappearing

162
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,759
so we will continue analyzing russian

163
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,840
players and those companies who decided

164
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,759
to stay and for them the numbers will

165
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,440
not be predictive rather they will be

166
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,880
analyzing the uh past periods data uh

167
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,680
especially if you have data a year by

168
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,840
year the annual reports

169
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,759
but does it make sense to to do this

170
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,000
kind of analysis like like you were

171
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,520
saying

172
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,440
today the

173
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,319
only

174
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,199
the only uh thing worth analyzing is

175
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,599
qualitative information but okay in a

176
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,120
particular segment you have one two

177
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,759
three russian vendors but

178
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,720
not more than that i mean we all know in

179
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,160
every segment who is number one who's

180
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,720
number two and actually even those

181
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,599
numbers are not important they do not

182
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,440
matter there is a leader there is the

183
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,919
follower but does it make sense to to

184
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,479
report market shares or anything you're

185
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,840
a gift

186
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,759
well actually yes i think it makes sense

187
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,919
and we are not it's not about the whole

188
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,680
market of information security as such

189
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,160
but we need to identify the segments

190
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,479
that the customers want to see products

191
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,919
in and in those segments

192
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,800
there will be top fives top sevens top

193
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,560
tens it's not like we have a couple of

194
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,479
companies only in each of these segments

195
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,400
is not for the vendor only a rating

196
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,919
exists also in the interest of the

197
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,199
customer

198
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,360
the customers use ratings to uh

199
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,560
to organize attendees to enter into

200
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,320
negotiations with different vendors

201
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,640
speaking about uh various pie charts and

202
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,640
everything the market size but you have

203
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,519
to also remember about the general

204
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,599
financial situation of these companies

205
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,920
what their financial standing is to go

206
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,600
back to the

207
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,600
meaning of business they want to attract

208
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,760
investment they want to

209
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,360
be financially sound information

security has always been a closed market

211

but they need in resources even in this

212
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,320
market it's pretty high and in order to

213
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,880
get this need

214
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,959
addressed the outsiders need to

215
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,200
understand what these companies

216
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,399
look like

217
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,959
how they feel themselves

218
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,760
i talked to many vendors

219
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,680
and they were saying

220
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,600
it's important for us we need to see the

221
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,839
numbers to talk to financial

222
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,440
institutions we need to

223
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,600
present ourselves to them exactly a jp

its dynamics its financial standing its

226
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,040
indebtedness its uh revenue dynamics so

227
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,760
i agree we need numbers we still need

228
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,240
numbers we need time series

229
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,160
so that

230
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,560
when the years go by we would be able to

231
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,800
see how the company survived this period

232
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,880
uh what was happening to them in the

233
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,839
difficult times

234
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,640
a quick comment the investors who

235
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,240
wanted

236
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,640
to find startups

237
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,720
with international ambitions many of the

238
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,600
investors are now switching to

239
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,160
domestic players

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,880
they

241
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,839
understand all about improv substitution

242
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,600
it's gone beyond government sec the

243
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,959
government sector

244
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,800
it affects now not only government owned

245
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,399
companies but also the commercial sector

246
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,079
so the potential there is very high

247
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,360
investors are

248
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,880
looking at the sector and they need the

249
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,440
numbers to be guided by and then there

250
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,720
are regulators surface beef stack

251
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,800
the ministry of industry the ministry of

252
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
telecom they also need numbers

253
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,060
why do they need numbers

these companies also

274
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,920
suspended their work here because i mean

275
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,880
many again were guided by the

276
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,959
opinion of these companies because they

277
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,360
are big brands they are well known when

278
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,600
we did analytics ourselves and our

279
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,720
analytics

280
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,440
was not treated the same as the analysis

performed by international companies

282
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,480
doesn't give us a chance as analysts

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,600
to

284
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,839
for our voice to be heard better all

285
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,680
this niche will be left unoccupied

286
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,519
well is this a good thing or a bad thing

287
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,120
i think it's a bad thing

288
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,079
still

289
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,440
because competition is always good and

290
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,040
it promotes products it promotes

291
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,160
industries

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,600
you have to

293
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,399
uh think better than your neighbor you

294
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,839
win in this competition so it's bad

295
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,240
it's bad whether it's a chance or it's

296
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,800
not a chance for russian analysts well

297
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,760
yes of course it's a chance but it's a

298
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,240
chance that will not be

299
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,800
becoming true without any

300
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,240
feedback from the customer companies

301
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,079
of course we do not have as much

302
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,360
reputation as international uh

303
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,720
colleagues had

304
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,720
and it will take time for us to build up

305
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,480
this reputation but we have several

306
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,560
years to do it

307
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,040
i agree it's not like it's a chance but

308
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,120
it's it's an obvious

309
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,760
thing i mean it's uh apparent that you

310
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,720
need to move into the niche now that

311
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,560
it's vacated and we did it and we will

312
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,920
continue building up our uh capacity but

313
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,200
if you review key reports of itc on

314
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,800
the main industries that they made

315
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,480
public

316
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,959
they are mostly analyzing foreign

317
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,279
vendors foreign vendors are no longer

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,639
with us

319
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,160
so

320
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,279
the methods that the idc used

321
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,839
they used questionnaires they used

322
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,200
interviews

323
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,440
they

324
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,200
you know they've been using these

325
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,120
practices for years

326
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,000
and even if i idc stayed

327
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,639
they wouldn't have much to analyze left

328
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,560
analytical technology right another

329
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,000
important aspect is analysis of

330
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,720
technology and analysis of products

it closely we do not have our own vision

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,120
here on the other hand

339
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,519
well i think that we need to build up

340
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,399
our own expertise we need to

341

educate people who will have experience

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,120
and understand the technology and

who will have hands-on experience and

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,920
what they need

348
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,279
to to

349
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,120
to grow up so to say they need a

350
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,040
comfortable environment they need a

351
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,800
support environment a supportive

352
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,440
environment and investment it can be

353
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,040
cheap

354
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,800
this expertise doesn't come cheap

355
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,199
very well then i would like now to turn

356
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,160
to

357
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,199
analytics monetization we know that a

358
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,240
gardener report is expensive and they're

359
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,199
monetizing their expertise through the

360
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,959
sale of their data here

361
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,560
everyone

362
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,079
is used to public information

363
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,720
information that costs nothing

364
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,480
information for free

365
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,079
do you think they will be able to have a

366
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,160
switch to the western model

367
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,639
well we also have closed reports

368
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,959
uh probably we haven't been using this

369
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,760
model as actually as the open model but

370
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,279
we do have

371
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,430
reports for sale

372
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,640
[Music]

373
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,839
in

374
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,120
analytics they performed qualitative

375
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,399
analysis and i think that's something

376
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,800
that we need to uh

377
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,360
we need to go deeper into work with

378
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,160
vendors work with customers

379
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,279
create better reports

380
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:54,120
the model is quite workable i think

381
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,079
to the interested parties and here we

382
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,440
must go back

383
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,320
to

384
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,639
the idea of communication with the

385
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,880
companies it may sound like a for-profit

386
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,639
story but in fact there are many

387
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,320
interested parties there from the

388
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,120
government all the way to corporates

389
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,160
yes customers should also make their

390
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,399
suggestions on which analytics they need

391
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,160
and they should be open to analytical

392
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,839
companies by providing information uh by

393
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,160
alerting themselves to be interviewed or

394
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,560
questioned

395
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,000
we have five minutes left

396
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,320
there is another

397
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,360
topic that i think we must discuss

398
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,320
many big customers

399
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,600
today are switching to russian analogs

400
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,480
they are substituting foreign products

401
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,880
with russian analogues

402
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,439
and they need to be sure that the vendor

403
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,359
that the manufacturer has a sound

404
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,160
financial situation and a vision because

405
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,839
it's a risk we are paying several

406
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,760
million dollars today and in a couple of

407
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,079
years the company will be

408
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,359
dismantled the founders

409
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,600
will leave the company

410
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,240
start a new business

411
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,840
well uh

412
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,520
there is one tool the credit ratings

413
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,520
that's what we do it's what we

414
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,679
specialize in we are assessing the

415
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:42,960
financial standard of the company's

416
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,640
regulated industry it's been around for

417
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,080
many years and unfortunately

418
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,760
not even information security but rather

419
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,799
the whole i.t sector just because uh

420
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,520
there we do not have many classical

421
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,039
listed companies public companies

422
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,840
because not many companies are listing

423
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,919
are trading their bonds

424
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,000
in fact it's quite an inexpensive

425
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,760
service that can answer many of the

426
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,840
questions that you've just raised and

427
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,280
russian international western nation

428
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,960
investors will all understand the credit

429
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,120
rating

430
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,360
apart from the regulated uh segment i

431
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,280
mean you need to look at the company

432
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,919
history uh the company track record and

433
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,160
its current projects as well

434
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,720
whether the potential bidder the

435
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,400
potential

436
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,240
provider has many customers on notes how

437
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,480
stable his orders are

438
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,400
i mean all these things are not

439
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,960
regulated

440
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,919
but

441
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,919
we collect this information into a

442
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,919
public knowledge database

443
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,360
basis

444
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,320
it's a

445
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,960
an efficient tool

446
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,440
competition is very positive the more

447
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,240
different opinions there are the better

448
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,039
it is for the company itself

449
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,000
one contractor i mean

450
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,400
you might suspect that there is vested

451
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,160
interest but you have to have

452
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,960
many sources of information

453
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,480
and another quick question about the

454
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,679
startups markets

455
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,080
[Music]

456
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,320
i think that

457
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,120
we can forget about startups in russia

458
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,440
for the near future i am of the opinion

459
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,679
that the market will consolidate all the

460
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,919
small teams will be immediately

461
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,320
brought up or picked up

462
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,320
by bigger companies kirill what do you

463
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,480
think

464
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,400
well the classical definition of

465
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,760
startups

466
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,559
like a company existing for

467
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,039
i don't know in the next year or 18

468
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,200
months there is no market of angel

469
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,480
capitalism anymore so yeah

470
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,080
no classical stops

471
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,919
here but maybe inside family offices of

472
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,280
big investors

473
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,480
we may be seeing some uh small teams

474
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,720
emerging it's not it's not a start-up as

475
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,600
such but it's a capital-backed um

476
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,440
development it's not going to be mass

477
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,280
market definitely

478
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,559
yes there is no

479
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,039
well there are fewer angel investments i

480
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,200
agree

481
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,400
but

482
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,799
you know that we we have ecosystems we

483
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,080
have spin-offs and inside and around the

484
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,480
ecosystems the

485
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,280
nurses can the niches can be taken by

486
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,400
small companies spinoffs from ecosystems

487
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,320
the companies that are set up with the

488
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,240
money of big investors big corporations

489
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,679
when companies work for big customers uh

490
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,600
the developers see a niche and the

491
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,320
customer would be willing to finance as

492
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,039
a

493
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,720
project like this

494
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,880
uh with different motivation schemes for

495
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,320
the employees

496
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,799
well yeah i i think that ecosystems

497
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,240
whether we're going to have three five

498
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,080
different ecosystems in a while i think

499
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,240
here the market will segment

500
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,799
itself

501
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,320
a number of ecosystems

502
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,799
affiliated with big government on

503
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,559
corporations

504
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,039
in many cases it is already the case

505
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,520
look at ross telecom we'll look at spare

506
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,200
bank or ross adam ross adam has lots of

507
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,559
different stuff

508
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,130
actually

509
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:24,229
[Music]

510
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,080
yeah the important thing is not to lose

511
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,080
that

512
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,679
because it was a positive

513
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,640
development of the last several years uh

514
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,320
it's important that we don't lose it and

515
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,240
we need government support for it okay

516
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,159
colleagues thank you very much

517
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,720
it's been a pleasure

518
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,039
