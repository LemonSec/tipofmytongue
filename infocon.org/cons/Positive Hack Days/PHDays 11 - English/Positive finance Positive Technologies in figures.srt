1
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,200
and i will ask questions today to the

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,559
cfo of positive technologies

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,199
i've been asking a person who is closer

4
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,080
to finances in your company

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,960
and uh i had a chance to speak

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,480
personally to you about financial

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,720
reporting about even some specific

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,800
numbers of the company well that's what

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,120
i'm going to speak about today well the

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,880
first question that i would like to ask

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,239
you you've provided reporting for the q1

12
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,840
of your company and there was a

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,640
statement interesting statement

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,200
that corporate profits

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,039
the sales of the company has grown have

16
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,200
been tripled at the same time the

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,039
revenue has grown by 50 1.4 billion

18
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,199
can you explain why such difference

19
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,399
between

20
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,879
revenue numbers and sales numbers

21
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,879
how did you come with such serious

22
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,479
deviation well it's an important

23
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:05,840
question

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,520
i think this is fundamental question in

25
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,880
order to understand how the positive

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,640
technologies business model works what

27
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,159
are sales sales are

28
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:15,680
transactions which were made with our

29
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,040
clients so these are contracts that have

30
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,840
been signed procurement of our products

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,920
and licenses

32
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,080
and certificates for providing of our

33
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,759
services because we provide

34
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,400
a big cycle of services extended

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,200
technical support for our products uh

36
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,560
services of monitoring pen testing and

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,400
the main particularity is that compared

38
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,880
to sales which are contracted at the

39
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,000
moment when our client buys the product

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,759
and signs agreement with us or with

41
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,720
distributor revenue is admitted within

42
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,240
period of time according to the

43
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,119
requirements of standards of uh

44
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,399
international consolidated reporting

45
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,880
so the admins of this revenue comes with

46
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,799
a certain delayed effect a little bit

47
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,600
later than sales are happening that's

48
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,520
why sales

49
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,840
is a certain criteria of the future

50
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,760
growth of our revenue the volume of

51
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,319
sales which happen in eq one will be

52
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,480
converted into the revenue within the

53
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,879
year 22 the q2 q3 depending from when

54
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,280
clients will implement and will start

55
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,160
using those licenses or alongside with

56
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,920
the provision of our services support

57
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,760
services or any other services that we

58
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,360
provide to the clients

59
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,440
so out of these two indicators investors

60
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,400
should look at the revenue and not sales

61
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,959
which is more representative indicator

62
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,440
for them i think sales are the more

63
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,200
important one for the investor because

64
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,360
if investor looks into the future and if

65
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,200
investors interested how the company is

66
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,959
going to grow how the market share is

67
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,360
going to develop for us how effective is

68
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,519
our sales force how do we work with the

69
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,239
client how do we attract new clients how

70
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,159
do we increase the volume of sales of

71
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,519
course the first and most important

72
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,760
indicator is the growth of sales

73
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,200
moreover

74
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,840
we always understand you remember our

75
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,200
reporting we have very strong

76
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,120
seasonality

77
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,360
basically in positive technology sales

78
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,840
historically the main effect comes to

79
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,200
the q4 within a year that's why such

80
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,959
high level of q1 on one side it's a very

81
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,680
positive consequence of the fact that

82
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,080
right now we are moving with a good rate

83
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,920
but at the same time it would be right

84
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,920
to look at the indicator that we are

85
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,280
going to provide upon the results of the

86
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,920
year 2022 because the main contracting

87
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,680
the main transactions and procurements

88
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,760
on the side of big clients with whom we

89
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,840
work they are happening in the end of

90
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,720
the year usually this is q4

91
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,640
and some of this revenue will be

92
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,680
transferred into the year 2023 but all

93
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,200
this revenue

94
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,200
is a direct

95
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,959
obligation it's not just a correction on

96
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,120
the level of financial reporting this is

97
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,360
something that will happen earlier or

98
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,920
later the moment of admission

99
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,640
will be a little bit different from the

100
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,280
moment of admission of sales such high

101
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,519
indicators of q1

102
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,959
sales-wise

103
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,519
can they tell us that

104
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,040
future quarters will also be very strong

105
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,600
and much stronger

106
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,320
than in year 2021

107
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,320
i'm not bold enough to make such

108
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,320
forecasts because historically we were

109
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,560
able to see in previous periods that

110
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,479
sales been behaving differently in the

111
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,680
course of the year for example if you

112
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,199
will remember 2020 the year pandemics

113
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,360
limitations covered limitations when

114
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,840
most of businesses have been compressing

115
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,680
their activities everybody have been

116
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,520
moving to remote operations and we've

117
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,080
started q1 without understanding what's

118
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,600
going to happen how the clients will

119
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,720
react how budgets will change how the

120
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,560
procurements are going to be built and

121
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,800
to our surprise in the q2 we have seen

122
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,639
the break of all the trends we have

123
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,880
shown and indicated very high growth for

124
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,800
ourselves historically then it was

125
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,280
equalized but upon the results of the

126
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,759
year we have supported these dynamics

127
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,600
and sales of the year 2020 were really

128
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,479
high most likely that right now we will

129
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,560
see something similar maybe some

130
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,440
reduction i mean not reduction of sales

131
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,479
but reduction of dynamics so we may be

132
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,560
not going to see triple growth in

133
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,880
quarter two three but on average upon

134
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,720
the results of the s one is 22 we

135
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,840
believe that not less than fifty percent

136
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,520
growth of sales will happen compared to

137
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,240
the previous year uh

138
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,039
company practice net debt of the company

139
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,560
came to almost zero

140
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,039
so the monetary position was on level of

141
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,600
one billion according to your reporting

142
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,520
so the net debt at the end of the year

143
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,440
2021 was 1 billion if i don't uh forget

144
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,400
anything

145
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,639
if you don't think about the rent

146
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,639
so the net debt is on level of zero how

147
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,360
did you increase your net monetary

148
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,039
position

149
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,840
that's another side of our seasonality

150
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,880
if in sales we are moving to the quarter

151
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,400
four q4 most of the sales are happening

152
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,720
with the payment delay from our clients

153
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,600
and level from 30 to 60 days so

154
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,240
conversion of sales into the monetary

155
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,919
flow and

156
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,000
collection of accounts receivable

157
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,360
happens in the q1 so the q1

158
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,639
is a peak

159
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,639
of account receivable collection upon

160
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,560
the results of our sales of the previous

161
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,479
year and as a rule q2 q3 for us

162
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,440
seasonally from the money point of view

163
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,240
is more uh

164
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,639
having has higher gap we have the

165
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,319
deficit of liquidity because our

166
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,520
operational costs are constant sales are

167
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,120
still on the low level but by q4 we are

168
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,240
coming back to the positive net flow

169
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,880
that's why our net debt at the end of

170
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,039
the year and q1 of the year is the has

171
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,599
the lowest value plus this year we have

172
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:06,800
accumulated

173
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,919
a much

174
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,919
higher liquidity

175
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,440
uh reserve

176
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,199
with the consideration of certain

177
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,039
uncertainty that we've seen in february

178
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,400
and march which has allowed us to reduce

179
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,359
our net debt

180
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,680
so informing the cash flow of the

181
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,720
company

182
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,520
we see certain seasonality q1 with

183
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,520
consideration

184
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,880
of the fact that most of the sales in

185
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,840
the q4 with the payment delay money flow

186
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,520
comes to the quarter one q1 and q2 q3 as

187
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,479
i understand previously they were with a

188
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,880
negative cash flow yes and this is

189
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,639
specific to us and this year it's most

190
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,919
probably that you will have the same

191
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,199
trend yes it will definitely be kept in

192
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,840
q2 and q3 we will have negative cash

193
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,840
flow and this is a planned normal

194
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,520
situation for us we are going to

195
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,800
increase debt burden will increase it by

196
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,160
certain dates uh by the end of the q2

197
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,680
end of q3 the ebd net debt it's going to

198
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,879
grow

199
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,639
and q2 q3

200
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,800
mbd will be lower

201
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,280
however upon the results of the q4 it's

202
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,239
going to be compensated

203
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,840
if i properly remember the company has

204
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,599
announced payment of dividends on the

205
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,000
level of 1 billion

206
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,039
so the net debt will return to the level

207
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,800
of the end of the year after the payment

208
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,720
of dividends and is if i remember

209
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,880
properly the company has borrowed 370

210
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,880
millions and uh

211
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,279
for the advancement of closing these

212
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,039
needs in

213
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,640
cash position

214
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,799
at the account of the fact that q2 q3

215
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,399
will be a week from the point of view of

216
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,800
cash flow yes you're absolutely right as

217
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,720
i've told you previously we cognitively

218
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,959
went in the direction so that in the q1

219
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,800
we would accumulate additional liquidity

220
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,720
for the company because there was

221
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,800
certain uncertainty

222
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,640
for the exchange rates everybody been

223
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,240
thinking that funding will be more

224
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,399
expensive and it did happen but in the

225
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,240
future alongside with the situation how

226
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,600
the situation is going to change right

227
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,880
now we do see exchange rate changes and

228
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,600
we are going to be involved in

229
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,519
re-crediting of our portfolio

230
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,760
so i think in the peak

231
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,120
in the course of this year upon the

232
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,959
results of the q3 our net debt and ratio

233
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,360
between a net debt to fbda is not going

234
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,800
to be a 1.5 ratio so to us we define

235
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,480
this comfortable range 1 1.5 within

236
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,200
which we are ready to increase our debt

237
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,399
burden

238
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,839
coming back to cash flow

239
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,920
maybe approximately you will be able to

240
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,959
remember what is the percentage

241
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,200
well q4 as i understand is also positive

242
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,560
from the point of view of cash flow yes

243
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,920
so q1 is even stronger than q4 yes of

244
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,330
course

245
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:54,720
[Music]

246
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,399
so is there any ratio between q4 and q1

247
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,680
two to one one to two or whatever

248
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,480
well approximately they're similar but

249
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,959
q1 is a little bit higher by about 20

250
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,120
percent because the cash flow of the q1

251
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,880
is above the cash flow of the q4 and

252
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,760
one two three uh some seasonal minus in

253
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,480
quarters two and three

254
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,650
[Music]

255
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,120
marketing expenses has grown by 90

256
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,600
percent 440 million rubles in the

257
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,959
quarterback

258
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,079
maybe you can tell us about

259
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,880
what are those expenses why do you have

260
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,680
them

261
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,920
why such a serious growth this is not

262
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,800
only for marketing expenses this is this

263
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,600
sales support sales by themselves uh

264
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,920
sales function of positive and this is

265
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,440
something that we're increasing very

266
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,120
significantly we are start we have

267
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,120
started increasing it from the last year

268
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,680
we have understood ambitions that we had

269
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,440
for this year

270
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,480
that we are planning actively and

271
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,680
significantly to grow in the future with

272
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,279
current clients

273
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,720
go to new clients go to new niches

274
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,920
increase of the head count in the sales

275
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,640
department sales support

276
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,480
so sales this is also marketing yeah

277
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,720
this is sales and marketing so this is

278
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,720
not only advertising procurement not

279
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,040
only this event that were present no

280
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,360
this event is a very important component

281
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,040
definitely but we've been conducting

282
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,680
this event last year if you remember

283
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,920
this year and uh

284
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,760
keeping with within the same budget but

285
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,519
within the previous year and due to the

286
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,680
situation that positive was uh getting

287
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,440
ready for public positioning we've

288
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,519
changed our pr strategy we started

289
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,240
speaking more about ourselves we started

290
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,079
developing the

291
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,360
ar

292
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,920
relations with investors

293
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,920
transformation of sales

294
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,760
because expenses for different

295
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,519
partnership events

296
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,000
and this is a very important hiring new

297
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,360
sales supporting sales so these are all

298
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,720
directions which are the main part of

299
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,760
the sales marketing expenses concept

300
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,079
that's why they are growing with such

301
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,720
fast rates well as analytic i always

302
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,560
extrapolate certain results for the

303
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,560
future in order to build the model of

304
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,600
future profits and calculate just price

305
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,279
of the company

306
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,320
so the expenses also have to be defined

307
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,160
in the model so i'm interested in

308
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,399
question during the q1 growth of the

309
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,320
marketing expenses

310
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,639
will it be the same in the future

311
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,120
quarters proportionally we should expect

312
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,040
that these expenses will be continuous

313
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,200
it's not like one-time growth of these

314
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,360
expenses but all the expenses are will

315
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,440
grow proportionally first of all we look

316
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,600
at the growth rate that we have defined

317
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,920
for ourselves for positive for our

318
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,320
financial model it was always important

319
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,399
that our profit should grow with higher

320
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,639
rates than our expenses and this is

321
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,079
something that allows us to be

322
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,040
operationally effective show high

323
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,639
results of profitability and mbd and net

324
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,800
profit and to us this is very important

325
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,920
because we want to keep this

326
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,399
so this growth rate that we will define

327
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,399
for ourselves from the point of view of

328
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,639
operational expenses business

329
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,720
development expenses marketing expenses

330
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,360
will define those opportunities

331
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,440
that we see on this market and those

332
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,120
that we would like to implement and this

333
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,200
year we have very high rate and we would

334
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,720
like to do a lot of things we would like

335
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,320
to grow significantly this year we speak

336
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,680
about our strategy of annual doubling of

337
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,959
our sales

338
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,680
doubling of our sales every two year and

339
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,040
this is something that we've been able

340
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,199
to show historically and the higher our

341
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,199
base the higher is our level the more

342
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,279
difficult it is to support this ambition

343
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,600
and this is impossible to do

344
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,000
keeping it on the level of expenses well

345
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,040
this is very logical

346
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,519
well i would like to say that this is

347
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,199
still possible

348
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,800
to increase the revenue with high growth

349
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,880
rates which leads to the extension of

350
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,399
profitability

351
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,440
and profits are growing as well well

352
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,399
i've paid attention

353
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,360
it is little bit not logical that

354
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,040
marketing expenses if the company grows

355
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,440
this is a logical thing but uh

356
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,880
r d expenses

357
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,800
they have been reduced by the q1 of

358
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,920
2021. why

359
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,399
and will you keep this trend in the

360
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,199
future or should we expect the growth of

361
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,120
rng expenses

362
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,839
in order to properly estimate rnd

363
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,560
expenses it's not enough just to look at

364
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,560
p l

365
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,839
because our r d expenses they consist of

366
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,160
two parts we have capital expenses or

367
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,440
investments cut into capex

368
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,360
things that we spend for creating our

369
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,079
products development of new technologies

370
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,839
not all these expenses are being

371
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,839
capitalized and i'm speaking about some

372
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,560
significant major releases of our

373
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,199
products those releases that we are

374
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,920
launching just recently in april we have

375
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,720
announced a new product xdr but we still

376
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,199
continue investing money in it and

377
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,880
development phase has not been completed

378
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,240
right now in positive portfolio we have

379
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,639
approximately 12 products they are in

380
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,600
different uh life cycle stages some of

381
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,199
them are in very active period of

382
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,760
development some of them are already in

383
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,360
support so as product support which is

384
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,320
not a significant

385
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,920
amendment to functionality or

386
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,759
development of new technologies this is

387
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,000
operation expenses and the growth rate

388
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,639
for them is much lower because

389
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,040
they do not require any significant

390
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,680
investments into it more organic growth

391
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,920
and capital expenses this is something

392
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,720
that we will invest every year

393
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,480
continuing growing in the future so i

394
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,000
believe that in the course of this year

395
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,320
approximately 30 35

396
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,600
will be our growth for capex and

397
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,440
development of our own products and this

398
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,660
is something that is our r d investment

399
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,759
[Music]

400
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,360
i was always interested in the question

401
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,279
how do you divide expenses for r d which

402
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,360
of them are related to

403
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,079
cost part and which are included into p

404
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,720
l and which of them are included into

405
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,759
investments and being depreciated in the

406
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,560
course of future years to come

407
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,720
so is this threshold

408
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,600
because it's very thin and you can move

409
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,440
those expenses from one article into

410
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,480
another

411
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,360
yes these uh threshold is very thin by

412
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,279
the standards of financial reporting

413
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,959
international i have

414
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,000
uh ifr and auditors are carefully

415
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,680
following them checking our financial

416
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,519
reporting that there are no deviations

417
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,320
there and the main approach is that

418
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,079
while the product is being developed

419
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,560
before it started its commercialization

420
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,279
before it has earned any serious

421
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,000
positions in the market before the first

422
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,720
test sales are happening of this product

423
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,720
and piloting together with the client

424
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,359
while we still believe that functionally

425
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,240
product has not reached its maturity and

426
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,240
this is the main criteria functional

427
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,160
maturity of the product this is all

428
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,240
development and capital investments at

429
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,799
the moment when the product developed

430
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,119
has been stopped when it covers all the

431
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,439
demands and needs of the client solves

432
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,520
all their problems in the area of

433
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,679
information security

434
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,000
since that moment most of the expenses

435
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,440
will be support so support expenses is

436
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,720
operational everything else is

437
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,080
investment into development

438
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,200
yeah during the previous presentation

439
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,200
i've heard about growth problems that

440
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,280
you need to have a lot of people

441
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,120
that you need to scale yourself they

442
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,160
have to be placed somewhere any question

443
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,600
that has been formulated by our

444
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,919
analytical person whether these problems

445
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:52,640
are

446
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,559
actual for you and will the company

447
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,679
build additional office or maybe you

448
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,760
have enough space in the office where

449
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,039
you are right now will you increase your

450
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,320
rental space will you increase your

451
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,480
rental costs as well

452
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,640
these are proper questions and they are

453
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,000
important questions because right now

454
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,360
we're growing very actively if last year

455
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,480
the head count growth was under level in

456
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,679
course of one year 150 people this year

457
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,120
we practically have opened 300 vacancies

458
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,960
and in the course of first four months

459
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,200
we've actively grown we've hired a lot

460
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,039
of new employees and i'm not going to

461
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,240
hide it

462
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,960
we do have a problem of lack of

463
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,720
facilities especially in moscow because

464
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,640
we have several offices we don't just

465
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,720
work in moscow we work in six regions of

466
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,120
russian federation from one side

467
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,160
transition to remote hybrid format of

468
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,480
operations helps us from this point of

469
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,080
view and in recent couple of years many

470
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,400
of our employees moved into this hybrid

471
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,400
mode of operation it helps us it helps

472
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
us to save on those workplaces and

473
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,000
rental costs

474
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,760
however

475
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,640
we are solving this question

476
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,320
for our future extension with necessary

477
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,960
facilities so it's most likely that

478
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,320
this or next year most likely next year

479
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,640
we are going to be involved in some

480
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,000
capital investments into the rent

481
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,240
reconstruction so it's going to be rent

482
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,919
and not a purchase of your own office we

483
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,919
look at different options

484
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,799
i cannot tell you exactly

485
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,400
okay you've told us that you have a lot

486
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,320
of vacancies in the company tell me

487
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,280
please it's very interesting

488
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,320
because after recent events and i've

489
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,760
been speaking with maximum operational

490
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,879
director and he said

491
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,080
very insignificant number of people have

492
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,760
left the company what was about this

493
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,799
situation in april and may do you still

494
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,640
see outflow of i.t specialists due to

495
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,520
this tense geopolitical situation

496
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,919
well i would like to tell you that

497
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,440
before march we have observed outflow

498
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,440
and it is a normal outflow on the same

499
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,320
level it was a natural outflow on the

500
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,880
same level like it was happening last

501
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,200
year

502
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,679
after the february events we've seen a

503
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,280
lot of employees who wanted to live and

504
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,919
work in some other regions

505
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,440
and we've been providing them with this

506
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,080
opportunity

507
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,919
especially for those employees who've

508
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,240
been living some of them are returning

509
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,080
so nobody have left the company

510
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,720
so i think that in the nearest future

511
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,400
everything's going to be stabilized and

512
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,080
will come back to

513
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,280
pre

514
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,120
so you don't have any problems with

515
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,799
employees yes i understand that you need

516
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,320
new employees but there is no big

517
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,240
outflow no

518
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,320
right now we are actively hiring new

519
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,280
people and even it's a reverse situation

520
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,760
this growth of hiring which was

521
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,960
happening in the last four months

522
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,919
and we are closing the vacancies that we

523
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,360
have to us this is a positive trend that

524
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,200
we have not observed previously and this

525
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,320
is related to the fact that

526
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,440
a big number of employers leave russia

527
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,159
especially i.t companies and they

528
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,960
release big amount of good specialists

529
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,360
and we are inviting them to us and

530
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,480
that's what we are actually doing

531
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,880
after these events our state proposed

532
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,880
new benefits for it industry

533
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,840
i don't know of details i have not been

534
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,200
looking into this question have these

535
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,840
benefits been introduced but have you

536
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,039
tried to evaluate financial consequences

537
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,880
for your company from these benefits

538
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,320
because as i understand companies like

539
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,320
yours should be

540
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,640
first one wants to win from those

541
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,200
benefits provided to i.t people

542
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,840
of course positive technologies and

543
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,760
positive group

544
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,880
are

545
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,360
main beneficiaries of those benefits

546
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,520
because we are i.t company not just i.t

547
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,520
company but the development company so

548
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,880
benefits

549
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,840
which have been provided to at companies

550
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,080
last year they do cover those companies

551
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,200
which have more than 90 percent in the

552
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,799
structure of their revenue is the

553
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,720
revenue from

554
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,039
development and sales of their own

555
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,679
products so we are covered by this

556
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,640
category of benefits also this year they

557
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,360
provided additional benefits on profit

558
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,400
tax

559
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,039
profit tax

560
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,760
will work until the year 2025.

561
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,240
right now they discuss changes and

562
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,960
possibly there will be some additional

563
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,760
benefits and preferences for other types

564
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,320
of revenues for it companies because big

565
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,240
number of companies

566
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,840
don't have any possibilities of using

567
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,520
these benefits at the same time they

568
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,919
also are 80 companies and actively

569
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,080
invest and develop their products and we

570
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,919
need to support and keep their i.t

571
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,480
specialists also right now the state

572
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,960
have announced and starts working

573
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,000
with a program of support of beneficial

574
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,039
uh

575
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,400
i.t

576
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,600
support

577
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,080
of at companies and provide loans for a

578
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,559
system found in at companies those which

579
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,240
are in the least and positive

580
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,240
technologies also is in this list and

581
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,720
also additional benefit loans are

582
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,039
provided for the digitalization program

583
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,799
which is also a big program and for this

584
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,280
digitalization program we also see the

585
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,799
development of products and technology

586
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,640
as positive technologies that's why i

587
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,960
think that we will continue using these

588
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,799
benefits

589
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,640
you have not estimated this in numbers

590
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,960
how much this is five ten percent of

591
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,559
abda will be added by some benefits or

592
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,720
is it hard to believe well we've been

593
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,279
applying like three percent profit tax

594
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,240
uh and this year will have a zero rate

595
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,559
for profit tax and this is the effect

596
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,120
profit tax zero zero rate profit tax and

597
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,559
this is the main positive influence

598
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,840
right now from what can you evaluate

599
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,919
of course social

600
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,440
payments are reduced and we've been

601
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,159
applying them last year as well

602
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,919
it's going to be the same as previous

603
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,279
year

604
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,000
so it's everything is very good here but

605
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,880
we expect profit tax yeah this effect

606
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,720
has already been considered last year

607
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,880
and in addition to this one they will

608
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,880
reduce the profit tax and this is upon

609
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,840
the results of the year 2022 2023 2024.

610
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,200
okay we have another question from our

611
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,400
analytic

612
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,880
in your profit forecast you use some

613
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,080
range spread

614
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,200
at the given moment of time the forecast

615
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,760
for the year 2022 you see

616
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,240
closer to which side of this spread

617
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,679
every day from four to six billion

618
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,360
and profit-wise from two to

619
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,640
or five just keep the spread without any

620
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,440
yeah we are going to keep the spread

621
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,200
because right now it's still uh may and

622
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,960
from the point of view of the sales

623
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,679
results we still see april we don't see

624
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,520
the most important period q4

625
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,760
from one side we do have a lot of

626
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,200
positive trends on the market and we see

627
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,440
new segment a new niche that is being

628
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,760
released when big western players are

629
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,400
living this country an active growing

630
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,000
demand for

631
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,400
cyber security but on the other side we

632
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,840
do understand that there is a lot of

633
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,400
risks nobody can evaluate the economical

634
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,720
condition and in which direction our

635
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,240
economy is going to move how it's going

636
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,640
to be reflected on companies their

637
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,840
sustainability their budgets that's why

638
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,720
the q4 is going to be indicative so we

639
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,000
look in this future positively but more

640
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,600
precise assessments will be given

641
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,400
in our next event in the autumn

642
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,400

so that real actual results would be

645
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,760
even higher than the top level of your

646
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,880
forecasts so that your investors none of

647
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,480
