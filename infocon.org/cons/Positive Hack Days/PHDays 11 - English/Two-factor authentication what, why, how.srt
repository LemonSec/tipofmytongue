1
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,200
we all are surrounded with digital

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,519
devices and the result of

3
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,359
in action some inadmissible events might

4
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,480
happen

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,039
and it is very an important factor here

6
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,960
is that

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,680
the possibility of getting access

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,198
of a person to a service

9
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,679
and the more these stage of

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,280
communication between services and the

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,280
person is protected the lower is the

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,440
possibility that hacker can get through

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,079
and as one of the options

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,120
which

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,800
are present

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,440
to get access to a certain it's a double

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,360
factor authentication and we're going to

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,120
speak about it with victor chaching

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,559
operational director oh oh multi-factor

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,559
hello

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,879
dual factor authentication is not just a

22
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,879
dual factor but it's a multi-factor

23
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,239
authentication

24
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,119
because

25
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,560
every person should have several

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,479
entrance factors not just logging and

27
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,799
password login password and something

28
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,640
else and it's something else you should

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,119
have a lot of it so

30
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,880
this is a concept of development of the

31
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,360
multi-factor authentication and this is

32
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,159
the trendy and the best approach

33
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,640
in this area but people

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,799
are not ready

35
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,400
to use

36
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,560
something outside of regular uh

37
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,360
usb sticks or sms messages which from

38
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,960
the exploitation point of view are not

39
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,439
applicable to big organizations or

40
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,320
anything else

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,560
so the market is actively developing

42
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,960
from this point of view

43
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,799
okay let's speak about what is modern

44
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,799
dual factor authentication previously i

45
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,880
did have a certain token it was a big

46
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,000
usb stick i put it in a usb port and it

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,840
helped me to get logged into the

48
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,840
corporate network then i have certain

49
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,318
sms messages from bank services which

50
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,720
are coming to me in case when i do a

51
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,440
certain financial transaction

52
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,280
so in practical life i don't see any

53
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,879
other approaches but speaking about

54
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,599
corporate network we use your products

55
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,879
and corporate networks so i have an

56
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,520
application for

57
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,239
my mobile phone and by this application

58
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,160
i do confirm that i make a login in my

59
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,959
computer so can you tell me please how

60
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,640
the modern multi-factor authentication

61
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,000
works

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,319
okay let's begin with a simple one sms

63
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,120
messages why banks are sending sms

64
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,480
messages

65
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,360
because in order to get sms message you

66
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,599
need your mobile phone any mobile phone

67
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,599
it doesn't matter where is it located

68
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,280
even in a roaming

69
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,840
you can introduce this one-time code and

70
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,519
you can introduce it but you need to

71
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,280
have any type of communication but the

72
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,440
minus of these sms messages short

73
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,680
messages and since the year 2007 we know

74
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,800
that

75
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,879
they can be

76
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,400
catched

77
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,280
transacted by the base station or you

78
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,680
can send

79
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,879
these to a

80
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,720
group the wrong person and he will miss

81
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,280
the proper sms in the flow of those sms

82
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,480
messages

83
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,319
which come from the false base stations

84
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,480
it's a targeted attack against a certain

85
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,720
peace

86
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,599
it's not very expensive especially if

87
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,000
the user is not using this approach the

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,560
same bank

89
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,560
but if you will install bank application

90
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,400
the bank will stop sending your sms

91
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,239
messages and they will send push

92
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,480
messages yeah push messages they'll send

93
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,239
push messages because it's much cheaper

94
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,319
it's basically free of charge

95
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,958
for the company

96
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,280
because you have to pay mobile operator

97
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,760
for the sms message but for the push you

98
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,159
don't pay so all the banks are moving in

99
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,200
this direction speaking about the

100
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,360
corporate mobile applications

101
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,560
uh companies don't want to pay

102
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,280
three times a day if you enter somewhere

103
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,040
and three times you receive sms message

104
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,959
it means in uh

105
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,240
60 sms messages per month

106
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,400
it involves a lot of costs that's a

107
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,720
small thing but if you have 20 000

108
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,600
people that's a lot

109
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,080
everybody know how to count money so

110
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,160
they are moving to mobile applications

111
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,080
push messages and more and more

112
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,560
companies have those mobile applications

113
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,800
on the market

114
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,160
authentication service

115
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,320
is located inside of the corporate

116
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,560
perimeter

117
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,960
they still have their own applications

118
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,880
and then they send push messages no what

119
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,040
are the disadvantages and advantages of

120
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,280
the tokens you mean the hardware yeah

121
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,759
hardware tokens

122
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,600
like usb flashstick

123
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,720
they've been connected they showed that

124
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,560
they are like a keyboard then you

125
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,960
activate it and somehow

126
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,840
and then it pulls six digit code in the

127
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,239
field

128
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,240
which is required by the service but the

129
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,720
disadvantage is that

130
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,039
the minus of these codes that they can

131
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,960
be introduced anywhere if it's a web

132
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,840
application you can make any form you

133
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,000
want and you can add some additional

134
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,039
form

135
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,719
nice list you can make another process

136
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,479
you can type this one type code every

137
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,880
time and you don't have this field and

138
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,840
microsoft that didn't have this such

139
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,160
interface to

140
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,960
follow to the second factor

141
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,080
yeah

142
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,240
that's why all

143
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,600
one

144
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,520
approaches they do not work with it and

145
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,400
coming back to our hardware tokens

146
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,720
what's so bad about the keyboard

147
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,759
emulator

148
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,759
its data can be

149
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,840
uh intercepted

150
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,960
and the

151
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,639
software on the computer can intercept

152
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,680
this data and broadcast this data to his

153
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,120
own owner

154
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,840
to get this remote access

155
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,120
second of all

156
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,919
tokens can be broken easily

157
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,039
people are losing them people break them

158
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,080
they constantly forget them

159
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,120
so british

160
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,319
companies have switched

161
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,039
to

162
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,759
software tokens

163
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,039
yeah software tokens when in your mobile

164
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,639
device you

165
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,280
install google authenticator

166
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,000
or one of those thousands uh

167
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,680
programs which generate one-time codes

168
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,120
and you use it

169
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,400
as lucifer those disposable codes what

170
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,000
are the advantages the advantage is that

171
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,919
your mobile phone is always with you you

172
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,880
are not going to forget it

173
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,240
it's always been charged

174
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,800
so factors

175
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,039
the factor of losing it and breaking it

176
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,759
is becomes becomes secondary

177
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,479
however the disadvantage is that this

178
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,639
one time code has to be introduced

179
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,120
somewhere and on a step-by-step basis

180
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,840
everybody is moving to push messages and

181
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,440
mobile applications

182
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,240
that

183
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,520
you shouldn't type anything

184
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,280
and the exchange

185
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,280
well this service receives a request

186
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,560
from the hardware that i would like to

187
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,280
connect this user this user

188
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,319
signs

189
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,520
with his own digital signature then it's

190
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,160
sent to the user user confirms with a

191
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,599
button that i agree and then

192
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,160
everything dot is being done in both

193
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,120
directions and even interface free

194
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,520
connections allow us to do something

195
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,440
like that because the interface is on

196
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,000
the side of the user

197
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,000
you can just press the connection button

198
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,199
and you have some login password you

199
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,879
have some smart card connected to your

200
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,280
computer so you're getting connected the

201
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,879
push message goes to your mobile

202
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,639
application mobile application you press

203
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,159
the button and then you get connected

204
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,399
is that every session is signed

205
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,399
differently with its own timestamp with

206
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,640
its own

207
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,120
like that with its own keys

208
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,200
so this is a great advantage from the

209
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,800
point of view of

210
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,360
interception

211
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,160
and changing it

212
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,560
so this is the current development of

213
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,959
this situation and honestly speaking

214
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,560
from the point of view of the user

215
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,600
experience for me as the dual level

216
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,839
authentication user this is kind of an

217
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,399
extra operation for me for example when

218
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,480
bank sends push message

219
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,080
to confirm financial transaction

220
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,120
it's a seamless process because i

221
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,800
immediately see this push in bank

222
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,200
application it's enough for me just to

223
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,800
press this button and then i see the

224
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,240
operation it's very convenient and

225
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,360
normal but in a case if

226
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,760
this is a software token to get access

227
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,760
into corporate network you have to enter

228
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,160
mobile phone

229
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,880
so this is extra extra step

230
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,040
factor are there any trends which can

231
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,760
simplify this dual factor authentication

232
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,839
or replace it by some other approach

233
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,360
well there's an interesting trend

234
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,839
from one of our market colleagues i've

235
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,600
seen it their main product

236
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,079
is the entrance into the operation

237
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,040
system the logon screen

238
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,440
and they replace it completely by their

239
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,160
own solution

240
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,839
and in a number of it works with a

241
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,640
number of operation systems os's so the

242
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,320
story is that you approach the device

243
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,079
and instead of uh

244
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,560
giving passport and logging on your

245
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,480
mobile phone you say i would like to get

246
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,360
connected to these uh computer and you

247
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,560
get authorized without entering any data

248
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,839
or anything

249
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,320
so it's like 1.5 uh actual

250
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,160
authentication it's not a russian

251
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,519
developer it's a foreign company

252
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,279
this is a very interesting story because

253
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,920
basically all your credentials are

254
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,160
stored in your mobile phone

255
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,360
plus you do confirm logging in your

256
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,360
mobile phone by the biometrics at least

257
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,200
is being used by this phone so it's a

258
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,160
very good trend however

259
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,880
it requires replacement of a certain

260
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,640
basic os components

261
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,880
and we know

262
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,000
that current oss

263
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,920
they do have a lot of bugs and if you

264
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,240
replace it by something else

265
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,360
it's not a fact that you will completely

266
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,720
replace the security side of it

267
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,959
especially for the remote access or for

268
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,000
local access as well

269
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,200
so the main meaning of this multi-factor

270
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,760
authentication is that

271
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,079
we should see the separation between

272
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,000
different methods of authentication and

273
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,920
speaking about physical methods that

274
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,639
your credentials are stored in one place

275
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,200
you go to that place uh confirmation is

276
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,320
done in another place and you show that

277
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,000
you confirm

278
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,320
uh so that all these pieces are

279
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,880
connected into the same chain this is

280
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,480
the main idea and this is the main

281
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,880
fissure

282
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,720
you cannot hold all the eggs in the same

283
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,560
basket well on the level of operational

284
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,839
system they should be sold yeah

285
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,800
however we have based a development of

286
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,680
such logan screen for windows

287
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,160
and it did have so many

288
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,399
stumbling blocks

289
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,880
that we had to use uh dirty hacking

290
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,880
to understand the behavior of the system

291
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,360
by default

292
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,760
that was a curious story in the server

293
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,480
2008

294
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,120
it was a 32-bit server

295
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,360
it has not allowed to use third-party

296
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,360
authentication methods and in the case

297
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,120
if it's a goo id guid

298
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,079
rus graphic user identificator for all

299
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,480
these methods of identification if it's

300
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,440
if the

301
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,200
guid

302
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,000
is uh smaller than any other methods

303
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
well all the identification methods in

304
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,480
this system especially in windows they

305
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,720
have their own identifier

306
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,600
i know it's called guid

307
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,839
graphic

308
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,279
programmer

309
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,160
it's a software identifier inside of the

310
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,040
it's like 24 digit

311
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,519
number

312
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,000
can be a word

313
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,639
consisting of digits and letters

314
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,880
speaking about the uh biometrics and

315
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,920
dual factor authentication the retina

316
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,839
the phase finger print

317
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,160
no it doesn't have any place

318
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,160
well let's see

319
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,000
we have to understand that there's

320
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,639
another story as strong and weak

321
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,360
authentication

322
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,720
i do meet my colleagues once uh in a

323
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,560
while and we've been involved in

324
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,399
mathematical

325
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,839
justification of all these

326
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,519
authentication methods and they said

327
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,760
that modern sensors which are installed

328
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,199
in our mobile phones it's uh

329
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,680
you mean this biometrics yeah these

330
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,680
fingerprints this is

331
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,720
not operational because

332
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,399
basically speaking for the same

333
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,519
fingerprint in order to determine with

334
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,560
100

335
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,800
accuracy that this person is that

336
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,399
particular person who is the owner of

337
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,959
this finger you need to have a full

338
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,279
scale full size

339
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,000
scan of his fingerprint not less than

340
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,480
one centimeter in the

341
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,600
square mirrors well the apple's

342
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,760
fingerprint is very small

343
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,519
but right now

344
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,720
apple and

345
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,199
the recent phones they have

346
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,600
well it's much better about the face id

347
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,120
because the face id

348
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,760
happens with the consideration of the

349
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,560
depth it's not just any picture that can

350
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,760
be put in here

351
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,240
but a 3g model of the face has been

352
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,079
built

353
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,000
so

354
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,639
speaking about precision it's less than

355
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,839
one per thousand

356
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,720
so precision of uh

357
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,920
discovery so when false discovery of

358
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,399
phase can be out of 1 000 spaces

359
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,240
so one files out of 1000.

360
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,240
there could be one false positive and

361
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,120
this is sufficient for authentication to

362
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,360
be weak

363
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,440
and a person with a good makeup can

364
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,519
look like a real yeah you can make a

365
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,839
makeup and the person will look like

366
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,079
without any specific additional

367
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,480
cheekbones and other things when the

368
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,880
face becomes thicker or thinner with

369
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,240
special

370
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,680
face cheeks

371
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,880
under skin

372
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,439
commandments

373
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,759
so as one of the additional

374
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,680
authentication methods

375
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,720
it can be used but from the point of

376
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,040
view of full access to some critical

377
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,279
systems unfortunately

378
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,759
current sensors which are widely

379
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,600
proliferated market they are not

380
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,079
applicable

381
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,240
yes there are some certain specialized

382
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,440
solutions for example

383
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,959
when speaking about your foreign

384
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,800
passport or visa when you submit your

385
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,000
fingerprints it has a big

386
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,959
sensor with big scanner and it scans

387
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,479
your whole finger

388
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,519
so this is a specialized solution which

389
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,720
is very expensive

390
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,279
um

391
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,160
[Music]

392
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,559
much are we ready to pay

393
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,160
in order not to lose more but i would

394
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,359
like to ask you a question multi-factor

395
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:13,919
authentication of any type like sms or

396
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,000
biometrics

397
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,599
it still

398
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,640
has a certain storage location

399
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,679
for this information

400
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,720
this authentication information where

401
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,720
your fingerprints

402
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,960
face authentication yeah authentication

403
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,360
storage

404
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,600
honestly i'm afraid to scan my face

405
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,360
sometimes they have this

406
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,400
face paint

407
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,480
i'm afraid of it because i'm afraid that

408
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,080
my face is going to be stored in some

409
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,720
database why do they need my face in

410
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,320
this database and somebody will break

411
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,480
into this database and will immediately

412
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,720
get access to all those beautiful faces

413
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,880
of millions of people

414
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,039
the storage by itself of this

415
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,440
multi-factor authentication how well are

416
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,360
they protected and are there any

417
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,720
precedents of hackers breaking into them

418
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,240
well once again

419
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,799
there are cloud services of

420
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,039
authentication there are local services

421
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,039
of authentication

422
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,280
something in local services of

423
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,360
authentication well nobody knows what

424
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,280
happens within them

425
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,440
in local ones but speaking about the

426
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,039
cloud authentication services

427
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,880
i don't know of well known leaks in

428
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,520
recent 10 years there was not a single

429
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,400
leak

430
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,960
from this database so they are strong

431
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,080
well logins and passwords from certain

432
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,600
services they

433
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,760
are regularly being stolen but when you

434
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,760
do authentication

435
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,360
you become very careful and you follow

436
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,000
how you do it

437
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,919
because this is something which is

438
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,360
related to storage of critically

439
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,320
important data

440
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,039
which gives access to very

441
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,160
sensitive systems

442
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,640
we've been making our own service we've

443
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,400
been looking at the pci dss standard

444
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,200
which is involved for the uh card data

445
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,240
storage

446
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,919
just because

447
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,280
we had this story in our life previously

448
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,200
in the previous 20 years we've been

449
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,840
manufacturing payment services and right

450
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,240
now we have authentication services in

451
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,960
addition to that we have reinforced

452
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,960
additionally

453
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,120
and we apply practices which are helped

454
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,520
by our partners that

455
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,760
some things

456
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,600
have to be done this way

457
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,760
other things have to be done another way

458
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,400
i cannot tell you what we've been doing

459
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,440
exactly however we're constantly

460
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,679
learning we're constantly improving our

461
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,480
system we're constantly

462
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,679
matching it

463
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:08,400
and

464
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,559
due to recent events

465
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,760
we had to replicate well not replicate

466
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,720
but we had to close the story with dns

467
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,159
because we did have a story that dns

468
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,799
hosted where we've been placed they've

469
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,000
been under constant attack

470
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,919
and half of rule net was

471
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:32,960
broken

472
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,200
so additionally from this point of view

473
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,360
have your service suffered from it

474
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,760
no we didn't have any downtime

475
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,360
because there's a certain cache

476
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,039
in a result in the name result

477
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,000
and in most of the time

478
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,760
most of the clients

479
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,799
they didn't see even any hitches

480
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,799
or hindrances but only one of them have

481
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,640
noticed that something didn't work

482
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,000
because

483
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,559
they had cash update like one minute in

484
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,678
the dns and

485
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,039
in one minute after everything has been

486
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,080
shut down it stopped being resolved as

487
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,919
the whole internet

488
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,600
okay victor

489
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,000
you have not

490
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,640
classified me by saying that no

491
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,480
authentication services have been broken

492
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,039
last night yes well to me it's like a

493
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,480
green signal

494
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,520
that don't be afraid and you can play

495
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,120
with your face

496
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,320
well you also have to understand that

497
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,720
inside of this service they don't store

498
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,280
your biometric information

499
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,000
they store digital

500
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,440
print

501
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,760
not a photo but an encoding keys

502
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,600
and the end device

503
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,720
does the discovery of the image

504
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,400
when it's being transported into a

505
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,840
certain digital matrix

506
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,559
biometrics are not going to leak out it

507
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,200
stays locally any device which does the

508
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,760
scanning okay thank you very much victor

509
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,840
for an interesting interview and i

510
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,400
desire your company to be successful in

511
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,440
russian and other markets and i do hope

512
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,840
that because of these years

513
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,880
you will have more possibilities and the

514
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,559
market for

515
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,200
its

516
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,919
discovery what is very important

517
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,640
we shouldn't lose the power of

518
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,720
development within it because the

519
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,880
reduction of the competition

520
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,200
foreign companies are leaving the market

521
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,120
and we can get higher access to the

522
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,360
market but you shouldn't relax too much

523
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,760
and the product should not become worse

524
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,400
we did hear very interesting uh dual

525
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,320
factor authentication examples one from

526
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,080
your mobile phone

527
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,880
you can not even having access to the

528
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,720
laptop and you can make such

529
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,559
identification and we have a lot of

530
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,200
examples i wanted this multi-factor

531
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,919
authentication and it should be seamless

532
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,280
and simple for the end user so i wish

533
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,480
you to achieve such success thank you
