1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,439
hi everyone

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,560
let's start there's not enough time

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,920
my name is alexander luonov

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,160
and i'll be talking today about the new

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,719
reality of information security

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:15,679
and

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,840
how it affects the vulnerability

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,359
management

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,600
i do vulnerability management since 2009

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,920
quite a while i have a blog a telegram

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,279
channel

12
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,640
of course yeah

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,519
please subscribe and like

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:32,479
and

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,680
let's start from afar

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,360
starting in the beginning of uh

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,800
november

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,640
2021

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,039
on the standoff we were asked if you

20
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,480
could recommend a big vendor

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,960
that is uh you know prominent in the

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,520
country what would you advise so that

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,360
the info security improves and my advice

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,839
would be

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,000
i was giving those advice

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,840
because i thought

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,280
it was

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,799
important

29
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,360
that the base scanner gets cheaper

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,439
because we all know if you know if you

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,640
purchase

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,880
uh asset-based

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,479
vulnerability solutions then

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,840
it's too too high

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,640
cost the same time the transparency of

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,479
knowledge bases should increase so that

37
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,680
we could

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,520
compare

39
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,960
which scanners can detect what

40
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,439
what they cannot detect

41
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,479
and depending on that

42
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,799
to understand

43
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,119
what is

44
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,960
the right way to choose the correct

45
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,680
solution on the market

46
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,399
and of course we'd want the vendors to

47
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,520
pay more attention to

48
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,079
fixing the vulnerabilities

49
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,200
because currently it's like yeah it's

50
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,119
been detected

51
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,479
here's the vendor bulletin and you know

52
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,959
you're on your own

53
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,920
on february this year

54
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,599
it was a terrible security day

55
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,959
conference officially a russian one but

56
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:19,760
no

57
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,319
vendor representatives were of course

58
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,120
there and i took part and

59
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,840
explained

60
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,680
the ideas of

61
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,280
knowledge based transparency nasa's

62
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,840
openvs what is supported by which

63
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,720
if you are interested

64
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,120
please feel free to have a look it was

65
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,280
done by my open source tool

66
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,840
it was good

67
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,560
but now it starts in february

68
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,319
in april and may there's no license

69
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,200
there's no support

70
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,560
for russian users

71
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,879
and even the side is blocked

72
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,120
so this is of course just one of

73
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,959
the episodes of what has happened in

74
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,200
february

75
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,440
in reality

76
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,280
a lot of info security vendors have left

77
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,040
and we understand we cannot trust them

78
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,840
because

79
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,000
their functionality can degrade very

80
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,200
fast

81
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,840
the updates can be

82
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,319
blocked our support and

83
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,599
you won't get any money back

84
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,400
and with open source the situation is

85
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,280
also not very beautiful because

86
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,040
we saw open source projects having

87
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,440
malware

88
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,359
a good example was node apc

89
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,840
that had a vibe viper in it

90
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,319
in most projects we just saw some

91
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,120
political proclamations but anyway it's

92
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,200
not that terrible but it

93
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,959
shows you you know

94
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,560
who has control over the project

95
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,879
and what they will do if they'd like to

96
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,079
make something

97
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,440
malicious

98
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,400
so let's focus on commercial solutions

99
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,479
how does this situation affect

100
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,320
vulnerability management

101
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,840
it definitely does

102
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,520
if you chose your vulnerability

103
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,840
management product by functionality

104
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,120
comparing forester or gardner

105
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,960
it's currently

106
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,560
you know

107
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,720
a pumpkin doesn't work

108
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,759
if you didn't

109
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,080
happy

110
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,080
fixing the vulnerabilities

111
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,320
imagine you've detected them so how do

112
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,400
you fix them

113
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,560
there's a chance that with each update

114
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,880
the functionality will degrade and part

115
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,400
of your infrastructure

116
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,360
will

117
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,400
turn into a pumpkin

118
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,360
choosing this solution

119
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,199
if in the last year i was

120
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,320
talking about

121
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,080
functional requirements technical

122
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,680
requirements

123
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,759
and now vulnerability management

124
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,320
products requirements are just very down

125
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,320
to the ground

126
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,440
it's good already if you have one

127
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,039
if it's available it's already good

128
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,479
the knowledge bases should be updated

129
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,479
and if there's some customer support

130
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,440
also great you know if you can talk to a

131
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,039
vendor saying you know i have false

132
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,520
whatever

133
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,240
and all the rest is pretty much

134
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,880
everything goes

135
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,759
vendor stability

136
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,639
how can you how can we formulate this

137
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,840
there are some external events

138
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,719
can be either formal or informal

139
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,840
including

140
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,840
condemnation of the company in the media

141
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,319
sanctions

142
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,280
against the country for example

143
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,280
or against the management

144
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,559
or in the worst case

145
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,280
secondary sanctions

146
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,960
that

147
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,880
can make the vendor

148
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,280
degrade their stability

149
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,600
uh of their solutions

150
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,960
starting from blocking some

151
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,039
functionality

152
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,080
and up to and including

153
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,560
the fact that your software or hardware

154
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,280
stops working

155
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,599
and what is worse

156
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,520
if your data are leaked

157
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,639
so what do you do in that case

158
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,199
no idea

159
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,240
if we gather those

160
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,680
external events and uh

161
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,360
we might create

162
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,759
this type of table and compare their

163
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,120
stability

164
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,840
the trust is

165
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,840
it's a different word in russia but at

166
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,800
least let's say stability so that you

167
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,120
can you could protect yourself from the

168
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,280
fact that the vendor starts

169
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,638
evil activity against you

170
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,880
if last year i said that

171
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,840
on ph days conference

172
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,199
with prioritization i had a slide

173
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,400
that said

174
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,440
guys

175
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,080
it's better not to prioritize to trust

176
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,960
the vendor to install the

177
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,800
updates if the vendor has

178
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,280
issued a bullet and then he knows that

179
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,440
it should be fixed and you just need a

180
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,360
regular patching process not the

181
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,520
prioritization because

182
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,639
it can give you some mistakes

183
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,479
now i cannot

184
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,919
put it like this

185
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,840
i'd say that if the vendor is stable

186
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,319
you'd better patch if the vendor is

187
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,680
unstable

188
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,080
then you need to be smart about how you

189
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,560
approach the process and prioritize the

190
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,400
vulnerability

191
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,360
whether they need to be patched

192
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,679
or you know some walk around should be

193
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,079
issued

194
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,120
for the second process we even have some

195
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,958
kind of a

196
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,159
guiding principle

197
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,560
one of them is

198
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,880
nk cki

199
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,839
bulletin

200
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,640
describing

201
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,120
and giving recommendations on how you

202
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,120
can make solutions about whether you

203
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,399
should update the product

204
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,479
to fix some issue or not

205
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,200
it's not detailed enough and we will not

206
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,959
dive deeply into

207
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,279
this process but i just wanted to show

208
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,519
it to you to give you an understanding

209
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,600
of which properties

210
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,399
which parameters take part in the

211
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,959
decision making and are taking into

212
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,560
consideration

213
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,480
whether you should batch something or

214
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,720
not

215
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,200
unfortunately my clicker doesn't work so

216
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,839
the next slide

217
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,040
here are some prams

218
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,959
connected to the vulnerability itself

219
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,279
whether exploit is available

220
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,279
vulnerability type rclp us

221
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,760
base core

222
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,519
quite a big one

223
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,880
and whether you can exploit the

224
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,959
this one in the wild it's not in the

225
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,439
bulletin

226
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,040
i do i do use all those programs in my

227
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,600
open source utility heuristics so you

228
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,120
can have a look at it

229
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,839
next slide please

230
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,320
i know the previous one now

231
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,880
good

232
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,200
cool

233
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,600
so what i wanted to say here is there

234
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,160
are some other

235
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,399
params connected to the net with the

236
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,200
network whether the vulnerability is

237
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,000
available on the perimeter

238
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,680
whether the host is critical

239
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,120
if the host is critical then

240
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,519
some critical data is processed on the

241
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,839
host

242
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,279
you should also take into account

243
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,040
whether some protective mechanisms are

244
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,760
implemented do you have vdrs

245
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,160
that enable you to

246
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,000
detect and

247
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,480
stop the vulnerability

248
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,079
and if

249
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,600
during the vulnerability patching

250
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,920
process the service stops what happens

251
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,720
then

252
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,519
next slide please

253
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,279
additional requirements for

254
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,640
by the way this

255
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,240
bulletin

256
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,480
has a lot of descriptions of what you

257
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,920
should do if you need to take the

258
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,320
context into account

259
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,839
you need to

260
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,640
check for the updates by yourself if you

261
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,880
can

262
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,640
you don't need to put all the updates at

263
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,279
once you should first you know use the

264
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,800
test scope

265
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,480
and of course this works with the

266
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,480
commercial solutions doesn't work with

267
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,320
some other solutions it

268
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,360
talks about the um

269
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,360
mission critical systems

270
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,399
hence

271
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,040
i'd like to say that yeah this is a

272
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,839
difficult thing this is a complex story

273
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,040
and

274
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,839
this type of prioritization needs a lot

275
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,240
of data about the infrastructure you

276
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,639
should be taking into account

277
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,040
not only the activity but infrastructure

278
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,519
itself not technical but also business

279
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,040
infrastructure

280
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,639
that's why

281
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,440
you might need to reduce the amount of

282
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,720
unstable vectors and increase the amount

283
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,639
of stable vectors

284
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,480
so that you could switch to regular

285
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,519
patching

286
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,560
instead of

287
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,839
just doing

288
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,120
a complex

289
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,720
prioritization

290
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,720
so that in the end

291
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,440
by say 2025

292
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,800
we have less unstable vendors in the

293
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,800
infrastructure

294
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,760
and with that i'd like to conclude with

295
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,639
the fact that the new reality of cyber

296
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,160
security definitely affects

297
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,399
the

298
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,399
situation because right now you need to

299
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,480
assess the vendor stability something

300
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,079
that we could avoid doing right now it's

301
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,839
super important

302
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,399
unstable vendors have an issue of not

303
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,959
when of us not being able to assess the

304
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,760
vulnerability and fix it so

305
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,680
we

306
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,880
clearly need to

307
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,680
make changes and of course the fact that

308
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,279
those extreme uh issues you know that

309
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,800
are highlighted very seriously in russia

310
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,279
they uh that experience will be

311
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,600
exportable and important

312
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,040
for

313
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,160
uh many of us and including monetization

314
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,440
thank you indeed for your attention and

315
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,959
please come to my

316
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,880
uh my channels and

317
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,760
you know

318
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,120
give me likes and subscribe

319
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,639
subscriptions

320
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,839
any questions

321
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,800
hello thanks thanks indeed for the

322
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,440
presentation

323
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,160
as part of your work did you develop

324
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,279
some

325
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,199
instability rating for the vendors

326
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,399
no specific companies

327
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,839
[Music]

328
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,199
but if the company says

329
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,839
they will you know stop their licenses

330
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,480
and block functionality then first of

331
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,399
all this is important to

332
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,600
monitor

333
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,079
this is very important to close the

334
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,479
access

335
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,320
to for this company

336
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,360
you know

337
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,959
to their servers so that they cannot

338
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,000
harm us

339
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,839
at

340
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,839
least and moreover

341
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,600
it's great that the regulator has

342
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,240
changed their position on the fact and

343
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,760
instead of prohibiting updates which is

344
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,560
not

345
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,279
a very good thing and impossible to to

346
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,800
implement currently

347
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,600
with the new critical vulnerabilities

348
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,320
exploitable

349
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,360
so that they change it to correct

350
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,360
prioritization

351
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,120
and i think this

352
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,240
this is the writing

353
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,759
i see hand there

354
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,320
thank you indeed for your presentation

355
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,959
the question was about the mission

356
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,199
critical systems so we have a lot of

357
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,440
critical vulnerabilities and what would

358
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,199
you like to

359
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,839
what would you recommend in that

360
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,079
situation yeah it was a

361
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,680
important topic

362
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,480
and

363
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,440
you cannot scan and detect in in that

364
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,320
area and

365
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,560
you need to to

366
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,440
analyze traffic and

367
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,639
well maybe in the current situation

368
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,839
in the current conditions

369
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,519
with hopefully

370
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,600
still

371
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,720
patching is still available but it's

372
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,040
complicated more complicated and testing

373
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,040
is complicated

374
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,040
i think an important thing is isolation

375
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,160
and hope

376
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,800
for the situation to improve as part of

377
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,680
impersonal substitution

378
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,120
ideally we would be able to you know

379
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,240
substitute those systems but giving any

380
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,800
specific recommendations is a hard thing

381
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
to do

382
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,680
yeah another question

383
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,560
good evening

384
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,959
my question is are there any qualitative

385
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,480
or quantitative

386
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,679
methods for measuring the trust level or

387
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,640
stability level

388
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,438
for the vendor

389
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,559
because you could trust one vendor but

390
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,880
tomorrow they will say or do something

391
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,880
so

392
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,120
you cannot say you cannot put 100 trust

393
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,720
on a company

394
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,200
some will be more stable like russian

395
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,280
vendors for example working only in

396
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,360
russia

397
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,840
that don't have any foreign offices

398
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,200
will be more stable and

399
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,280
will be less dependent on sanctions and

400
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,520
secondary sanctions

401
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,640
rather than

402
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,360
say american vendors

403
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,919
but there's some area in the middle

404
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,039
i don't know israel

405
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,039
israeli-based vendors are still

406
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,039
represented in the russian market and i

407
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,280
don't know for how long this will

408
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,120
be true but at least for now it's true

409
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,440
quantitative

410
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,200
analysis is

411
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,679
hard i did not try to come up with some

412
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:24,960
formula

413
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,240
each and every organization should

414
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,360
decide for themselves

415
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,159
how they monitor that stability level

416
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,360
but i think this is now

417
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,399
something that we need to do

418
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,720
and we need to put it into these

419
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,679
substitution plans also

420
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,520
because otherwise

421
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,760
this

422
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,679
you know

423
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,160
at the moment of denial of service of

424
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,000
course this will be

425
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,640
very painful

426
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,080
one more question

427
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,520
so as we now know the reputation is the

428
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,760
new currency

429
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,320
and

430
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,600
it's was very much highlighted so should

431
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,000
we wait for some specific registry

432
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,240
of you know black lists white lists from

433
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,160
the regulator

434
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,360
i don't know

435
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,039
that would be cool

436
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,280
such a list would help me

437
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,840
if they if it is a recommendation this

438
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,039
is great if it's not mandatory and if it

439
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,039
has the reasons why

440
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,200
this or that vendor

441
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,039
is in the list

442
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,600
that would be useful information that we

443
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,080
will take into account when deciding on

444
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,760
the information security policy for our

445
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,760
company

446
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,360
there's a list of certified solutions

447
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,280
there's a list of accredited solutions

448
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,360
but that's not exactly what i what i

449
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,880
mean by

450
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,640
my stability

451
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,320
so this is like

452
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,799
half of the solution

453
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,120
with that i'd like to conclude thank you

454
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,200
for your attention and please feel free

455
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,320
to come to me and
