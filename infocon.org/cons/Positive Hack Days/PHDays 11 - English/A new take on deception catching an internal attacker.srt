1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,240
i'm xenia i'm working in our vision as

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,919
an analyst

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:08,800
and

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,160
to speak simply i help develop

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,280
the sense

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,599
technological platform we are going to

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,039
talk about

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,240
our vision

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,520
products to which i do not relate i did

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,960
not

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,720
get involved in the development but you

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,439
may familiarize with it at the booth

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,279
there will be no marketing part in my

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,199
presentation so those of you who wanted

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:31,920
that

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,360
go elsewhere anyway

17
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,160
[Music]

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,680
why did i

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,200
decide to go for this topic

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,320
for me as an analyst

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,239
pains of an

22
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,039
ordinary security

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,520
guy became a parent and so i decided to

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,160
tackle that pain because the insiders

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,159
have always been with us

26
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,519
they

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,760
will stay with us but

28
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,200
it's not been

29
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,600
quite possible to eradicate them that

30
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,760
efficiently so far what are the

31
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,920
violators let's just

32
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,000
check them out let's just check the

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
insiders

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,680
as sources as one of major sources

35
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,040
of such leakages

36
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,799
let's just take a look at

37
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,439
the investigation and then later in the

38
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,840
end i will speak about deception and the

39
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,040
conclusions everybody knows about

40
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,799
hackers attacking us

41
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,560
so

42
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,159
we start

43
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,159
learning

44
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,799
and

45
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,640
we find the tactics

46
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,960
and when we try to exchange the data

47
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,719
but the more we fight

48
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,199
violators

49
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,759
inside

50
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,040
it's the people who work with us

51
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,760
who would like to

52
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,760
protect

53
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,080
so the first thing that i would like to

54
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,239
talk about is one of the recent

55
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,440
leakages so who was responsible for that

56
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,800
he was responsible for that

57
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,959
so

58
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,800
on march the 1st uh jan daxida published

59
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,720
this

60
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,800
notification about

61
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,080
the leak

62
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,519
of the

63
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,200
customer data so they were real unhappy

64
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,720
the

65
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,159
external

66
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,560
violator was revealed

67
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,640
so there are plenty

68
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,079
of violations

69
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,560
there have been many many of them and

70
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,800
previously there had been many of them

71
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,280
so there are such leaks and

72
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,760
they always

73
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,000
will be there so they would like to ask

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,120
you a question

75
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,080
why

76
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,120
so

77
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,440
so if we take a look at the data on

78
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,519
april the 21st

79
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,400
the

80
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,120
masquerade

81
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,959
yandex for 50 000 rubles for violating

82
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,080
the personal data

83
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,920
law so

84
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,200
we can

85
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,519
live with it really

86
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,879
so if we take

87
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,599
into account the statistics one of the

88
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,720
reports of the vendors

89
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,200
approximately 80 percent

90
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,080
are

91
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,599
internal violators so those hackers

92
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,640
who have been attacking us

93
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,480
are not

94
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,799
the ones as internal

95
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,400
violators

96
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,720
so somebody says no

97
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,120
this cannot be so we just need to sell

98
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,120
dlp solutions so that's what they did

99
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,960
so i decided to run my own

100
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,440
study

101
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,080
the numbers are very similar the

102
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,040
question

103
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,560
sounded really

104
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,360
similar so the russian mentality says

105
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,759
that uh everything people would like to

106
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,240
take and people would like to own is

107
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,759
just like the stands that you are

108
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,840
passing by with some pens or with the

109
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,720
note pads i don't really know why people

110
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,120
need them but they grab them

111
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,240
so they bring everything home

112
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,040
so there is some information that i

113
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,040
would like to store

114
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,840
so

115
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,000
maybe i would like to

116
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,039
use it at my next job so it may be very

117
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,240
useful

118
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,680
so if you really would like to

119
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,280
participate

120
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,120
there

121
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,479
if you

122
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,280
would like to say that i'm wrong please

123
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,840
follow that link and i'll be delighted

124
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,039
to read your

125
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,320
replies

126
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,840
anyway

127
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,360
so let's just

128
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,520
check what the real data says

129
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,320
i was just digressing a little bit

130
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,600
so i was trying to get into

131
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,199
the reports

132
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:35,919
of

133
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,440
one of the

134
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,639
banks it's a giant banks burbank

135
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,400
and approximately

136
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,360
200 people there is just one incident a

137
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,240
year occurring so that's not

138
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,800
the study that's the incident which has

139
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,960
been confirmed

140
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,039
and i'd asked

141
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,639
my colleagues and the practice showed

142
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,840
that there is such practice

143
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,400
so what does the legislation say

144
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,360
if

145
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,039
the person really

146
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,840
disclosed the data if it's just some

147
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,280
kind of a

148
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,080
secret maybe it's commercial data

149
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,000
professional data

150
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,240
the contract may be rescinded based upon

151
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,720
article 81 labor code of the russian

152
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,639
federation but unfortunately it's not

153
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,280
that simple these days

154
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,360
in order to fire an individual you

155
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,880
should have valid

156
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,000
reasons

157
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,319
weighty reasons so they just need to

158
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,919
disclose

159
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,919
something really serious

160
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,160
if you see that this person say

161
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,720
here is that celery of mine and you

162
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,120
would say how come you're saying that

163
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,840
it's a commercial

164
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,080
so it seems like that the salary is not

165
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,319
the commercial secret otherwise would be

166
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,680
disclosing

167
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,039
this commercial secret each time we get

168
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,160
a visa so there is no disclosure of the

169
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,800
commercial secret at all

170
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,440
sharing your salary and also the person

171
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,400
should sign an nda

172
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,759
they should understand clearly that

173
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,960
this company has

174
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,440
data that cannot be disclosed and

175
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,440
they need to put

176
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,680
a signature there so if it's not done

177
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,440
like that

178
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,599
people just didn't know

179
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:26,319
and

180
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,720
then just need to prove that they had

181
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,280
disclosed that

182
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,080
and

183
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,639
if you cannot prove that

184
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,919
this person has nothing to do with that

185
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:38,880
so

186
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,800
there was a leakage so

187
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,440
what do we do with that

188
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,800
the first thing we do

189
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,680
is the actual disclosure

190
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,199
so

191
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,639
we have

192
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,560
a way

193
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,080
to find

194
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,479
that there was a kind of a leakage of

195
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,599
such

196
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,039
data

197
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:01,759
so

198
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,759
an order is issued about

199
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,199
the checkup

200
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,199
about the incidents

201
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,599
checkup not about the person's checkup

202
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,199
because if we cannot

203
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,520
collect the evidence

204
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,440
if we cannot

205
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,240
give real

206
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,319
value

207
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,400
from that

208
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,800
we would be too late and after that a

209
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,479
commission is set up made up of three

210
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,719
people and they hr

211
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,880
an expert

212
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,880
and

213
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,080
and the security

214
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,360
expert they collect explanations a

215
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,040
written explanation there should be a

216
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,120
written explanation provided

217
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,399
uh not

218
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,360
from

219
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,480
the guilty one but also those ones that

220
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,080
can be useful there then a certain

221
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,959
decision is made

222
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,560
so if this person

223
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,560
has been has committed a petty crime

224
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,240
like stole a pen or a pencil it's okay

225
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,519
but the severity and the aggravation uh

226
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,800
should be

227
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,720
solid enough

228
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,040
for further steps to conduct

229
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,480
and then

230
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,000
the ceo gets this report on his desk

231
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,480
they'd see what is happening what is

232
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,680
going on and they can

233
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,040
have a disciplinary

234
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
measures

235
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,399
i think you understand

236
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,120
that this process is very complicated

237
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,399
and

238
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,720
if we missed

239
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,040
something if we did not collect

240
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,880
something

241
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,600
it may happen that this person will

242
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,480
prove

243
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,640
his innocence and

244
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,399
all the work that he had been doing for

245
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,640
months would be

246
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,680
done for nothing so how come deception

247
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,640
kicks in we're talking about insiders or

248
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,200
we're talking about how to protect from

249
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,680
the internal violator

250
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,320
so for those of you who are not aware of

251
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,760
such a class

252
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,800
of a solution deception is

253
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,760
based upon this

254
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,079
deceit

255
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,120
concept we have

256
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,640
attractions

257
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,600
and

258
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,920
traps attractions

259
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,440
are the ones

260
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,200
possessed at servers and if a hacker

261
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,560
finds this

262
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,079
and just need to check it and

263
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,240
out of their curiosity they get in the

264
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,200
trap

265
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,959
so for example there would be a

266
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,959
lucrative server they thought would be

267
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,399
lucrative and

268
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,959
while they are

269
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,040
getting there

270
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,519
we are winning time

271
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,760
so

272
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,839
we

273
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,640
can

274
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,480
see

275
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,360
where they are and how they move

276
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,079
across our infrastructure so we may

277
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,040
track down our actions so we understand

278
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,399
how to combat that and

279
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,040
while he is

280
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,079
in our web we will be winning some time

281
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,680
deception is not suitable for everybody

282
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,519
so if you have a flat

283
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,600
network if nobody knows about road

284
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,480
policy implementation of the deception

285
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,640
may be a little bit too early

286
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,440
but

287
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,720
you may as well tackle that and tackle

288
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,360
security if you can catch

289
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,120
external

290
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,519
violators with deception why not catch

291
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,760
an internal deceptor

292
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,880
internal

293
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,880
violator

294
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,079
for

295
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,519
our inner personnel the violators

296
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,720
who can

297
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,760
download customers data and share them

298
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,040
illicitly

299
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,360
so we understand that there is a mole in

300
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,920
our company so there will be

301
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,200
a great

302
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,959
disadvantage

303
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,359
and this may be not realistic

304
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,959
this person may take a very important

305
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,800
information

306
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,079
they may take

307
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,120
something

308
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,760
virtual like i was showing in the yandex

309
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,880
slide

310
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,760
the orders

311
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,519
of lenion so the dlp problem is about

312
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,200
that we

313
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,839
react to this

314
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,959
delay and

315
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,720
we take

316
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,519
that the data has been taken away

317
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,480
and if we take a look at it a little bit

318
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,920
earlier we can prevent it

319
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,839
so let's just make

320
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,959
conclusions uh we have an insider

321
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,000
threat

322
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,600
which is a fact

323
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,200
and the legislation

324
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,120
does not

325
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,360
does not make us eradicate that it's

326
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,560
easier just to pay a fine 100 000 rather

327
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,200
than spend millions in protection

328
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,240
and the investigation is a very long

329
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,440
process

330
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,399
if we get this process automated a lot

331
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,440
of people will breathe much more easily

332
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,120
they will understand i mean the people

333
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,880
and the security

334
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,160
how to work and which templates to use

335
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,120
and one final thing that

336
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,480
the

337
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,360
traps with the deception technology

338
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,240
help us identify violators inside the

339
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,959
company and protect our data and prevent

340
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,959
the data from stealing thank you very

341
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,959
much

342
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,319
i can see you have questions

343
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,920
thank you very much for your

344
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,920
presentation very interesting i have two

345
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,399
questions uh first of all what's the

346
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,079
principle used by which the data goes to

347
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,680
the trap and maybe you just put

348
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,680
something too attractive in the trap as

349
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,440
an attraction

350
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,959
uh super mega know how as i call it

351
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,279
how to select this data for

352
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,839
a bite

353
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,800
properly

354
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,600
an interesting question thank you very

355
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,720
much

356
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,519
yes

357
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,399
most of the people can

358
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,440
get provoked but

359
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,279
then you realize that the person didn't

360
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,680
really want to do anything bad most of

361
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,160
the people would take this data but they

362
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,279
don't really want to

363
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,880
put

364
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,639
the data to danger

365
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,040
maybe they will not even want to

366
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,240
use it you may want just to highlight

367
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,639
this thread and

368
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,399
afterwards we just need to

369
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,040
verify that this person has been caught

370
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,480
red-handed

371
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,760
and by his reactions you can understand

372
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,000
the potentially that this person wanted

373
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,639
to take everything

374
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,800
it's just two questions right okay and

375
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,680
you answered the second question as well

376
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,360
thank you xenia thank you very much for

377
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,040
your presentation and i have a question

378
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,720
about the

379
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,320
internal

380
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,759
violator who had already left

381
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,000
the company they signed an nda

382
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,000
but this person who left the company in

383
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,120
his

384
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,680
resume in his cv says that i had been

385
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,240
implementing such and such things in the

386
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,480
company so what are going to do about it

387
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,720
yes i was actually thinking

388
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,440
a

389
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,639
simple example when i was at school one

390
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,959
one of the

391
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,160
teachers

392
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,800
was an expert

393
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,240
in

394
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,800
the government exams

395
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,759
and

396
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,880
she had all of the knowledge in the head

397
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,079
not on paper she would just memorize all

398
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,480
this knowledge to instruct us for the

399
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,519
government exams it's kind of difficult

400
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,320
to

401
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,720
eradicate such things you cannot

402
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,720
actually make people

403
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,199
not memorize this if they

404
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,600
study ndas they may memorize some parts

405
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,040
and the second question which is a

406
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,440
little bit more ethical it's the same

407
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,839
nda you just sign an agreement between

408
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,120
companies

409
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,839
that

410
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,040
there is data transmission through

411
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,120
certain means and this company the

412
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,680
integrator is sending the data

413
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,519
how can we

414
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,600
resolve this and how much time do you

415
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,240
think it will take to change the ethics

416
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:54,959
of

417
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,839
people about not disclosing certain

418
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,399
data

419
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,039
about non-disclosure of nda yesterday

420
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,000
there was a presentation in the

421
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,599
safe development section and

422
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,520
they say people have no nda in russia

423
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,679
and you may disclose whatever you like

424
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,160
nobody will punish you for that

425
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,240
jokes aside there's a bit of truth in it

426
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,720
i think

427
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,280
it's true and people and security are

428
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,480
turning into witches with brooms hey

429
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,320
we're going to punish you but in actual

430
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,559
fact they're not going to do anything

431
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,360
so it's just like some person stole some

432
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,679
information shared it with others

433
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,960
and he was just briefly reprimanded and

434
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,360
that's it so if there are no

435
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,640
punishment uh punishment cases people

436
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,480
will not actually treat

437
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,960
that aspect seriously i have a few

438
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,559
questions i would like to thank you for

439
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,039
your presentation eighty percent uh is

440
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,039
uh taken away by

441
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,919
the employees but eighty percent

442
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,880
of people all together but maybe there

443
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,039
are some random

444
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,679
uh ones but there are someone who gets

445
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,520
paid for that somebody pays him a

446
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,880
hundred dollars and they

447
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,520
disclose this information

448
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,440
they have been tipped and greased for

449
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,720
that

450
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,559
yes it's interesting

451
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,600
to understand their motives and drives

452
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
what drives people do that but i

453
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,440
actually heard a very interesting

454
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,240
question in one of the conferences so if

455
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,799
a person

456
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,320
joined the company what are you going to

457
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,280
do

458
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,240
for a certain amount of money so

459
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,840
somebody said

460
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,000
no we're not going to do that

461
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,640
but some people asked how much are they

462
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,760
going to offer us

463
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,760
so

464
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,120
this person

465
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,039
created a threat

466
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,240
and you fire a person who actually know

467
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,240
how knows how to expose

468
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,600
the system of yours will this pose a

469
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,840
threat

470
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,360
so

471
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,880
if we

472
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,520
are going to

473
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,919
point it out

474
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,440
there will be

475
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,440
a rare example of

476
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,679
firing

477
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,919
this 60 000

478
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,240
fine

479
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,600
is there

480
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,080
increase of a fine are you considering

481
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,200
increasing the fine after all these uh

482
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,039
story

483
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,039
we thought that it would be just limited

484
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,600
with sixty thousand but no it's not

485
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,200
there was a

486
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,520
criminal criminal

487
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,320
punishment initiated

488
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,440
and

489
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,919
a court case started so i think it's

490
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,600
going to get aggravated and the

491
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,399
situation will improve

492
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,880
so you can google

493
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,840
you can google it um

494
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,480
they cannot

495
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,840
know anything about

496
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,039
zberbank and

497
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,000
later there was a

498
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,919
message written to

499
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,919
german graph about

500
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,320
stealing that data

501
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,520
so it was 25 million

502
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,480
rubles the amount that this person

503
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,679
owes to burbank and he's still in prison

504
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,120
so i guess

505
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,360
this person

506
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,000
poses some danger

507
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,720
and

508
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,640
60 000 that's for yandex

509
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,159
but those

510
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,400
who

511
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,600
would like to violate something really

512
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,679
is going to pay 60 million it's much

513
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,320
more it's a sizable amount

514
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,960
something like that

515
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,600
so it very much depends on the company

516
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,679
so if it's a serious uh

517
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,760
company

518
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,039
it will

519
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,600
demand and if you cannot stipulate uh

520
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,760
what this person

521
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,559
knows i was doing that

522
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,600
and that damaged you

523
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,918
you can

524
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,080
hire

525
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,039
a legal expert uh even a student

526
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,840
who can cope with that

527
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,039
thank you

528
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,480
very interesting presentation but we're

529
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,679
talking about

530
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,440
morale and

531
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,840
it's very important in development of

532
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,440
the software especially when we talk

533
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,559
about

534
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,760
security so there's a question about

535
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,400
deception

536
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,720
maybe we create

537
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,679
this

538
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,520
temptation for an employee

539
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,760
to use

540
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,640
the information

541
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,440
maybe it looks like a provocation so

542
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,480
people

543
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,480
do not prohibit to commit

544
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,440
this

545
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,600
why it's not

546
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,080
restricted for commercial organizations

547
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,280
maybe it's

548
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,120
the wrong way

549
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,880
[Music]

550
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,720
so previously there was a presentation

551
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,480
which was related to sending

552
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,960
letters to the individuals so that

553
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,039
we can understand how they react to

554
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,240
fishing how can we not train individuals

555
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,600
as well so it's true if we consider some

556
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,159
fission attempts if you you get such

557
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,679
message

558
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,000
a lot of people would say okay how come

559
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,220
there's no fishing and

560
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,440
[Music]

561
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,960
you're sending

562
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,760
this to us

563
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,799
so

564
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,799
this country

565
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,000
i mean

566
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,559
we have an option to choose

567
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,960
so maybe it looks not

568
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,440
like training it's just looks like the

569
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,480
training of a dog

570
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,960
with treats so that you train the dog

571
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,240
not to eat the treats

572
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,400
partially yes

573
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,840
partially yes

574
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,600
well there may be some

575
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,320
good uh hint about fire drills you

576
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,320
mentioned fire drills we have fire

577
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,840
drills

578
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,240
um so it may may be arranged in a

579
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,679
similar way

580
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,520
so you get cold out of work you get

581
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,080
called out into the street uh during the

582
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,880
course of a fire drill looks strange

583
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,760
you could have worked and then they

584
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,720
start demonstrating the first aid on a

585
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,559
mannequin

586
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,320
on a dummy

587
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,760
looks strange but necessary so sometimes

588
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,080
you need to select you need to choose

589
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,919
what you would like to do so you would

590
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,840
like to teach a person

591
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,640
to do something using your mistake or

592
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,960
maybe

593
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,559
this kind of training is very important

594
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,120
although sometimes it looks like a waste

595
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,840
of time

596
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,440
yes thank you very much
