1
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,080
cyber security and creative thinking

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,559
what is in common cyber security is

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,519
hardcore guys who are writing code

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,200
behind the computer

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,759
creative guys are guys who are poets

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,640
write poetry artworks pictures and it's

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,640
a totally different world

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,880
but right now we're going to speak about

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,519
how these worlds are compatible

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,359
together with vladimir kuchakov the head

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,880
of the department of the research and

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,359
development

13
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,320
director of positive technologies who is

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,879
online with us hello

15
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,120

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,800
things on one side you're writing code

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,480
you are developer of product on the

19
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,720
other side as i know

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,640
you're an artist

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,920
you love gaming and you're involved also

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,880
in

23
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,280
investigation of human capabilities

24
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,720
capabilities of human brain

25
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:17,759
you

26
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,640
are professional dancer

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,080
you are a poet at the same time

28
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,320
somehow you came into cyber security

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,040
genia has been creating

30
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,280
big events like positive hog days and no

31
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,640
more than that

32
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,640
nothing bigger than that

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,079
it's big enough but you was creating big

34
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,840
events

35
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,240
you feel movies and you started by

36
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,560
participating in kvns

37
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,799
the club of happy and smart

38
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,640
okay

39
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,200
let's speak how can you combine all

40
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,200
those things within yourself you have a

41
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,360
privilege you are remote let's begin

42
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,679
with you

43
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,399
first of all i would like to say it's

44
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,000
too sad that i'm not located here

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
because i receive a lot of videos and i

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,520
see how and what is happening here

47
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,239
it's too sad that i wasn't able to fly

48
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,400
second thing i would like to say hi

49
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,200
to

50
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,840
my design and creativeness department

51
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,160
big guys good guys you did a great job

52
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,400
and you did everything great and number

53
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,160
three what is the question please

54
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,280
[Music]

55
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,480
how are you able to combine cyber

56
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,319
security

57
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,879
and these fun stuff films events and all

58
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,560
this creative stuff which happens with

59
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,680
your head how does it work together

60
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,160
well this is a story that you are

61
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,879
growing together with yourself depending

62
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,200
from well you're stepping over some

63
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,120
small steps from the creativeness point

64
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,280
of view then these objectives you bring

65
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,280
to automatism and you come to the next

66
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,760
level and as for the cyber security you

67
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,360
looks like you have reached the top

68
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,800
level the boss

69
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,560
which has a lot of quests and you like

70
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,519
guessing them working them you like to

71
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,840
work on those challenges which

72
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,920
previously were not understandable by

73
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,200
you

74
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,760
and in addition to that because

75
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,760
right now cyber security is

76
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,040
number one story which is mentioned in

77
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,400
our country

78
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,640
i think that close attention

79
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,519
is paid to this topic so right now it

80
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,239
happens that

81
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,760
projects become more and more

82
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,080
complicated more and more interesting

83
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,360
and it becomes uh a big quest to

84
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,920
popularize them and because of this you

85
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,959
just again gain some experience and you

86
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,560
are moving forward

87
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,840
something like that that's how i think

88
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,760
but the result is beautiful a lot of

89
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,040
beauty

90
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,560
yesterday there was a presentation for

91
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,360
investors and

92
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,439
everybody said it was beautiful it was

93
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,560
really beautiful yeah you see you see

94
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,640
a lot of different objectives you have

95
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,600
community which needs information on the

96
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,199
other side you have investors on the

97
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,440
third side you have

98
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,240
regular people and all this together

99
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,560
it's a big mix of people it's super

100
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,639
interesting guys

101
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,080
those of you who is looking for

102
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,360
interesting that's very cool thank you

103
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,160
from dance to cyber security how did it

104
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,520
happen

105
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,960
you know vladimir the first thing that

106
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,199
comes to my mind is a quote from the

107
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,840
movie legend of the autumn with brad

108
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,440
pitt and anthony hobbs in the beginning

109
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,919
they said that there are people who hear

110
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,600
a certain call inside of themselves some

111
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,000
of them become crazy and some become

112
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,280
legends

113
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,759
so that's what happened that i'm really

114
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,960
involved person

115
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,680
and to me the world is absolutely

116
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,840
beautiful place

117
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,160
so

118
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,600
[Music]

119
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,800
we've been speaking about it with

120
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,600
vladimir about abstractions and that

121
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,000
abstract model of world perception it's

122
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,120
a model which is uh done by a human

123
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,759
being and every beginning every start

124
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,680
every creative component and any

125
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,360
creativity is a certain level of

126
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,639
obstruction which person can feel

127
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,039
and try to prove it and materialize it

128
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,680
in reality of course dance poetry

129
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,520
writing copywriting everything that

130
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,280
happens in cyber security everything

131
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,840
that happens in our company it's crazy

132
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,960
interest

133
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,039
which allows me to materialize myself

134
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,520
from different sites and

135
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,000
add to each other and combine each other

136
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,400
with the development of the product

137
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,759
how is it important to get outside of

138
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,880
the borders of traditional way of

139
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,319
thinking

140
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,360
and which role is played by your

141
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,039
creative skills that you

142
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,120
produce well i should divide product

143
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,400
development into two parallel fields

144
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,280
development and research

145
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,039
where we already have certain

146
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,720
developments on production the code has

147
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,800
been written and developed the one

148
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,479
that's going to go to release and will

149
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,520
go to the clients the creativity doesn't

150
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,759
have a lot of space because it's well

151
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,759
known what are we writing how should we

152
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,400
write it we need to follow the quality

153
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,199
and they don't really welcome

154
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,600
movement in a direction to the left to

155
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,000
the right because as a rule it is done

156
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,759
by the team and the code which is

157
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,639
written by the team should equally be

158
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,880
understood by all the team members if a

159
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,520
person will start self-expressing to the

160
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,680
court well it is possible to be done

161
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,599
even though it sounds very strangely but

162
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,120
it is realistic but other people will

163
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,599
not perceive this code as good as if it

164
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,440
was written according to certain

165
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,080
commonly accepted standard standards and

166
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,479
rules also for algorithmic decisions

167
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,319
everything which is under development

168
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,000
but before prior to its development

169
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,240
stage there is a research stage it

170
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,160
happens in parallel but still it's a

171
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,360
separate stage and on this stage the

172
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,400
less rules are going to be applied for

173
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,840
the engineer who is trying to solve

174
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,400
certain objective uh the better and

175
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
simpler it's going to be for him to find

176
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,880
a solution and i have a fear sometimes a

177
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,360
small phobia which is related with

178
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
development i'm afraid that even my

179
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,599
managers uh will learn how often i make

180
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,280
decisions intuitively because they will

181
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,440
not like these uh statistics because it

182
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,280
doesn't happen once

183
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,599
right now for example in a positive

184
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,639
application inspector we are replacing

185
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,199
all analysis modules by the common core

186
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,680
with the common code base which has been

187
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,520
created in an interesting way about four

188
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,919
years ago together with our colleague

189
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,840
ramy mullis and we've been communicating

190
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,680
with him

191
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,120
it right that

192
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,720
you have decided to make javascript

193
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,199
analyzer yeah i said yes we're making it

194
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,599
and uh aren't you afraid that you will

195
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,199
break your career on this because

196
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,319
javascript analyzes that analyzer is a

197
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,160
very complicated thing due to

198
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,840
communication this language i say oh my

199
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,360
god i don't know maybe i can break it

200
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,680
but i had a certain doubt in my head and

201
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,080
then i was sitting and thinking yes the

202
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,560
logic tells me i shouldn't do this we

203
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,560
could say no to this objective we

204
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,879
shouldn't do it it's very complicated

205
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,360
it's very cumbersome it will have a lot

206
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,440
of problems dozens of problems

207
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,440
immediately i could see uh what we're

208
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,200
going to face but inside of me something

209
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,719
told me we have to do it we have to do

210
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,360
it try it and it was the longest

211
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,360
development that we have done in the

212
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,320
model of analysis but right now all pt

213
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,680
application inspector moves to this

214
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,399
model it works much faster it gives more

215
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,640
precision of results and finally thanks

216
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,760
to this module we could give

217
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,880
comfortable uh answers to wde uh

218
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,279
producers because my guys were

219
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,519
uh charged with this enthusiasm and on

220
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,640
the pure intuition we've been

221
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,839
continuously moving blindly finding

222
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,519
approaches and finding optimal

223
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,360
approaches and we've been in less

224
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,200
engineers and more creators

225
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,959
well guys can you tell me please about

226
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,800
your non-standard discoveries which

227
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,040
have influenced your work

228
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,279
it is a very complicated question

229
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,040
no it's not a secret from you nobody

230
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,120
will give up their own secrets yes we

231
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,800
have discovered them but

232
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,000
well this story that every morning you

233
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,120
take bath with watermelons is that true

234
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,640
we have agreed that this will stay

235
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,399
between us well thank you very much for

236
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,480
telling this to everyone

237
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,560
but well i can tell you one thing from

238
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,040
myself perhaps

239
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,719
as a recommendation to people

240
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,399
work who um

241
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,920
their way in creativity i want to

242
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,760
continue it a great number of watching

243
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,200
you have to watch a lot of things

244
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,120
because our brain

245
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,680
tries to make examples in the childhood

246
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,160
you remember they ask you how much two

247
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,399
plus two you save five because you

248
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,320
forgot to say think again but you don't

249
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,240
think you just remember options in

250
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,000
creativity same thing the more

251
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,959
information you digest the more results

252
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,200
you will give out at a certain amount of

253
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,959
moment of time and will compile it in a

254
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,680
non-standard way so the more examples

255
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,240
and variants you have in your head the

256
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,720
more options you will provide the more

257
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,480
interesting will be your solutions in

258
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,600
other words that's why someday

259
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,920
the artificial intelligence

260
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,120
will make humans

261
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,800
to shake will make us shake

262
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,360
it's interesting ending

263
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,440
but it's an interesting thesis are

264
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,440
challenging to vote for kuchetkov

265
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,360
artificial intelligence will make us

266
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,240
shake

267
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,279
okay let's speak about it volva

268
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,440
what your creative thinking is bringing

269
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,600
you to especially when you think about

270
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,880
it okay

271
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,120
thinking about some live hugs and i you

272
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,880
know i remember just too and i can share

273
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,360
them with you principal well this is not

274
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,279
something related with watermelons

275
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,720
why do i want to share this with you

276
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,120
it's from the artwork i brought it to my

277
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,320
workplace uh art artists they have a

278
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,399
problem of uh blank page when he has a

279
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,480
blank page he doesn't know how to start

280
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,760
his artwork it's like procrastination in

281
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,680
the office that's how it has been called

282
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,320
artists call it like that

283
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,839
you just take the

284
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,240
pencil and make some curve but this

285
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,720
curve should be dynamic nice not just a

286
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,800
straight line and then from this little

287
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,360
curve you start making your work and

288
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,000
this works magically on the artist as

289
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,639
soon as you have a certain curve on your

290
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,880
blank page you try to improve it

291
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,560
continuously and you continuously

292
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,079
improving it make it better better

293
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,600
better and then you look different then

294
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,040
the creative process is moving

295
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,680
differently i work with a programming

296
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,120
code differently i write something

297
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,240
stupid just to make it and compile it's

298
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,800
something and i call the method i said

299
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,720
that you need to analyze javascript code

300
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,040
like that then well you need to unlock

301
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,959
javascript code well this function will

302
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,360
be divided if we have to pass code we

303
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,279
have to build a model we have these well

304
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,839
i have three methods and then i start

305
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,600
dividing dividing dividing i start

306
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,839
building rounded common functionality

307
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,880
and then architecture becomes like that

308
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,240
very often it's been changed

309
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,560
but it helps me to begin

310
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,720
thinking in this direction and the

311
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,120
second life well i forgot about the

312
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,079
second one while i've been speaking

313
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,519
about the first one but how can you give

314
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,720
me the comment about artificial

315
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,880
intelligence

316
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,360
this is your topic

317
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,120
well uh

318
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,279
this is my topic out of three of us well

319
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,120
you have to understand that artificial

320
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,240
intelligence right now uh becomes more

321
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,720
and more powerful however on level of

322
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,440
mathematics there is no confidence that

323
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,440
human brain works as we think it works

324
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,360
because things that we do in the area of

325
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,360
artificial intelligence we just do the

326
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,120
same thing that happens in the heads of

327
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,279
pe people because there's a mass of

328
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,959
bright theories from well-known

329
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,160
physicists like roger penrose who

330
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,279
assumed that between neurons in addition

331
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,440
to electromagnetic communication are

332
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,480
quantum

333
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,040
relations

334
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,360
well this hypothesis is not against

335
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,000
anything that is available in physics

336
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,680
and if this will be

337
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,360
truthful there will be so many

338
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,040
consequences

339
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,600
that our ai is not intellect compared to

340
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,440
this and second of all due to the

341
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,880
quantum uh bending it might happen that

342
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,880
human thinking is connected with each

343
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,120
other

344
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,320
the quantum connection

345
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,240
and you can fantasize a lot about it

346
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,639
you can think about anything but this is

347
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,199
too far away and

348
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,120
there is no possibility to check these

349
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,839
uh

350
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,240
hypotheses of this quantum entanglement

351
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,600
in the brain but as uh for the

352
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,440
artificial intelligence there's nothing

353
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,519
to compare it with we don't know how our

354
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,600
intellect works where it comes from and

355
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,519
why mathematically it is impossible to

356
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,399
prove uh any free theorem you take any

357
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,320
free theorem and there is no algorithm

358
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,320
following which you will prove it but

359
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,199
they do prove theorems uh somehow they

360
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,279
do it somehow they prove it not

361
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,600
algorithmically because people have

362
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,079
proven that they've done it this way but

363
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,360
how it's not understandable

364
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,040
and this question can be looked from the

365
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,680
point of view as how the person

366
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,279
will analyze the work of the artificial

367
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,760
intelligence whether the person will

368
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,480
perceive the ai together with living

369
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,680
authors

370
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,440
and as for me

371
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,440
because i write i have two assumptions

372
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,519
if we speak about uh some simple content

373
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,040
with some simple forms like articles or

374
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,399
some popular books

375
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,959
some algorithmization can be found there

376
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,560
but if we're going to speak about

377
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,639
artificial intelligence that will

378
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,800
transfer some subjective experience

379
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,959
built on some obstructions

380
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,638
some dostoyevsky or

381
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,320
lassen tree uh has been expressing

382
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,079
something well this is under big

383
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,519
question mark

384
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,279
to create some algorithm when the text

385
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,759
will be perceived by human

386
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,759
uh on the same line with artificial

387
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,920
intelligence as possible but some are

388
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,440
key art pieces with human loyalty i

389
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,759
don't know

390
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,040
maybe something that was created by

391
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,480
artificial intelligence would be based

392
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,160
on something that already was done by

393
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,440
humans

394
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,440
because this will be some learning

395
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,240
machine learning uh to which ai went

396
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,320
through the ex existing experience but

397
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,720
not something principal in you

398
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,320
well i wanted to support you

399
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,639
because it's going to be expressed

400
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,120
everywhere yes in literature

401
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,279
non-standard solutions are not really

402
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,959
applicable but in music

403
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,800
there are full albums which you can find

404
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,399
on music platforms

405
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,320
where the system of the heat has been

406
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,680
studying and there's an album which

407
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,880
consists of the pieces by artificial

408
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,360
intelligence and it's like you're

409
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,000
listening it like to a real music some

410
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,240
light cool music which plays in the

411
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,079
background in your ears and you don't

412
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,920
understand that it was written

413
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,759
by humans

414
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,279
and you don't understand that it's a

415
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,920
sample that was kind of different

416
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,079
as a harmony as for the

417
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,560
uh creative art

418
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,800
like a team in levels of studio

419
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,680
they have

420
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,240
a neural project

421
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,599
which generates logos

422
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,319
so as i think

423
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,039
this will be reborn well some part of

424
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:19,079
creative industry will stop

425
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,440
is

426
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,749
