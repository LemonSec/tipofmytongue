[Music]

2
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,558
anyway

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,439
we are still at phd

4
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,320
it's a hacker's forum we are discussing

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,160
information security and we also um me

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,238
here investigate deep fakes

7
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,800
um you saw one defect behind me vladimir

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,399
yes could not leave the stage on time uh

9
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,399
and he stayed here for a while let's do

10
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,399
fake okay welcome back

11
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,680
we are going to

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,840
discuss something very interesting right

13
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,760
now we're going to talk about the youth

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,160
we're going to talk about the mass and

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,320
we'll talk about

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,000
cryptography and we are also going to

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,359
talk about a museum how all i mean these

18
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,000
different words that together

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,879
uh

20
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,360
you will find out very soon please

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,680
welcome uh

22
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,479
ceo at kryptonite

23
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,840
right what is kryptonite

24
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,560
and the museum of cryptography

25
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,000
what association do you have with it

26
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,520
we are a

27
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,520
research and production company

28
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,000
we do scientific research

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,520
in cryptography and we also develop

30
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,799
products

31
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,840
that are related to cryptography and to

32
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,240
big data

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,119
on

34
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,119
employing many

35
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,840
scientists many researchers

36
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,840
academics because we will also want to

37
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,560
develop the academic side of it in the

38
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,560
cryptography market

39
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,000
we are one of the best supplies in terms

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,360
of academic expertise

41
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,038
do you think that the younger generation

42
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,200
today is uh actually enthusiastic about

43
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,680
crypto something well crypto something

44
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,280
yes it's very popular you mean

45
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,400
cryptocurrencies of course

46
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,640
and

47
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,840
here where the

48
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,959
museum makes the stage

49
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,160
we

50
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,480
must bring back

51
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,440
uh

52
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,040
well rather we must

53
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,040
make signs fashionable again we must

54
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,879
explain to children that

55
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,440
science is not something boring and it's

56
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,040
not just algebra lessons in school but

57
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,720
it's exciting it's interesting

58
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,519
everything that they see around them is

59
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,440
based on algebra that they study at

60
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,400
school

61
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,720
and i think that this well

62
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,599
after a while it will

63
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,720
make

64
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,519
some of these children into good

65
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,200
scientists some of them will want to

66
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,680
become mathematicians for instance

67
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,920
and yes there are

68
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,720
kids who participate already

69
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,159
in

70
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,440
various

71
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,680
uh

72
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,400
cryptography

73
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,120
games and competitions and math studios

74
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,239
but the movement is still not very

75
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,319
massive

76
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,599
okay i don't want to argue but in my

77
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,760
world view when i was a young kid

78
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,879
i knew my country to be the best read in

79
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,000
the world but now as i am

80
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,879
following the news

81
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,000
very often i get to hear

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,959
that the country is very strong in

83
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,840
physics and math and russian coders are

84
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,959
the best coders ever

85
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,040
i mean the parents the parents are known

86
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,120
to be good mathematicians but not kids

87
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,799
why not kids

88
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,720
well i'm not sure about the first

89
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,959
statement that you made

90
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,720
yes later i would argue with that as

91
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,519
well

92
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,120
but even if it were the case

93
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,400
these are the people who grew up i mean

94
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,160
if you

95
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,600
look at

96
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,440
the teenagers

97
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,000
the 12 year olds 13 year olds

98
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,799
their interests

99
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,360
[Music]

100
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,400
they do not always extend to the

101
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,840
scientific

102
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,520
foundations of what

103
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,199
surrounds them they are more interested

104
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,280
in tick-tock formats

105
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,199
clips

106
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,360
small formats so yes it's a way to

107
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,919
engage them but our objective is

108
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,840
to eventually

109
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,720
get a good scientist a good engineer and

110
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,320
to become a good engineer you need to

111
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,039
study a lot and

112
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,560
you wouldn't be able to become good

113
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,120
engineers through clips um people need

114
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,600
to to understand that uh

115
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,280
technology is complex and complicated

116
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,440
you have to study it

117
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,280
we have always been strong in the soviet

118
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,240
union with the fund or you know school

119
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,360
schooling

120
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,240
so first a person would be trained as a

121
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,440
mathematician uh and later will be

122
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,120
trained to be

123
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,280
a programmer because they had this

124
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,199
excellent education and algorithms that

125
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,840
would become good programmers but now

126
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,000
what we are looking is this fundamental

127
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
initial training today things are

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,520
changing understand and probably we

129
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,560
don't need that many uh programmers with

130
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,960
excel and fundamental education but also

131
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,880
because of the quality of fundamental

132
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,000
training also suffers

133
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,479
what you are saying i think is rather

134
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,759
critical

135
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,039
um

136
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,800
what i hear you say

137
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,639
is

138
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,960
our

139
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,520
how to

140
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,240
perceive the world in a complex

141
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,240
way in a complex manner they can

142
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,400
perceive the world through clips but not

143
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,800
in anything more complex than that

144
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,039
well what we try to do what and by the

145
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,759
way yeah at the museum

146
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,639
we are trying to explain complex things

147
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,120
in a simple way

148
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,280
and it's something that that took most

149
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,240
of our time we actually assembled a lot

150
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,599
of professional

151
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,319
uh scientists so that together they

152
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,240
would be able to explain to us a 10 year

153
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,080
old how electronic signature works and

154
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,360
it's not easy

155
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,520
and it's not easy it's you have to be

156
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,120
stay true to the mathematical

157
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,360
background of it you can explain it in

158
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,400
an easy way but it can't uh demonstrate

159
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,560
it in an easy way and the components

160
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,880
that we are displaying they are intended

161
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,319
for the

162
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,360
people who have little knowledge or who

163
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,199
have this uh habit of clip thinking

164
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,560
to keep them interested

165
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,240
that explanation can be used as a basis

166
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,039
for another explanation you can tell uh

167
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,240
the viewer that that's the part of math

168
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,759
that uh

169
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,000
that that actually is the theory for

170
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,240
what you saw and you can go beyond two

171
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,520
plus two equals four you can uh uh

172
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,520
go deeper you can let kids play with the

173
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,360
with the basics first and then get them

174
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,599
interested and after that you can teach

175
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,560
them uh in more profound matters

176
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,240
how old is the museum

177
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,240
we opened it

178
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,560
at the end of last year end of last year

179
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,000
end of last year

180
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,039
okay end of last year

181
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:23,520
i mean

182
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,799
is this a different child now

183
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,760
you can stay there for five hours six

184
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,479
hours eight hours

185
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,800
and the museum is

186
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,680
it presents information different layers

187
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,320
uh uh every installation has a lot of

188
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,120
information so often people or kids come

189
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,110
back to continue their visit

190
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,399
[Music]

191
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,839
they want to press all the buttons

192
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,519
eventually

193
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,399
but once they are in we are also offer

194
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,279
educational programs we want to keep the

195
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,360
kids inside this educational environment

196
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,120
and we also add installations and we

197
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,160
also fix errors

198
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
can you say something about the

199
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,040
installation about the displays

200
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,200
two dimensions we are a classical museum

201
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,600
that is to say we display a lot of

202
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,080
classical equipment special encryption

203
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,839
devices and uh stuff

204
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,839
we've got enigma we've got uh

205
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,160
the violet we we have a lot of pieces of

206
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,680
equipment and we explained how this

207
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,240
equipment works and in addition to the

208
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,240
actual devices

209
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,360
we also explained the math we explained

210
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,240
why this device works the way it does

211
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,399
how it's built internally

212
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,200
what are the fundamental factors that

213
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,320
enable its existence so uh basically you

214
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,320
can come there as a viewer or piece of

215
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,160
equipment and you can also come there as

216
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,360
a more profound viewer who wants to go

217
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,120
deeper into details

218
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,160
historically the historical exhibits i

219
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,880
mean we have a lot of

220
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,880
pieces of technology

221
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,800
uh we re-tell the story of those devices

222
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,959
and we also tell stories of people

223
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,279
cryptography in the soviet union was a

224
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,680
closed off sphere and

225
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,640
the names of the people who were

226
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,720
considered to be experts were not very

227
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,200
well known

228
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,880
we bring back their stories there is the

229
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,240
uh

230
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,800
office of ketelnikov for instance

231
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,240
uh that

232
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,200
has

233
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,399
his own things his own belongings in it

234
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,240
so it's an interactive museum but it is

235
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,560
also a very traditional museum wonderful

236
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,079
i have a final question to you

237
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,720
what is the age

238
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,920
of your target audience

239
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,000
and would parents be interested in

240
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,600
visiting your museum as well well first

241
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,519
of all the parents would definitely be

242
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,760
very happy uh to visit the museum

243
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,959
probably the parents would be more

244
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,560
interested in

245
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,000
learning about history i don't know

246
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,360
there are some parents who also like

247
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,839
pressing

248
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,360
buttons has two kids

249
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,720
i'd say

250
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,279
10 11 12

251
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,279
is probably the best age well of course

252
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,399
you can bring kids of any age

253
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,320
but it's best if your kid knows how to

254
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,880
read at least thank you very much

255
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,160
well dear friends if you've got kids

256
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,000
aged 10 up

257
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,320
then please come see varathan's museum

258
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,639
if you do not have kids go and see where

259
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,720
towns museum

260
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,160
if you are under the age of 10 then

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,720
go and talk to your mom and dad and tell

262
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,040
