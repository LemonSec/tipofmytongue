question of technological sovereignty

define the focus

46
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,520
of where to move

47
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,000
to reach that kind of sovereignty so

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,479
that our critically important

49
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,360
infrastructure could operate

50
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,959

51

we all know

52
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,440
so the first question is just a simple

53
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,480
one

54
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,360
a warm-up question

55
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,920
vendors and customers and integrators

56
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,760

did did customer requirements change

61
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,879
what kind of solutions became more

62
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,280
popular what kind of functionality

63
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,800
became more popular and which are less

64
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,920
popular now alexander you are the first

65
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,840
thank you

hello everyone

67
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,959
talking about the changes

68
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,560
uh there are two trends the first one is

69
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,560
that

70
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,040
lack of foreign vendors

71
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,560
foreign

72
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,280
vendors leaving us

73
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,319
and as a result the customers start

74
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,280
relying on us talking to us

75
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,560
on questions of antivirus protection

76
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,080
because kaspersky didn't occupy 100

77
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,440
percent of the rush of our market

78

security area

81
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,239
and our products are relatively new

82
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,519
foreign vendors

83
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,799
didn't uh occupy the large share in

84
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,560
those areas

85
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,200
one of the global trend

86
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,840
trends is

87
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,599
like this

88
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,840
urgent

89
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,560
replacement

90
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,040
of technologies that are not supported

91
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,400
and the second trend

92
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,480
it has occurred

93
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,400
and we can work on any hardware basis

94
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,560
but the customers have

95
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,759
problems

96
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,639
with

97
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,520
increasing the computing power

98
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,040
and

99
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,400
some projects are delayed because they

100
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,040
need computing facilities

101
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,240

104

thank you alexander yes the question of

105
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,759
hardware

106
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,759
is

107
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,199
urgent

108
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,000
one of the most urgent

109
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,479
in the area of digital independence

110
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,759
a lot of large-scale contracts

111
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,400
were stopped here

112
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,520
and it's an important thing really

113
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,560
and i have one more question

114
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,639
the problem with hardware delivery could

115
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,320
have been

116
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,199
solved by developing our own local

117

are very

122
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,600
high-tech technologies we need

123
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,639
manufacturing facilities of a certain

124
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,600
kind and right now because of the

international situation

126
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,800

131
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,000
of palladium was delivered by russia but

132
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,440
more than 50 percent

possibility of buying locally produced

good morning dear colleagues it's

147
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,000

micro electronic basis

158
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,720
but i would like to give you an example

159
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,880
which startled us

160
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,520
and disappointed us

161
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,000
as many other software vendors we use

162
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,039

164
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,919
from delivered from taiwan taiwan

165
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,080
supported sanctions and we started

166
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,080
looking at china

167
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,599

as a result cannot

help us at the end of february they

171
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,400
stopped accepting our orders

172
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,120
their lawyers uh are not yet sure how to

173
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,240
deal with us how to continue deliveries

174
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,280

178
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,080
interact with different companies but we

179
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,799
don't see any breakthrough we don't see

00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,440
any silver bullet now

181
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,399
so we have to deal with that problem on

182
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,799
and on

183
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,399
to specify

184
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,200
the problems with chinese components

185
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,360
where are they are they

186
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,720
legal

187
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,760
or are they

188
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,800
logistical

189
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,600
it's all right with logistics

190
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,279
it's legal in many companies up to 25

191
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,920
shares belong to the u.s partners and

192
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,720
those u.s partners uh

193
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,279
exert their influence on the chinese

194
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,399
company

195
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,440
and they forced them to join sanctions

196
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,279
there are no technical problems there

197
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,760
are no logistical problems the problem

198
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,399
is sanctions

199
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,600
i see thank you very much

200
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,959
of course

201
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,680
sanctions

202
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,880
also accelerated our import

203
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,959
substitutions of course we have been

204
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,519
thinking about import substitution and

205
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,519
independence now we just

206
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,480
have to do it and fast have to do it

207
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,839
fast so the situation is gradually

208
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,040
improving

209
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,000
at the end of february all the channels

210
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,760
were closed but

211
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,839
a bit

212
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,440
later the partners

213
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,560
our

214
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,399
continuous

215
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,120
customers

216
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,160
well started finding other ways longer

217
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,200
ways

218
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,959
to continue

219
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,599
deliveries

220
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,040
so let's talk about something really

221
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,880
positive

222
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,519
uh the problems are acute

223
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,760
and the next question is to sergei

224
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,160
i have an impression

225
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,959
that

226
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,240
functionally

227
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,760
our own locally produced products

228
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,959
are not worse than their foreign

229
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,160
equivalents in some vendors

230
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,680
have even better

231
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,959
products than the foreigners and they

232
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,600
their products were sold internationally

233
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,880
and some of the products were

234
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,800
in top ten

235
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,399
products

236
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,399
in their industries what about

237
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,040
the companies who work with different

238
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,839
vendors

239
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,279
uh are our cybersecurity products better

240
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,040
or worse than

241
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,839
the foreign ones

242
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,680
well i would

243
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,959
join your opinion because

244
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,480
if we take the

245
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,120
all the products the basic products

246
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,560
everything

247
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,760
that

248
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,519
was

249
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,640
based on imported technologies

250
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,399
can be

251
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,079
implemented on top of local products and

252
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,000
the local products

253
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,240
uh are good enough

254
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,040
and they are actively developing

255
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,880
now they use

256
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,079
advanced technologies that we didn't

257
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,000
have six months ago

258
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,880
and in general i would say that

259
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,600
the local market got a good impetus for

260
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,680
development

261
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,880
we see a lot of foreign solutions

262
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,839
that can be replaced

263
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,399
substituted with

264
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,160
russian analogues of course there are

265
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,480
some limitations

266
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,720
if for example we use proprietary

267
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,760
technologies cisco for instance

268
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,240
so we

269
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,360
have to change them but

270
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,560
uh

271
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,519
they

272
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,440
would be different so

273
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,639
we would try to develop the products

274
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,839
that

275
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,120
would be

276
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,839
not worse than

277
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,360
cisco of course i have an internal

278
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,079
opinion that from the viewpoint of

279
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,440
specialists

280
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,240
engineers developers

281
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,279
and the production base

282
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,720
of course we could close all the gaps if

283
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,040
we come together and

284
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,519
try to do our best

285
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,040
our

286
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,320
determination and will is what is

287
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,959
needed most of all

288
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,800
so the next question

289
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,560
is as follows

290
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,600
what

291
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,760
do we have to change

292
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,760
in ourselves

293
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,800
what do we have to focus on to reach

294
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,839
technological

295
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,800
independence i believe we have to

296
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,639
replace the attitude to education we

297
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,320
need r d

298
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,880
centers what do you think what do we

299
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,000
what are we missing now

300
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,680
well i would like to

301
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,680
say a few words about the previous

302
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,720
question

303
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,680
yes

304
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,760
in our portfolio more than 80

305
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,360
of solutions

306
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,320
are local

307
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,079
that was a joke

308
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,240
that russian microchips are very mature

309
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,279
and stable and have two handles for

310
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,279
carrying yes functionally we can cope

311
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,560
but sometimes they are bulky they are

312
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,600
not convenient they are not cozy very

313
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,199
often uh that area is

314
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,399
not our best

315
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,160
performance not our best

316
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,000
functionality so

317
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,360
we have to pay attention not only on uh

318
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,320
software functions but on

319
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,240
compactness on

320
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,120
customer

321
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,839
convenience

322
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:48,720
on

323
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,720
usability

324
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,760
import substitution

325
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,560
was activated in 2014

326
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,000
even earlier but convenience coziness

327
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
usability

328
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,000
customer experience that's what we need

329
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,760
in some areas we take the same foreign

330
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,360
product uh put the russian-based uh

331
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,040
shell on top and say this is local

332
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,990
but now we have to change that approach

333
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:29,179
[Music]

334
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,800
as quickly as possible

335
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,240
as cheap as possible

336
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,800
but we have to look deeper

337
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,360
long term

338
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,680
let's be honest

339
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,399
we don't always need 15 nanometer

340
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,320
technologies

341
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,560
sometimes we can use bigger

342
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,040
chips

343
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,560
and we shouldn't

344
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,800
replace western

345
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,359
technologies by eastern technologies

346
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,639
western substitution

347
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,160
should not become

348
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,320
substitution by eastern technologies

349
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,680
so in the next uh 15 to 20 technologies

350
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,440
we cannot reach

351
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,279
the

352
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,320
top level technologies

353
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,839
so we need to find our own way to close

354
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,350
the gaps

355
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:38,460

then the products that we are developing

357
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,639
now

358
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,920
should be

359
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,800
competitive

360
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,680
we have to look long terms we need

361
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,440
competence centers rng centers

362
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,560
free economic zones

363
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,759
joint stock enterprises

364
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,399
full cycle enterprises

365
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,720
so we shouldn't

366
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,599
look at gaps here it's import

367
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,400
substitution here we have to

368
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,599
buy from

369
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,520
some asian company

370
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,000
independence is independence

371
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,319
it should be really independent from the

372
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,039
east and from the west

373
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,160
i can only agree with you

374
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,160
yes

375
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,919
so we have to join efforts

376
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,610
join efforts

377
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,200
[Music]

378
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,640
do you think

379
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,200
we have to join efforts in any way if we

380
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,120
have to reach

381
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,960
technological independence that we

382
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,919
cannot do it on our own

383
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,720
i don't know whether you agree or not

384
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,000
we cannot

385
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,960
reach breakthrough by a certain vendor

386
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,520
or by a certain integrated on its own

387
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,919
only in partnership in partnership of

388
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,120
vendors

389
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,640
integrators and government agencies yes

390
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,080
government

391
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,000
agencies

392
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,280
independent we need consortiums

393
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,919
which should use strong points of each

394
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,400
of the players if we try to

395
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,600
get

396
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,840
immediate

397
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,200
revenues right now immediate profit in

398
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,720
five ways

399
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,000
in five years we shall still

400
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,240
be lagging behind

401
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,640
all right yes i agree so you have a

402
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,039
comment yes i would like to add i think

403
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,760
it's important we are the producers of

404
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,559
the russian cryptographic uh

405
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,000
security

406
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,280
we look at the situation this way we all

407
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,799
used windows linux

408
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,559
and russian

409
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,360
cryptography is not supported by those

410
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,400
operating systems and we have a big uh

411
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,720
problem of understanding

412
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,240
of russian cryptographic products

413
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,400
for example ssl certificates

414
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,360
the government the ministry of digital

415
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,840
development impose uh

416
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,960
generates the local ssl

417
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,679
certification center

418
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,200
we must

419
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,919
get understanding with the browsers

420
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,960
and operating systems

421
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,200
at the government level at the

422
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,600
legislative level all

423
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,640
modern operating systems local operating

424
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,280
systems browsers have to work with

425
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,440
russian cryptographic providers and

426
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,919
certificates

427
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,280
one more point

428
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,640
in addition to browsers and operating

429
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,720
systems and there are other solutions

430
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,600
that

431
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,400
deal

432
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,840
with

433
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,880
russian security utilization

434
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,720
for instance

435
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,120
we've all

436
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,679
encountered attacks ddos attacks on our

437
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,240
sites including ourselves

438
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,240
so we are being attacked yes we had some

439
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,280
downtime but what would i like to say

440
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,159
now

441
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,840
our domestic services to protect from

442
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,280
ddos in most cases

443
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,559
can't

444
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,120
process the traffic encrypted with a

445
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,360
russian crypto provider they just don't

446
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,200
understand it so

447
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,039
if your website

448
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:21,039
is secured by a domestic uh

449
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,480
tool uh

450
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,240
to protect from videos from kaspersky or

451
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,520
korata you just can't open the sites uh

452
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,880
following ghost

453
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,039
so it's a serious problems problem we're

454
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,679
not working with these vendors so that

455
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,120
their products could understand the

456
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,320
russian ghost and analyze the traffic uh

457
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,799
encrypted according to russian ghost

458
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,280
same problem kaspersky and other

459
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,320
antiviruses when analyzing the traffic

460
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,600
if they can't understand the traffic

461
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,240
just block access to the websites it's a

462
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,240
big problem but it's solvable and now

463
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,760
today with our

464
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,080
technology partners with developers of

465
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,559
operating systems browsers

466
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,200
ddos protection systems we're working on

467
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,559
that and we're hoping this problem is

468
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,360
going to be solved in the near future

469
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,840
sounds extremely optimistically i would

470
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,360
also like to hope

471
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,679
for that

472
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,640
actually it's a great example

473
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,200
uh what uh if uh you make a russian tool

474
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,440
so that they should at least understand

475
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,200
you synchronize the certificates well

476
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,360
the certificates are standard

477
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,840
the question uh is not so much about the

478
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,840
format of uh the certificate but to the

479
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,440
fields and new ideas

480
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,919
that are included there

481
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,159
it's more a question to this

482
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,120
ccas rather than vendors the government

483
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,960
is also trying to

484
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,480
fight with that

485
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,360
law

486
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,959
federal law 93.

487
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,559
a63

488
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,520
also

489
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,320
removes uh restrictions on these uits so

490
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,559
the certificates should be universal and

491
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,799
should be accepted by all products and

492
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,640
different

493
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,559
online marketplaces yes in this

494
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,559
situation i would like to complement the

495
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,480
ministry of digital development because

496
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,600
indeed our colleagues have indeed delved

497
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,000
very deeply into the subject and all

498
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,520
present here

499
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,720
have

500
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,679
encountered the problem of certification

501
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,640
of the domestic websites

502
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,240
and so

503
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,640
the ministry of digital development has

504
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,039
been really involved in this

505
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,960
across the

506
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,840
structures i decided to have a comment

507
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,720
yes

508
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,039
i just wanted to

509
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,600
move the discussion from technology

510
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,520
to people and resources

511
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,320
talking about technology independence

512
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,840
then there should be someone to assure

513
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,039
this independence and in this sense

514
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,880
companies are talking we're talking

515
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,960
about cyber security although it does

516
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,159
apply to it in general companies

517
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,520
that

518
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,440
do development uh in russia in this area

519
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,559
actually there are few and far between

520
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,080
i have run some analytics for the

521
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,240
russian market for myself to see what

522
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,480
companies are there

523
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,840
what

524
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,760
revenues they have how many people are

525
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,159
employed and in fact

526
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,120
it's

527
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,640
very

528
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,400
there are very few

529
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,559
the numbers are very low

530
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,120
and i mean it's also about investing in

531
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,360
r d american companies

532
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,000
are investing in r d

533
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,080
uh no

534
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,440
i

535
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,080
i'm afraid to give the wrong number but

536
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,240
i think they're investing more than the

537
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,240
earnings of all russian

538
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,320
companies

539
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,840
in

540
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,600
in for security

541
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,159
for startups for instance in america

542
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,600
any startup can get 10 to 20 million

543
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,080
dollars it's very easy here in russia

544
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,799
it's just impossible

545
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,360
i'm talking based on my own experience

546
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,760
because my company has also grown from

547
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,440
nothing and we just don't have a venture

548
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,760
industry in cyber in cyber security

549
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,880
people who understand cyber security

550
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,200
enough to be able to invest in it can be

551
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
counted on the fingers of one hand do

552
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,080
you know a lot of companies that have

553
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,240
appeared over the past year or two in

554
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,480
russia for cyber security

555
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,159
not related to some large organizations

556
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,919
some large structures as a subsidiary

557
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,600
very few

558
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,760
and in this sense we need to find our

559
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,919
own approach okay we don't have so much

560
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,000
money that

561
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,159
can be handed out just like in the

562
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,159
american market

563
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,240
but so we need to find

564
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,919
some other systems because we have a lot

565
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,360
of people with good brains

566
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,320
a lot

567
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,120
of

568
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,279
universities that churn out a lot of

569
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,400
professionals but this doesn't

570
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,919
turn into

571
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,919
the an emergence of a large number of

572
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,520
companies creating new technologies i

573
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,159
think the rain lies the problem

574
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,600
how do you think

575
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,840
the problem here

576
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,480
is more about what you've mentioned the

577
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,440
funding

578
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,200
or maybe

579
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,240
the problem is because the regulations

580
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,120
are too harsh so people just can't

581
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,000
start up a company in information

582
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,840
security so like a small company like 30

583
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,000
people so they can't do that not because

584
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,240
they don't have the money for that for

585
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,679
instance they have some speed capital

586
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,760
for that and that they've accumulated

587
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,520
themselves so there's money there's a

588
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,320
team

589
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,360
what other hurdles uh can

590
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,279
be found on the way

591
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,200
maybe uh there are some legal problems

592
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,700
that you can see

593
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,440
[Music]

594
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,039
well perhaps

595
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,279
it's a question of education and

596
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,279
upbringing

597
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,120
of a certain entrepreneurial uh you know

598
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,240
vain in uh people because we don't

599
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,919
really have a lot of people in this

600
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,760
country who are prepared to create their

601
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,480
own businesses even though uh it looks

602
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,559
uh like some institutions have been

603
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,039
organized like skullco for instance uh

604
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,039
it allows

605
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,760
getting grants uh one

606
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,200
for business development by small

607
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
government but it doesn't seem to work

608
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,520
it is not turning into

609
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,840
like a flood of companies and here the

610
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,919
industry could also help i think

611
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,520
in the sense that when we're talking

612
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,720
about technology collaboration it's also

613
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,080
a question

614
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,320
of

615
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,760
growing uh some competitors to yourself

616
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,200
if you look at the western market it

617
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,760
looks normal there large companies

618
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,080
uh understand

619
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,320
that it's easier for them

620
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,400
uh to create the environ environment

621
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,679
where startups

622
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,960
would emerge and then to acquire them

623
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,840
it's easier for them to do than launch

624
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,600
such projects within the corporation

625
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,080
because large corporation are sluggish

626
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,080
and this browser something new are

627
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,720
growing faster as startups

628
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,640
so you need to have

629
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,799
a multi-faceted approach holistic

630
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,279
approach it's not only a question to the

631
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,200
government it's also a question to the

632
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,080
industry so that some collaborations

633
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,240
could emerge that would allow

634
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,240
such companies such as startups

635
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,880
such startup environment to emerge

636
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,799
because now basically it's

637
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,679
non-existent

638
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,039
uh

639
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,480
yeah

640
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,880
you indeed look like super samurais who

641
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,559
appear in the market

642
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,399
that

643
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:41,440
but what's happening with these

644
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,880
companies after that

645
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,200
well according to my observations some

646
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,760
of them manage uh to be bought out by a

647
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,919
larger company or a vendor

648
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,360
in other cases

649
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,279
the projects just get closed

650
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,559
unfortunately

651
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,399
the difficulty

652
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,799
for a new technology business

653
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,799
to turn into something tangible is

654
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,080
indeed a problem

655
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,480
yes it's a small comment i think it's

656
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,880
also a question uh about business

657
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,200
thinking of people my company many years

658
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,080
ago it took part in this kolkavo

659
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,320
contest they were selecting a technology

660
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,080
company for cybersecurity and basically

661
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,039
not a single company that took part this

662
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,000
contest including uh those who won

663
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,760
don't exist anymore even though the

664
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,840
technologies were quite exciting and the

665
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,600
guys uh

666
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,480
top notch but this it was the business

667
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,360
component uh that was lacking a

668
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,760
technical guy

669
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,399
also needs uh to have a business uh

670
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,440
person yes it usually works

671
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,039
like as a bundle

672
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,360
uh everybody knows the apple story there

673
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,440
was vozniaka and jobs one was

674
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,159
responsible for sales and promotion

675
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,080
another one was the technology leader

676
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,158
and driver of the company thank you

677
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,559
you've actually highlighted quite an

678
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,559
important point yes indeed this story

679
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,320
about acquisitions

680
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,120
uh in fact many startups just get

681
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,320
organized

682
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,960
for that sake because many companies are

683
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,039
not prepared uh to

684
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,039
take the whole burden of turning a

685
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,840
startups into technology giant but they

686
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,679
are prepared to

687
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,919
start launch and

688
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,760
maybe get some

689
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,240
funds selling it to a larger player so

690
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,559
my next question uh to sergey you as a

691
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,679
representative a large holding company

692
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,840
for you how does the story look if you

693
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,760
want to

694
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,399
open up a new technology direction in

695
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,399
your company is it

696
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,799
more interesting for you to grow it up

697
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,200
within your company or just find

698
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,960
a company that has developed it in the

699
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,360
market

700
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:52,720
actually

701
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,000
the question is quite interesting

702
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,440
and i would say

703
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,679
you can follow different paths here

704
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,919
depending on how uh

705
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,240
how new this business is to our company

706
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,200
in terms of technology

707
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,200
if you are talking about something

708
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,679
absolutely new and novel then of course

709
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,799
it's much better to find a team of

710
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,440
enthusiasts in the market

711
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,600
that's immersed and very enthusiastic

712
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,159
about this idea this idea drives them

713
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,799
they develop it and that carry it on

714
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:29,120
and this way you can solve the problem

715
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,080
of promoting these ideas for them

716
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,559
so taking these ideas and landing them

717
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,399
to some specific

718
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:37,440
projects

719
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,840
or needs because every product is

720
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,000
developed for some need

721
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,480
and so landing it

722
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,279
to

723
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,360
a very real

724
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,120
practical problems with a customer and

725
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,200
achieving customer satisfaction

726
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,200
is something we can offer them

727
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,399
talk about the second option

728
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,279
when something new

729
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,399
comes as a consequence of something old

730
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,799
that has already existed then in these

731
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,679
cases we quite often focus on our own

732
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,519
development but of course this doesn't

733
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,640
preclude us from adding a new people new

734
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,440
knowledge new uh technologies to them

735
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,240
because the uh problem is about people

736
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,320
their knowledge their experience

737
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,399
uh their worldview

738
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:23,200
their

739
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,200
readiness to share

740
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,039
knowledge we're talking about technology

741
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,600
independence and we understand that we

742
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,720
can't

743
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,360
talk just about cyber security we also

744
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,080
need to include i.t in general in the

745
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,240
discussion and if we're talking about

746
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,840
sustainability

747
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,799
this is also about people and knowledge

748
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,120
so adding new blood to the team

749
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,360
always gives you an impetus for

750
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,960
development

751
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,880
yes clear thank you

752
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,760
i think

753
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,840
it's an important

754
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,159
message maybe to representatives of

755
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,159
small companies here in the conference

756
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,960
you see that large market players are

757
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,720
quite happy going for acquisition

758
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,600
so

759
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,159
the ball's on your turf you just do your

760
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,279
business and you

761
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,880
get what you want

762
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,840
sergey

763
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,480
actually

764
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,679
you

765
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,480
set the stage for the next question so

766
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,640
acquiring knowledge for your

767
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,799
exp

768
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,880
expertise for your company that you uh

769
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,960
haven't yet had

770
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,320
so what kind of

771
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,960
products domestically developed products

772
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,960
are missing in the russian market

773
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,519
compared to all those western similar

774
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,159
projects that we've got used to use so

775
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,399
is every area covered or maybe there are

776
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,960
some uh areas where we don't have

777
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,159
replacement

778
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,000
or maybe uh we have some areas where

779
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,760
it would be built built-in issue string

780
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,760
but it's local well i'm not going to

781
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,919
speak about all products but let me just

782
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,840
share our experience how we see that

783
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,919
after february 24

784
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,919
we've got a lot more work and

785
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,240
everybody's coming to us and are saying

786
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,279
look before that uh before today uh we

787
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,840
spent several years driving a mercedes

788
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,159
cars can you offer us a mercedes belt

789
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,080
built in russia but unfortunately we're

790
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,679
saying we only have a us uh suv u.s

791
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,640
patriot use but if you fix something

792
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,720
there uh you can turn it in something

793
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,600
like a mercedes now everybody

794
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,918
wants

795
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,840
top-notch products

796
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,840
because they've got

797
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,679
they were spoiled by western products

798
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,600
and now they want to have everything

799
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,200
functional and

800
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,320
usable

801
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,600
all in one

802
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,000
package so what are we saying

803
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,240
so we're not going to cover all your

804
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,440
needs with a single project but if you

805
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,360
put together several russian solutions

806
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,000
into a solution then you can get quite a

807
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,960
good solution both safe and secure and

808
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,200
usable we are actively moving in this

809
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,240
direction let's say cisco or connect or

810
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,720
other solutions

811
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,599
it's just not not possible to cover them

812
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,839
with a single product

813
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:14,079
i'm using cisco connect as an example

814
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,079
because what's important it's a vpm or

815
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,599
an mdm in all in one and we have either

816
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,239
vpn or mdn in this market but we have

817
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,960
good products for that uh what you need

818
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,119
uh is to bring them together join them

819
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,879
bundle them in a single single product

820
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,239
and it can be done

821
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,800
so i think you one shouldn't be upset

822
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,239
that something's missing because

823
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,399
everything is there the important thing

824
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:39,918
is uh to

825
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,399
put these lego boxes uh together and

826
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,639
integrate them correctly in the market

827
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,040
well thank you i actually arrived at the

828
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,679
same conclusion

829
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,320
and i'm asking the next question nikolai

830
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,639
who is

831
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,880
how to organize the migration projects

832
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,200
from a zoo

833
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,800
of

834
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,000
western

835
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,359
solutions

836
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:06,240
uh

837
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,640
integrated solutions that have a lot of

838
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,960
functionality

839
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,440
so how to organize the migration process

840
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,480
from them

841
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,000
to some uh combination of combinations

842
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,160
of uh solutions from different vendors

843
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,240
but local one so the customer shouldn't

844
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,079
have a lot of uh

845
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,320
headaches

846
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,800
let me start with single uh what the

847
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,920
customers need from those

848
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,359
combined solutions

849
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,240
because quite often up until a certain

850
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,119
time

851
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,760
security for companies

852
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,760
was not very important

853
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,800
and now

854
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,200
the moment is unique when security has

855
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,359
first started to be measurable

856
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,480
so when uh business goes to the new then

857
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,160
users understand

858
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,960
how much security costs how much it

859
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,920
would cost them to restore a website for

860
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,880
instance

861
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,560
in the past it was like video vendor

862
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,480
like cisco

863
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,760
so you have a respected product

864
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,320
and we just need to employ good uh

865
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,400
people to use this product

866
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,480
so the problem uh now is not really

867
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,960
about replacing something but

868
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,520
about discussing uh dear customer what

869
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,000
you need at all do you need vpn or you

870
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,640
also need mdm or you need both uh do you

871
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,359
need products that gets updated

872
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:26,480
regularly

873
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,800
so the customers come to us and say

874
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,800
replace us forwarding a security system

875
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,480
with a locally made the first thing

876
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,599
we're going to do

877
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,599
is why the customer needs a security

878
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,240
system not just to replace

879
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,800
so if there was one system performing

880
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,040
system here and we are going to install

881
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,160
some russian

882
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,800
so no uh actually uh we start asking the

883
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,160
question of and maybe you should

884
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,599
organize the process completely

885
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:50,720
differently

886
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,640
because indeed the

887
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,720
solutions available in the market allow

888
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,359
covering all practically every uh need

889
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,200
and aspect

890
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,319
of security

891
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,720
and because of the specificity of

892
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,839
regulation this country

893
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,599
uh it's only available as a set of

894
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,440
building blocks uh but in order to

895
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,280
understand which building blogs uh

896
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,920
blocks you are going to need you have to

897
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,320
understand the nature of your needs

898
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,000
i absolutely agree

899
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,839
so

900
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,480
uh but it's more about correctly

901
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,119
managing customers expectations

902
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,880
because if you wanted to cover

903
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,440
everything cover the whole spectrum

904
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,160
uh it's almost uh like the saying about

905
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,440
fighting for everything good again

906
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,599
against everything bad

907
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,079
the concept that our company is

908
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,040
offering their customers today

909
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,440
is basically to focus on a specific

910
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,200
result

911
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,480
so effective cyber security concept to

912
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,800
cover the risks that the customer

913
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,320
believes are the most important not to

914
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,640
try to cover uh the uncoverable but

915
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,680
so that you should put all the ticks in

916
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,520
the boxes

917
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,560
but in fact

918
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,359
one should look at what uh

919
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,119
instills

920
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,280
the biggest ore of

921
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,839
your problems and i think

922
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,359
what point-based solutions you could use

923
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,160
to avoid an event that's inadmissible to

924
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,040
you

925
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,720
and again

926
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,280
sometimes you don't even need to listen

927
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,520
to customers i'm sorry if that sounds a

928
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:38,400
bit harsh i remember in 1990 there was a

929
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,520
boom of accountants everybody was trying

930
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,440
to become an accountant everybody needed

931
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,320
them

932
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:49,520
now uh business is uh not interested

933
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,640
in a black box that's being used so the

934
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,720
business uh so what's inside the black

935
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,520
box the business uh is interested in

936
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,079
what their needs are provided and so a

937
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,240
provider comes to them

938
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,040
and

939
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,520
solves the problem so i think the

940
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,560
optimal

941
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,480
way would be to

942
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,320
go this way so when the business

943
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,880
understands the goals that they have and

944
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,040
don't think about anything else yes i

945
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,720
would probably agree

946
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,520
and

947
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,359
i'll try to gradually move to the next

948
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,839
question uh that popped up in my head

949
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,880
what in this situation look look we as

950
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,320
vendor and integrator representatives

951
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,119
we

952
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,079
are talking to customers in one way or

953
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,720
the other so we start communicating and

954
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,320
we'll try to manage

955
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,200
their

956
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,280
expectations correctly

957
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,240
so

958
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,800
if the customers don't understand what

959
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,960
they really need but the topic of our

960
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,640
today session

961
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,359
is about the huge tectonic shift to

962
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:50,320
change

963
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,320
the environment

964
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,079
so that this country

965
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,359
should gain this technology sovereignty

966
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,000
so i think

967
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,079
this is the question i would like to ask

968
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,200
you what we would want to have

969
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,079
for

970
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,400
the professionals to get

971
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,880
support from the government maybe not

972
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,200
binary support maybe some methodologies

973
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,200
what is the vendor you are expecting to

974
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,440
get from the state i must say that our

975
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,359
president vladimir putin has made a

976
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:21,839
great present to this whole industry

977
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,280
i i

978
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,800
recall order number 250 of the first may

979
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,079
of this year

980
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,920
uh that

981
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,400
includes the personal responsibility for

982
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,040
for the ceo of the ceo for information

983
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,040
security if something's happening

984
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,640
especially

985
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,119
if we're talking about

986
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,839
a critical infrastructure site

987
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,800
if we take a look at

988
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,520
article 274.1

989
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,359
in the criminal codes we'll see

990
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,720
that it implies a prison for 10 years up

991
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,240
to 10 years so i think it's a great

992
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,400
motivator unfortunately

993
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,839
we have to state

994
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,480
that any general discussions or

995
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,760
persuasion

996
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,079
are not effective enough so what is

997
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,280
working is either the whole company has

998
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,560
been

999
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,000
deleted or encrypted

1000
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,440
or the president issues an order like uh

1001
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,520
ordered 250.

1002
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,800
again uh base back to this order it's

1003
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,760
not all that's bad for the ceo they can

1004
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,160
delegate these responsibilities

1005
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,680
to their subordinates so we're not

1006
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,800
expecting

1007
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,800
the next

1008
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,920
government's

1009
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,319
decree

1010
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,760
detailing uh the requirements for

1011
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,720
the

1012
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,160
deputy

1013
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,760
ceo

1014
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,280
vice president

1015
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,760
and there would be a separate

1016
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,800
regulation for the functionality of

1017
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,839
information security department helping

1018
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:58,160
uh this responsible person

1019
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,200
well pavel uh suggests that 10 years in

1020
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,280
prison should be replaced by a work in a

1021
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,599
startup well there's an option you can

1022
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,040
use that

1023
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,800
but it's been rightly noted

1024
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,280
that indeed historically

1025
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,000
even in the west

1026
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:18,319
i just use the custom even saying even

1027
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,480
but historically nowhere

1028
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,200
the

1029
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,960
information security

1030
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,440
functions

1031
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,119
for the top management

1032
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,960
has been considered by as a business

1033
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,960
function it's always been kind of a

1034
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,960
commodity some low level support

1035
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,640
function uh that you could save on

1036
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,280
that you could keep forgetting until the

1037
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,520
last day until something really drastic

1038
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,560
happened

1039
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,480
and indeed we can send our thanks uh to

1040
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,200
uh

1041
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,599
putin and presidential administrations

1042
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,359
because uh

1043
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:54,400
decree 250 it gave

1044
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,079
this push

1045
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,800
yes and what it told the market is that

1046
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,720
this indeed is important and you have to

1047
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,800
deal with that can i also come in uh

1048
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,400
with a brief comment

1049
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,359
uh actually i didn't uh have tongue in

1050
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:09,359
cheek when i was saying that

1051
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:10,960
because the

1052
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,960
uh decree uh applies to a very broad

1053
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,880
range of companies

1054
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,000
and so like us cryptocrow

1055
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,920
are a strategic company a company that's

1056
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,680
strategic for the russian economy and i

1057
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,280
think that a lot of information security

1058
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,720
and i.t companies are going to be part

1059
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,800
of become part of this list so it's not

1060
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,240
just for us

1061
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,480
and some other people

1062
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,040
should take a look and start laughing

1063
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,200
watching how other people do we

1064
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,280
ourselves

1065
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,200
are involved here directly and we're

1066
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,680
already discussing the future

1067
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,599
instructions and orders for the

1068
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,200
information security people in

1069
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,040
departments i

1070
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,200
completely agree it is indeed a very

1071
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,800
useful initiative

1072
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,599
and

1073
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,760
i fully agree

1074
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,720
so the market has started to really grow

1075
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,760
i mean the domestic market i think all

1076
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,839
uh the colleagues here

1077
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,359
have felt

1078
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:08,960
a growth in demand for the activities of

1079
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,880
our colleagues the market started to

1080
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,520
grow financially budgets started to be

1081
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,920
allocated

1082
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,000
more pilots started to be run

1083
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,200
and perhaps

1084
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,040
i don't know if

1085
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,680
you can do it in eurovision or bible and

1086
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,200
crypto pro

1087
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,760
maybe some uh new uh

1088
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,839
product development directions have

1089
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:33,599
started so indeed

1090
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:37,520
order 250 very strong push to our

1091
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,720
domestic market well unfortunately

1092
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,200
all the subjects that

1093
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,000
are being discussed in our positive hack

1094
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,720
days are very broad and so we're running

1095
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,800
out of time unfortunately so i would

1096
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,240
like to wrap up this session uh with a

1097
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,359
quick uh series of quick questions

1098
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,920
yeah i'm just curious to see if my own

1099
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,560
analysis coincides with what you have in

1100
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,599
your heads so there would be a blitz

1101
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:06,720
questionnaire

1102
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,760
so just one or two three words

1103
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,240
the focus where we should concentrate

1104
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,119
now to successfully provide the

1105
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,040
technology sovereignty that

1106
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,839
we want to achieve just one to three

1107
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:20,880
words

1108
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,680
who is prepared to be the first

1109
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,440
technology partnership

1110
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,760
thank you

1111
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,560

1112
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,330
people and

1113
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:35,449

1114
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,280
investment great perfect thank you and

1115
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,480
sergey

1116
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,079
integration and bit thank you

1117
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,520
security in my team

1118
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,640
thank you so basically all answers

1119
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,119
coincided with the focus points that i

1120
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:57,040
have in my mind yes indeed we need to

1121
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,200
invest in people invest in ideas

1122
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,520
providing people

1123
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,480
a way

1124
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,119
to develop those ideas invest in r d and

1125
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,680
do it in a single front

1126
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,119
together because in the current

1127
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,079
situation i don't think we'll be able to

1128
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:15,280
survive alone so we need colleagues that

1129
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,480
get together

1130
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,880
the future is on that those lines thank

1131
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,960
