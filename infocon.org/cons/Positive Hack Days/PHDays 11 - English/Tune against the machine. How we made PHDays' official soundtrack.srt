[Music]

8
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,280
okay then i asked the guys what about

9
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,800
that official intelligence and google

10
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
tell us well that's everything

11
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,759
if you want uh nirvana here is uh here

12
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,320
is a track it is positioned

13
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,880
as the one made by ai

14
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,000
and

15
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,040
so

16
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,840
it's somewhere from the machine you know

17
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,520
okay i said okay if people do it and

18
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,199
then i can do it as well i'm a computer

19
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,759
guy anyway

20
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,880
and many of you heard the project uh

21
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,039
neuron defense so you read the text

22
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,680
there and so you would say okay they

23
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,120
would have

24
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,680
do it would have done it like that so i

25
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,680
got relaxed i started doing some other

26
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,759
things i thought okay

27
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:25,000
i'll set it out i mean how to do it

28
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,919
so when i

29
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,360
reached this practical steps i

30
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,120
understood okay it's time

31
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,280
to use this magic of artificial

32
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,039
intelligence to make a cool track

33
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,759
i went to some balalaika added some

34
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,440
settings uh in google i took the gp

35
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,280
dpo plan

36
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,400
it said come back in 24 hours so i did

37
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,440
and that's

38
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,840
what came

39
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,800
well okay

40
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,039
i believe three months uh not enough

41
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,880
anymore

42
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,479
well on the other hand you're gonna have

43
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,319
a soundtrack people can play like that

44
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,319
anyway i believe that many of you have

45
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,520
heard this

46
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,479
or seen this video

47
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,360
so you can hear

48
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:23,160
[Music]

49
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,759
and when i have this proposal like maybe

50
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,759
it's a cool soundtrack an alternative

51
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,280
version of soundtrack

52
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,720
i was told

53
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,800
that this wouldn't work out

54
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,280
okay i started looking into this

55
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,560
kind of world of difference between

56
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,280
this two different things

57
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,880
okay

58
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,319
it turned out

59
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,560
that many things which are positioned as

60
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,039
music directed by ai

61
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,599
is not really like that

62
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,759
so these are some bits and pieces which

63
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,919
are taken from here and there

64
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,840
so they play it on their own or they

65
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,520
generate only the lyrics and the sounds

66
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,280
and other things

67
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,479
are made by

68
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,599
people

69
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,160
and um so the only

70
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,120
kind of completely

71
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,960
ai based uh

72
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,599
album is the panca opera

73
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,280
which is

74
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,759
developed by the jukebox

75
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,720
and it's difficult to listen to but it's

76
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,599
truly

77
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,919
generated by ai the text

78
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:26,880
and

79
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,039
the music

80
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,520
one more example unfortunately i

81
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,520
couldn't put it in here because it's the

82
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,960
streaming youtube

83
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,080
video

84
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,919
and this is

85
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,120
a kind of kind of death metal stream the

86
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,080
truth so you just uh have it

87
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,240
and you have it there

88
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,759
it's the endless

89
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,800
metadata like that

90
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,120
and vicar told me that this

91
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,720
wouldn't be good for the phds

92
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,759
i started digging deeper

93
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,280
and

94
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,400
my hard drive was kind of overloaded

95
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,919
like you know the dumping ground for

96
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,599
the the nil we don't need anymore and so

97
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,360
many tracks i didn't want either

98
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,879
and then a kind of breakthrough came

99
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,960
i was dealing with another blood icon

100
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,280
and it gave me

101
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,400
this

102
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,479
melody

103
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,919
you can hear it

104
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,598
and i was really touched by it

105
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,880
and i remembered my old idea when i was

106
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,479
a young kid

107
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,959
i was dealing with various

108
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,160
viruses

109
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,640
like a scale slammer and other ones and

110
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,640
i was converting them into samples and i

111
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,399
was trying to drain some music into it

112
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,160
so i wasn't the smartest guy it wasn't

113
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,120
my invention

114
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,080
describe it in his

115
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,600
novel

116
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,800
the net

117
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,080
or power tina so i took this melody and

118
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,160
added there

119
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,360
using the text-to-speech i'll edit here

120
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,399
various uh phrases from viruses so i

121
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,440
generated samples added them here

122
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,920
and one of the guys

123
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,719
one of my friends

124
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,680
which gives you strange

125
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,560
sounds and it has the button random i

126
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,120
pressed it about 20 times and some

127
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,360
interesting things popped up quite

128
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,440
chaotic and epic

129
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,120
and um

130
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,680
somebody liked it but not the ai

131
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,239
which kind of generated

132
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,760
have some challenges

133
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,640
well indeed they can distract you

134
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,360
from my speech but hopefully you'll be

135
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,640
interested so we have this three

136
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,839
vanillas so this is exactly the

137
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,880
soundtrack and you can

138
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,720
go to the youtube

139
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,090

[Music]

141
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,760
you can use the qr code

142
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,839
and if you recognize more viruses in

143
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,519
this music

144
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,920
so we will be given

145
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,880
this

146
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,360
video so it has text of speech and there

147
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,640
are

148
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,720
various

149
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,120
phrases

150
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,800
mention them so you should find out what

151
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,480
their virus is

152
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,320
okay

153
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,079
i need a team to help me

154
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,880
okay i found several people

155
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,959
who are ready to listen to this

156
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,160
horrible things this is anatoly ruptov

157
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,320
like to thank him very much for this

158
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,399
because he used to be

159
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,600
the akadah electronic music player

160
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,640
metalist

161
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,079
and my friend vladimir

162
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:00,959
has been

163
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,839
a musician all his life and he

164
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,680
plays table tennis now

165
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,959
okay

166
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,359
anyway

167
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,800
needed to develop the product

168
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
and uh i

169
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,279
talked to ernest i have dealt

170
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,200
worked together for a long time he was

171
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,440
very skeptical about it or at least

172
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,560
initially

173
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,560
maybe he is still quite skeptical about

174
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,519
it

175
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,200
and after a couple of iterations

176
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,560
he

177
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,959
agreed

178
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,880
i shared the tracks with several people

179
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,959
they said okay it's symphonic and

180
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,680
epic but the hacker conference

181
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,480
is

182
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,279
about ccc

183
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,920
and there the soundtrack

184
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,360
should be something like that so that

185
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,120
you won't do this

186
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,200
it should be symphonic

187
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,680
okay

188
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,240
this is not my music at all i don't

189
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,839
listen to this type of music and i had

190
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,519
to be inspired

191
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,880
that's why

192
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,920
i started listening to ebitda global

193
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,320
radio all the time and i was listening

194
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,680
this until i was fed up with it

195
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,399
and

196
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,360
then

197
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,760
the neural network i believe there

198
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,360
should be some music

199
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,360
now

200
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,560
so it gave me some

201
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,800
music like that

202
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
and i changed

203
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,600
so it gives me the standard midi file

204
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,160
so the

205
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,279
so that's what it looked like initially

206
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,040
so this isn't looking but it should be

207
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,399
like ccc

208
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,560
that's why i changed

209
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,959
the instruments so it became like the

210
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,480
rave music

211
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,120
i didn't do anything to it i just

212
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,320
arranged it

213
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,720
a little bit

214
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,560
and

215
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,479
i found a good sample pack

216
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,680
called

217
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,880
string

218
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,000
reverb

219
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,279
and the guys there did a non-traditional

220
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,519
sound

221
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,240
making from

222
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,000
the strings

223
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,120
or the grand piano so they

224
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,920
were

225
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,800
throwing hammers at it and so on and uh

226
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,639
this generated

227
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,800
this space-like sound

228
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,200
so all of this came from the strings

229
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,360
so this is the strings theory and this

230
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,360
is how our

231
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,199
universe came around

232
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,240
so this was done within one day because

233
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,000
the neural network understood what i

234
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,199
wanted

235
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,160
some technical details how all of that

236
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,920
works

237
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,279
well the idea of developing music

238
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,320
looks like the nlp

239
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,279
task

240
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,279
i've dealt with it quite extensively for

241
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,399
the last three years

242
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,920
and in nlp the important thing is to

243
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,800
predict the symbol or the word or the

244
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,920
sentence to follow for this they use r

245
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,199
and n

246
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,320
they use the beam search and other

247
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,959
technologies

248
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,680
issues with rnn for music

249
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,440
i like that

250
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,920
well music has several layers and these

251
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,800
are dependent layers so when we speak

252
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,240
we say one word at a time and if we say

253
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,440
five words

254
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,040
at the same time i mean different people

255
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,800
this will be chaotic

256
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,959
so

257
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,160
well you cannot

258
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,040
listen

259
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,600
to different phrases uh

260
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,839
sank at the same time

261
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,639
and in music

262
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,000
we have many too many instruments

263
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,240
telling their own story

264
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,600
so

265
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,880
[Music]

266
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,000
they can

267
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,399
kind of

268
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,880
write a melody that's okay that's a

269
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,920
sequence

270
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,839
of sounds

271
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,480
and we know that uh notes have their

272
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,399
length so this is another kind of

273
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,800
measurement

274
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,399
they used

275
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,079
convolutional neural networks the cnns

276
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,600
well this is a kind of a 2d picture

277
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
the sedans so you know those who deal

278
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,360
with pictures so you can

279
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,880
give them

280
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,040
more dimensions

281
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,000
and

282
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,959
here

283
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,680
we have run into an issue

284
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,199
dimensions like that are all

285
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,480
interrelated so if you

286
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,720
have uh

287
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,880
say

288
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,160
b minor so you should

289
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,880
know that

290
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,639
well all these things are

291
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,079
interdependent

292
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,399
and um

293
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,279
so

294
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,920
today so this we use now we use uh

295
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,360
adversarial networks and we use auto

296
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,399
encoders

297
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,959
so it looks like zipper zip when you

298
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,240
have a function

299
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,800
to reduce

300
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,839
your

301
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,920
data environment

302
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,079
or scope and then it

303
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,959
unzips it and you can use generative

304
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,639
approach so that you don't have the same

305
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,720
output for the input

306
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,360
so we have a good article

307
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,199
here is a link and this is a kind of an

308
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,399
introduction

309
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,660
so if you want to understand this

310
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,959
[Music]

311
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,800
and there are quite a lot of examples

312
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,639
for training and for practical

313
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,560
application

314
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,439
so there are many of

315
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,839
them okay

316
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,120
two tracks are there so i should proceed

317
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,040
okay positive hack days is a hacker

318
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,759
conference so it should be about uh

319
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,480
hacking and

320
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,919
hackers the neural network

321
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,520
gave me a track

322
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,959
with one short

323
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,359
like tom stomps

324
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,400
and

325
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,359
good for

326
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,280
dancing

327
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,319
and i thought about things to do

328
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,480
i just asked it yes

329
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,919
to read the

330
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,640
hacker manifest

331
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,599
okay i thought about the voice to pick

332
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,480
so i found

333
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,120
a model

334
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,720
which spoke the hell 9000 uh voice

335
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,520
so this is the space odyssey

336
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,080
computer it's kind of a

337
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,320
hacker which tried to hack people and

338
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,799
then people hacked it so this is the

339
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,120
human machine interface

340
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,280
well it's worked out quite

341
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,720
nicely so the track was pretty

342
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,320
quickly developed

343
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,120
the next track

344
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,840
with little participation of neural

345
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,280
networks

346
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,520
so this is a long lasting thing i

347
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,400
mentioned at congresses

348
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,600
when we

349
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,200
talked about uh hacking railways

350
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,120
i'm a real well expert

351
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,200
by my professional training

352
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,679
so i talked about the relay rooms the

353
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,760
really rooms are even greater than the

354
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,120
computer halls

355
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,440
so there you go you have the cabinets

356
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,600
and the other side and

357
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,240
uh rooms you have a lot of life

358
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,559
so the list are clicking

359
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,440
so here this is the

360
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,120
phone

361
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,760
so people can determine by sound uh the

362
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,000
number being called and it's all making

363
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,520
a lot of sounds it's all alive

364
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,600
so remember in this pre computer time so

365
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,679
this is the mechanical computer time i

366
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,240
would say

367
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,430
[Music]

368
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,280
quickly generated a track

369
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,240
based

370
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,600
on the sound of various mechanical

371
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,520
calculating devices like teletypes

372
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,320
indicate step

373
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,919
phone exchanges

374
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,080
and

375
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,679
computers

376
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,360
i dealt with when i was young

377
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,039
so in terms of research on this

378
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,559
is that

379
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,280
we have the open source release for

380
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,879
computers so we have

381
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,559
guys assembling this with the drawings

382
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,400
and uh for this

383
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
some languages are kind of added so that

384
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,280
you can

385
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,400
run it it has 25 hertz salmon

386
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,720
so this is

387
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,979
[Music]

388
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,039
the final achievement of this really

389
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,039
computers

390
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,440
was the calculations for the first

391
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,480
nuclear

392
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,400
bombs so transistors and lamps were used

393
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,640
to fly to the space

394
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,240
well the first

395
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,039
nuclear reactions were

396
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,520
calculated by the mechanic

397
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,799
machines

398
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,240
okay the next track

399
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,400
so i wanted to do something like that i

400
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,840
believe that many of you

401
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,679
know the project uh

402
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,520
apathy

403
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,240
for patron this is done by a polish guy

404
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,760
called pavel

405
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,280
and the idea was that we'll have

406
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,600
a media file

407
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,400
we will

408
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,559
launch

409
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,559
so we'll have a video like that

410
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,000
but well you know what happened in

411
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,360
february

412
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,000
and some international activities died

413
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,240
off

414
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,600
well i didn't drop the idea

415
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,360
i found

416
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,080
a great sample pack

417
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,840
where you have sounds of hd ldd

418
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,559
and

419
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,679
whatever

420
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,080
loading computers and so on so i just

421
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,640
used this sample pack

422
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,960
for the

423
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,919
so here we have non-computer

424
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,440
voices but well all of this is samples

425
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,280
and so on so this is the robot music

426
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:30,400
well

427
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,360
indeed

428
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,480
to generate music i didn't use ai here

429
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,520
since if you add chaos to a chaos it's

430
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,960
too much of cats

431
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,280
and then i try to fit something to it so

432
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,360
it should erase something with this

433
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,400
sound

434
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,520
it worked even worse

435
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,880
so that's why i did all that

436
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,200
manually so this simple pack so the guys

437
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,919
use contact at last microphones so you

438
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,360
can see how various sounds were

439
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,400
taken

440
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,520
from this

441
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,840
uh devices and hardware so maybe you

442
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,600
like me can remember how this get 25 is

443
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,159
not being read when you install windows

444
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,880
98 to use that

445
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,080
one more

446
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,120
challenge

447
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,919
like your code you can go there

448
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,080
and

449
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,039
you can add to the comment the

450
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,520
names of various robot teams you know

451
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,840
well when i was bringing together this

452
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,280
video clip i found that there are many

453
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,880
of them

454
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,120
so the robots are now singing songs and

455
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,640
this is great

456
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,600
and now the floor goes to ernest i will

457
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,799
talk about

458
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,159
his view

459
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,960
of the project

460
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,590
okay hello everyone

461
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:57,840
[Music]

462
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,039
i could hardly understand what was going

463
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,559
on when we were doing it so what kind of

464
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,480
you know outlandish things

465
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,720
i started doing because uh

466
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,960
i had been dealing with

467
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,080
all my life with proper music and i was

468
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,240
cleaning up things leveling up things

469
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,360
played by

470
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,880
various musicians

471
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,120
so i've been cleaning it up and making

472
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,080
it perfect to make it sound

473
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,880
as great as possible and then i received

474
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,039
the material which

475
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,520
broke all the music standards because

476
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,799
it's not

477
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,280
generated

478
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,720
by people but rather robots

479
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,480
and the things i

480
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,679
kind of got used to like

481
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,360
some melodies

482
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,240
some

483
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,480
harmony swings

484
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,679
so when you have shivers and

485
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,000
you just feel high

486
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,880
and i was dealing with the folk teams

487
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,320
and all of that was quite uh mild like

488
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,000
you know

489
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,840
there's a biggest brick band

490
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,120
and here is

491
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,799
this electronic music well initially i

492
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,159
was overwhelmed by then i got

493
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,159
engaged

494
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,480
and i spent some time thinking that the

495
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,440
sound ahead of time music so in the

496
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,760
digital audio workstations

497
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,640
work

498
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,480
is to large extent related

499
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,720
to the programming process

500
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,080
so when i started developing developing

501
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,520
dealing with development i understood

502
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,600
that there are many similarities there

503
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,480
like the online styles

504
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,360
so

505
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,120
things you do

506
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,159
for the

507
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,960
clip video

508
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,400
oh some style related issues

509
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,279
like css

510
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,039
so this is something

511
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,400
you can

512
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,679
do for

513
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,120
the whole

514
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,039
track some plugins

515
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,080
some functions like loops

516
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,279
and some

517
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,640
repeated

518
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,000
elements of reused elements as so

519
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,720
so

520
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,200
when music

521
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,720
being made

522
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,880
using computers

523
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,799
many similarities emerged in terms of

524
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,720
design computers and music and video so

525
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,679
many reversal things kind of popped up

526
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,200
so you can explain

527
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,720
music

528
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,159
or using

529
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,880
various computer methodologies

530
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,640
i want everything

531
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,799
to be aligned and

532
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,720
strict

533
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,919
no more that hoven will not forgive me

534
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,760
if i

535
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,440
do something

536
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,919
i cannot interpret in the music like

537
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,000
language then my friends will tell me

538
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,840
ernest what have you done you have

539
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,360
betrayed music

540
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,400
okay

541
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,840
so i had to somehow explain it to myself

542
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,600
how ai can be used for music

543
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,639
so i found

544
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,480
two

545
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,480
different ways to understand how you can

546
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,919
use

547
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,360
artificial intelligence in music

548
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,600
i have mentioned the ibm methodology you

549
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,679
know and there you have a kind of

550
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,840
principle

551
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,799
of code segregation when you take

552
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,480
one element

553
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,080
and use it

554
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,960
in another project and you just move it

555
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,559
so this is

556
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,799
not well

557
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,000
some um

558
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,480
there's a principle of

559
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,919
poor cohesion

560
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,400
in the code and the same we have in

561
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,960
music so music can be

562
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,279
uh program related to not programmatic

563
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,240
okay

564
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,720
sonate 13 okay what is it about no but

565
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,320
no oh symphony

566
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,919
40

567
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,240
by mozart nobody knows that this

568
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,159
and you can compare it

569
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,480
with money by greg so you open it and

570
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,320
you hear it like

571
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,520
so you understand that it's morning

572
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,000
the sunrise so we have a kind of

573
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,200
relation to

574
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,240
an image

575
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,360
so and

576
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,200
this is uh

577
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,480
and it's

578
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,559
related to an image so you have some

579
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,679
visual image so this is a kind of link

580
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,240
so ai

581
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,480
well it can do

582
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,039
good things it can play music for the

583
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,039
gamer

584
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,120
process when something happens in the

585
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,320
screen ai can calculate

586
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,279
or enumerate

587
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,679
the game

588
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,320
process and there are some synchronous

589
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,320
audio tracks

590
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,279
and some dramatic events

591
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,640
the ai can highlight the dramatic track

592
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,000
and

593
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,039
suppress

594
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,279
the track

595
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,919
comma in a way

596
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,799
and this way this transition can be

597
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,120
performed by ai

598
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,559
and

599
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,200
so this is now used in the games

600
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,520
so people go somewhere

601
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,480
the environment is changed and so the

602
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,799
environment and the frequency and other

603
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,120
things are changed so all the things

604
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,120
we do

605
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,919
so we listen to the music and we as

606
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,840
music directors we determine where the

607
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,080
estimates should be played and ai does

608
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,720
it

609
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,000
alive

610
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,880
when

611
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,679
you have a game

612
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,399
so you're moving there and the ai

613
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,679
decides how to process uh the music and

614
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:16,640
uh

615
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,559
some other things and as sergey have

616
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,360
mentioned yeah i can generate buttons

617
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,159
and sound patterns okay

618
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,919
what ai cannot do the way i say it

619
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:32,240
how shall we proceed and can we do it

620
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,640
and can we get there

621
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,600
it is

622
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,679
the issue of creating melody

623
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,600
the melodies created by the ai are not

624
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,200
sufficiently

625
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,440
persuasive it can

626
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,840
tweak and trick

627
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,440
add some some changes but cannot develop

628
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,600
the melody because

629
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,399
music has some science called melodica

630
00:29:58,399 --> 00:29:59,279
and

631
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,039
there are some structures that need to

632
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,039
be taken into account and i think you

633
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,279
need to understand it

634
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,399
there are some

635
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,520
some uh starters some question and

636
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,840
answer principles

637
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,960
yeah the crying mozart here

638
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,440
is their music

639
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:34,159
[Music]

640
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,840
something is wrong here right

641
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,520
we hear a stylization

642
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,990
some some styling

643
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:46,799
[Music]

644
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,200
so yeah we can stop it so what did we

645
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,760
hear we heard

646
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,640
the idea of the ai

647
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,399
trying to

648
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:57,919
copy mozart

649
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:58,720
it's

650
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,679
not

651
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,720
beautiful just something even

652
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,840
within harmony and written but this does

653
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,559
not create emotions within us

654
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:09,679
why so

655
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:10,640
because

656
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,919
the melodic melodics

657
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,000
if i had a keyboard i would show it to

658
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,960
you

659
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,279
but if we

660
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,240
analyze the melody by

661
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,000
mozart it has

662
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,970
questions and answers like

663
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:28,240
[Music]

664
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,720
one phrase answering the other phrase

665
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,320
you can represent it in some way

666
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,440
and

667
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,600
it enables us to create a logical

668
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,919
structure

669
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,559
for the long distance it's not just

670
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,200
fragments

671
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,240
very well defined in the games when you

672
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,279
know the story changes constantly but

673
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,200
the music by itself

674
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,519
cannot be like this you know us playing

675
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,640
a game would not be listenable

676
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,320
so we need some long-term development

677
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,200
and

678
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,320
the

679
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,640
melodics is uh very well played on the

680
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,480
long distances

681
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,600
so it has a difficult structure complex

682
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,679
structure that is evolving it's quite

683
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,840
forgotten currently but babar and mozart

684
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,720
their

685
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,000
sonatas symphonies and

686
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,519
corals they

687
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,440
are mathematically defined especially

688
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,200
the fugas

689
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,360
currently it's more emotional

690
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,039
but if we analyze the classic music then

691
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,000
it's more of a math

692
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,640
so the a currently does not

693
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,200
he's not able to copy this mathematics

694
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,000
and

695
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,880
thus i don't appreciate ai being very

696
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,240
good at music further on

697
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,159
name me a conservator

698
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,840
conservative guy

699
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,080
coming back to the music and

700
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,559
i was an author of three pieces on this

701
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,380

[Music]

703
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,559
think of ai in this in this sense and

704
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,640
the sergey was moving

705
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,480
true hardcore

706
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,440
way

707
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,240
creating uh

708
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,360
broad

709
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,080
work generating a lot of things through

710
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,600
ai

711
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,880
i did

712
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,760
you know a less high quality job trying

713
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,480
to create the melody by myself

714
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,679
and giving the background to hey

715
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,760
even then i was you know mixing parts

716
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,760
and adding some rhythmic structures to

717
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,799
the ai and it was giving me some

718
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:53,279
some response and i was mixing them up

719
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,080
heading tracks

720
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,440
and only finding the pieces that would

721
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,679
suit my taste

722
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,919
so there was a lot of selection and i'm

723
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,720
a perfectionist and

724
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,960
conservative person and that's cool

725
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,320
because

726
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,440
in that sense our duo with sergey was

727
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,440
very interesting i'm super open to all

728
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,800
the new

729
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,918
things

730
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,879
all experiments

731
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,040
and it's super cool that is my first

732
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,879
experience very interesting

733
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,960
i'm glad i had to rethink a lot of

734
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,879
things

735
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,280
the only issue i had as i'm less of a

736
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,679
program oriented person but more you

737
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,399
know abstract thinking a thinker about

738
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,040
music i don't try to connect my music

739
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,520
with something the issue was

740
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,599
that you know i could not name those

741
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,839
tracks

742
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,040
this was something like this in my head

743
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,800
how can the music have some name i i

744
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,880
don't know i thought it's you know

745
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,119
it downgrades the music sergey was

746
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,440
helping me i was giving him ideas and he

747
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,640
was helping me choose

748
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,598
names to my tracks

749
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,040
i'm very thankful to him and with that

750
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,359
i'm giving the mic back to sergey thank

751
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:22,359
you

752
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,280
okay this one works

753
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,720
good

754
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,720
so

755
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,000
was helping me listen to

756
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,760
the tracks and i had a lot of doubts

757
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,880
about some of the tracks

758
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,640
and one of the tracks

759
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,160
called paranoid androids

760
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,960
all the colleagues whom i sent it they

761
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,040
said no this doesn't work and then i

762
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,640
said it's cool

763
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,520
and i was able to finish it up and

764
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,160
make it a good one

765
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,560
able to create great

766
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,240
great

767
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,119
music so i had to

768
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,079
include scene wave into the album

769
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,839
and uh

770
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,440
for the net cops

771
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,240
it was exactly what i wanted i stopped

772
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,839
doing anything

773
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:39,839
and said yeah this is this is the one

774
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,000
also an interesting story about the

775
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,160
names and associations that different

776
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,280
people

777
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,680
have when they listen to the same music

778
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,839
also the melody

779
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:52,839
was an

780
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:54,640
issue the

781
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,200
melodies maybe you have you know four

782
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,040
texts of something good and then you

783
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,160
know it becomes

784
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,200
non-listenable so i will have to

785
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,280
separately talk about what works and

786
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,599
what doesn't

787
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:10,960
so

788
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,000
at least

789
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,440
we somehow

790
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,640
finished the music part

791
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,839
but then it was the question of singing

792
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,440
this is the computer singing

793
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,400
and

794
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,079
if you know how the computer is named

795
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,400
then you get a prize

796
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,440
so synthesizing vocals

797
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,480
is a

798
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,560
is an old task people have been trying

799
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,760
to solve it for quite a while and if you

800
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,720
understand

801
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,000
that text-to-speech is quite okay vocals

802
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
are still not covered very well

803
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,800
approaches currently used are

804
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,560
traditional fm synthesis

805
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,800
and

806
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,359
create a human-like

807
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:10,960
structure those blocks

808
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,440
really sound like vocals and you can

809
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,079
even make them sound like voice

810
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,079
but a simpler and more widespread

811
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,160
approach are samples

812
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,160
sampled words that you

813
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,480
tune

814
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,440
it sounds okay vocaloid is a very

815
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,119
popular tool there is a free

816
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,440
analog it's called synthesizer 5.

817
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,040
it has an hmm and samples

818
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,920
so what it does it processes the ready

819
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,400
samples with the words

820
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,520
through

821
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,119
the marvel models

822
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,880
and adds some variants

823
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,440
this is close to vocals

824
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,520
and also there are neural net approaches

825
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,800
i used the diffsinger i couldn't launch

826
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,200
the deep singer

827
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:14,279
and i used the glitch

828
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,839
that was uh you know dedicated to

829
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,400
tokyo code blue conference i hope

830
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,400
someone will sing but of course due to

831
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,760
what happened

832
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,280
the guy said no not now

[Music]

834
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,599
that's why that track has three vocal

835
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:38,320
parts one vocal is sampled vocal

836

women's vocals created in a vocaloid

838
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,000
singing in russian in english and male

839
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,560
vocals that i created using a neural net

840
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,640
it was based

841
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,359
i had to train it

842
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,079
so i trained it on vocaloid vocals

843
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:02,720
because i cannot you know sing japanese

844
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,160
that was a funny story because the model

845
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,079
that worked well

846
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,440
was trained for chinese and english and

847
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,160
it

848
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,640
was not very successful in the japanese

849
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,079
so i

850
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,480
asked my

851
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,839
knowledgeable

852
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:21,119

853
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,119
speaker one

854
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,040
some of the phrases had to be removed

855
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,319
but in the end her nest has you know put

856
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:31,680
it into a

857
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,520
very very solid

858
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,200
theme that sounds like a wall you

859
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,960
understand it's a chorus

860
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,520
and it's not it sounds like narrative

861
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,960
but not

862
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,680
has you know words that that work

863
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,440
separately

864
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,599
and as i promised we are

865
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,400
asking the audience

866
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,960
for a price

867
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,920
what is this pc let's ask google

868
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,880
if you

869
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,720
comment

870
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,880
the glitch track

871
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,640
with the name of the song then you'll

872
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,839
get a disk

873
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,839
this is all electronic music

874
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,400
i was tired of it at some point in time

875
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,040
because it's not my music and i decided

876
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,960
i need to

877
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,839
do some rock

878
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,000
so what i did was an interesting

879
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,480
experiment

880
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,040
i took

881
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,800
one that i like a lot

882
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,200
and put it into a neural net as a seat

883
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,439
to initialize the weights

884
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,240
and among 100 variants 100 options it

885
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,319
gave me i chose the one that i liked

886
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,079
most

887
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,400
so now

888
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,560
and it worked quite well it took the

889
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,880
harmonica well

890
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,280
but the composition sounded very very

891
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,319
solid with kazan metal band

892
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,000
playing together

893
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,560
with an air

894
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,520
and also we had a

895
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,880
great

896
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,920
team

897
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,720
cyber commands that we played together

898
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,880
with

899
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,560
one more track

900
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,920
a very similar one is

901
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,040
not

902
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,319
yet published it will be presented today

903
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:51,440
on positive ways

904
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,440
the neural net has created something

905
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,680
very classic

906
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,920
but for me it sounded very much like

907
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,040
night wish metal band

908
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:10,160
i tweaked it a little bit and sent it to

909
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,880
true metal people who

910
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,119
like that music and they said yeah this

911
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,839
is this is okay but i need we need more

912
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:19,920
voice and you know some

913
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,040
the midi midi beam beam sound is not

914
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,359
okay

915
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,319
i wanted to use guitar synthesizers and

916
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,960
i did not have enough time

917
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,280
i have mac and most of that software is

918
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,960
uh

919
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,280
for windows maybe i am a bad pirate

920
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,440
so i remembered the kazan metal bands

921
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,560
flying sheep

922
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,760
group that had their own rock opera

923
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,920
it's not 80s but people still do rock

924
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,000
operas

925
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,440
and they played this track as they see

926
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,560
it

927
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,839
and i think it went

928
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,240
very well nikita is here so he's he will

929
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,640
be playing it today

930
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,720
we will also have an ii song

931
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,800
sang by

932
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,160
a real person so full collab

933
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:24,889
[Music]

934
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,720
the crying monster was

935
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,839
created by amusement

936
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,520
it creates decent pseudo classics but it

937
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,440
actually uh gets worse very fast so you

938
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,599
need to to tweak and track but it's

939
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:44,800
interesting

940
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,359
so if you don't have you know where to

941
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,359
go if you're stuck

942
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:51,920
then you put it there listen for a

943
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,560
couple hours and choose four texts that

944
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,160
network

945
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,240
but sometimes it's much easier to just

946
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,359
create it

947
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:00,960
jukebox

948
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,839
a huge project

949
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:05,440
generation

950
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,040
that gives you

951
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,359
a waff file

952
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:14,400
you say i want a text like cozy osbourne

953
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,319
with a music from leonard

954
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,599
because the quality is poor there's no

955
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,839
mixing and you just have a wave file

956
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,359
with everything

957
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,839
so this this is not media this is this

958
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:40,960
is something you need to redo replay

959
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,079
from

960
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:43,920
scratch

961
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,720
that singing bot campaign is uh

962
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,480
something that jukebox created

963
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,760
and i think it

964
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,440
ate up my

965
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,480
full

966
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,800
academic limit of

967
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,560
gpu google

968
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,640
cloud it took 12 hours of uh of gpu time

969
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,359
so it's expensive

970
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:08,720
either is a decent thing

971
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,480
if i was doing this from the beginning

972
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,119
right now i would probably go to iva

973
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:16,590
less experiments

974

[Music]

975
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,440
i would give everything to it and cut

976
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,440
all it gives it gives you good

977
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,839
orchestration things

978
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:27,440
and for some

979
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,960
genders

980
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,119
like techno

981
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:33,200
electro music

982
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,319
or pseudo classics

983
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,400
like max richter modern classic

984
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,280
its output is decent it's very good

985
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,480
you can put a midi there

986
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,440
or a wav file to

987
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,079
visualize

988
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,520
it's quite good

989
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,400
we have neural worms it's when i took

990
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,359
the worms mustard

991
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:02,960
track and put it into iowa then sent it

992
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,200
to to ernest

993
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,319
it fixed it a little bit and then we

994
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,560
released it because it's fine it was

995
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,680
really fine

996
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,400
if you need them using some music for an

997
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,640
indie game or a hackathon

998
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,599
and you don't have some budget but you

999
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,240
understand harmonics

1000
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,200
then

1001
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,640
you just you know use a either

1002
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:30,000
one percent of what it gives

1003
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,480
is okay

1004
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,520
maybe genius but you know it's a random

a separate part is generating music

pde and max

1008
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,880
many of you would know about it

1009
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,599
those who like radiohead definitely

1010
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,079
would like it

1011
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,440
for me it was pre-computer triggers

1012
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,599
switchers counters generators

1013
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:05,420
it's very good to create ambient

[Music]

1015
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:17,280
and interactive music something that

1016
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,040
happens in the games i had an idea of

1017
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,119
using it but i did not succeed

1018
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:24,800
there are different

1019
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,200
tools different instruments

1020
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,000
you can add something remove something

1021
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,079
depending on the situation change

1022
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,079
samples

1023
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,440
it's widely used in the games and we

1024
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,400
could

1025
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,200
even use it for standoff

1026
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:53,520
even though i

1027
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,079
i actually done a lot of preparation

1028
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:00,480
work of like 10 hours of decent music

1029
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,280
and i've created classifier that looks

1030
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,440
like

1031
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:09,119
spotify classifier aggressiveness

1032
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,440
dancefulness emotionalness and stuff

1033
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,280
like that so

1034
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,160
this

1035
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,960
is pretty much like what i feel so they

1036
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,359
are already classified and the

1037
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,000
screenshot below is uh

1038
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,440
the issue i

1039
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,760
saw

1040
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,680
many networks like this cannot

1041
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,119
do

1042
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:33,200
decent reading

1043
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,359
here's the bits per minute in the track

1044
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:37,040
so

1045
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:41,040
it sounds okay but you if you try to add

1046
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,440
something or mix it with something it

1047
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,760
all falls apart

1048
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,200
funny enough many

1049
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,520
many neural nets cannot

1050
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,440
do drums

1051
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,520
despite the fact that you know logic

1052
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,680
drama or addictive drum

1053
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:59,920
that is sample based and yes very much

1054
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,000
works well with midi

1055
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
when they generate drums it

1056
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,200
doesn't work so i had to reuse the drums

1057
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,280
in one or two tracks

1058
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,400
just you know pieces

1059
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,280
when everything was finished so during

1060
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,520
may holidays

1061
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,760
i was still high on this

1062
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,319
so i started to

1063
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,800
try to understand what the neural nets

1064
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,200
do in graphics and i created a lot of

1065
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,200
videos

1066
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,440
that is very much like this film

1067
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,119
they can be you know viewed in parallel

1068
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:01,760
if you are in that state of mind but

1069
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,160
some of the tools are very good and you

1070
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,079
can create videos for 15 tracks within a

1071
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:10,319
week

1072
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:12,880
not bad right

1073
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,520
instead of spending 100 000 million for

1074
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,440
something

1075
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,520
you know like you playing the guitar no

1076
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,960
one will be

1077
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,880
watching this

1078
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,920
so here's how the

1079
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,599
cartoons the creator looks

1080
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,760
v100

1081
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,160
and here it goes they're all on youtube

1082
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,960
and as we are true musicians of course

1083
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,160
we need to have vinyl

1084
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,480
so we've published it

1085
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,079
it was uh funny in terms of production

1086
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:56,880
thanks much to michael gardack who has

1087
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,240
created this great

1088
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,880
picture title picture

1089
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,040
that is one head that has become many

1090
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,040
heads and ghosts in the shell

1091
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,280
symbolizing us and it's being sold

1092
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,960
downstairs in case you need it

1093
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,040
there were some

1094
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,240
issues with mastering for binaural

1095
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,200
stuff like that but with that i'd like

1096
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,200
to conclude and if you have any

1097
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,240
questions

1098
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,160
ernest and myself are available to open

1099
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,839
any questions you'd like to ask

1100
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:03,520
okay good thanks thank you it was a very

1101
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,720
interesting presentation on how

1102
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,079
good are the pentesters as musicians

1103
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,079
and currently the world has changed the

1104
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:13,359
ai is

1105
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:16,319
very much inside in the music and

1106
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:18,800
starting from you know sound

1107
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,440
management to guitar processors and

1108
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,839
effects

1109
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
so the first question is

1110
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,119
with the electron electronic music which

1111
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:32,160
is based on patterns and samples

1112
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,480
it's okay but how far

1113
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,359
is

1114
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:38,160
the ai advanced in uh

1115
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,880
genders like blues and jazz

1116
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,400
first question

1117
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,040
second music is interesting because it

1118
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,640
has

1119
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,079
imperfections

1120
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:50,960
you know some micronuances regarding the

1121
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,200
written the dynamics

1122
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,880
that make that music lively and

1123
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,319
interesting so

1124
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:01,440
is there anything in ai about it

1125
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,319
is it emulated

1126
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,119
i think ernest is

1127
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,559
great on the second question and

1128
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,720
he keeps adding some noise but

1129
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,078
then then it gets alive

1130
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,440
on the first question

1131
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,960
just you know register on iva and some

1132
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,440
generous

1133
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,200
are made

1134
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,400
very

1135
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,720
very well there not on the electronic

1136
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,319
ones they've added the network they

1137
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:39,520
the later their model is added the

1138
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:43,680
better it is it trained usually so for

1139
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,839
the

1140
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,119
fantasy music tolkien like it's

1141
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,160
beautiful

1142
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,440
it's super good it creates a stream of

1143
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,599
stuff that i would not be fixing it

1144
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:02,400
i didn't even need to fix anything

1145
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,520
so my feeling

1146
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,960
is that

1147
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,799
soundtrack light

1148
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,599
like

1149
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:11,040
music would be

1150
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,920
done perfectly in five years

1151
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,000
the pop music

1152
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,520
that have their own laws

1153
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:22,720
whose laws are

1154
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:23,839
simpler

1155
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:27,680
it will all be synthetic it's faster

1156
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,960
it's cheaper and you have 100 options

1157
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,280
and the composer will you know build

1158
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,400
the right thing

1159
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,240
and yeah about the imperfections and

1160
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,879
impurities

1161
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:44,799
regarding imperfections and randomness

1162
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,839
electronic music

1163
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:50,240
randomness right

1164
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,520
i think the question was about live

1165
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,680
music when when the band is playing

1166
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,799
there are some impressions that

1167
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:00,880
create

1168
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,880
those things and that is why a human is

1169
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,880
much better at listening to live music

1170
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,280
than you know mechanical one

1171
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,559
so what is done to to create well

1172
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:13,119
there's no issue here ai

1173
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:16,400
is much better at generating random

1174
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,440
things

1175
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,760
so if you talk about some

1176
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,520
you know obeying some law and some

1177
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:25,559
importance and um

1178
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,920
ai is very good at creating some you

1179
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,079
know random sounds

1180
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:37,599
spatial

1181
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:39,520
effects

1182
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,920
but when you talk about rhythmic things

1183
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,400
and musical structural things

1184
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,680
forms

1185
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,400
that is done by a person

1186
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,400
according to

1187
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,200
her

1188
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,119
feelings and

1189
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:54,480
desires

1190
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,720
so i think this is this is

1191
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:59,839
like this and maybe the eye

1192
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:02,480
would even be able to

1193
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,760
to improve this story yeah the person is

1194
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,599
very uh

1195
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:12,280
human is usually very much limited

1196
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:16,400
hello thanks for the presentation and my

1197
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,119
question is

1198
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,079
how

1199
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:23,040
do

1200
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:27,720
the tools affect the

1201
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,559
of an author if i've created this

1202
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:34,880
utility or if someone else created this

1203
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,839
utility or if the musician has

1204
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:41,839
added something and changed something

1205
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,760
as i have been working on the open

1206
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,440
source for quite a while and of course

1207
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,400
i've asked this question

1208
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,480
most of these tools

1209
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,359
are

1210
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:58,559
under some type of license so depending

1211
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,960
on this license

1212
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,400
things

1213
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,480
that have been generated usually it's

1214
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,040
mit or creative commons you just take it

1215
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:11,599
and say i made it using this tool

1216
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:13,359

1217
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:15,520
comply with the intellectual property

1218

1220
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:25,040
for iva if you pay them 30 bucks a month

1221
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,240
you get full copyright

1222
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,440
this story is quite technical

1223
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,160
the other part of the story is uh

1224
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,119
plagiarism and many people who generate

1225
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:41,680
something they say it's generated by the

1226
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,240
neural net but it does not give you any

1227
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,599
guarantee that

1228
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:47,520
you know it's not something it heard

1229
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,839
somewhere

1230
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:50,720
so

1231
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,680
here i did not i do not

1232
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,760
know how to answer this question how do

1233
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,200
i

1234
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,200
avoid this you know

1235
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,559
random

1236
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:02,480
plagiarism

1237
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,160
apart from giving it to 100 people and

1238
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,520
listening to their feedback whether i

1239
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,040
stole it or not

1240
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,359
i don't know

1241
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,960
you know music circles there's some idea

1242
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,160
about this

1243
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:23,680
in music it's not stolen it's quoted

1244
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,119
it's you know

1245
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:27,680
borrowed

1246
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,400
even professional humans are not

1247
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,880
guaranteed from

1248
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,040
quoting someone else they will quote

1249
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,240
someone else because they

1250
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,530
consciously unconsciously they

1251
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:41,760
[Music]

1252
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,880
have

1253
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,599
taken the music that they've heard and

1254
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:48,160
you cannot get rid of your musical

1255
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,319
experience that you have so

1256
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:53,119
it's very hard to you know to define

1257
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:55,839
some absolute authorship

1258
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:57,119
thank you

1259
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:59,490
one more question if i may

1260
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:02,640
[Music]

1261
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,680
can you

1262
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,240
somehow you know

1263
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,359
add the

1264
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:12,720
define the

1265
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,079
harmony or the musical form

1266
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:17,440
beforehand

1267
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,599
so that it only plays within the

1268
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:21,760
boundaries yeah that's that's a cool

1269
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:22,960
idea

1270
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,520
i don't want the programmers to actually

1271
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,359
use it because otherwise then the music

1272
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:30,240
will be generated so with

1273
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,680
do you

1274
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:35,599
approach the patterns for the ai

1275
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:38,640
and algorithms can be improved

1276
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,440
and if you invite

1277
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,480
good musician or a good music

1278
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,480
scholar who knows all those laws of the

1279
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,319
development and

1280
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:52,559
exposition and how this all should

1281
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:55,559
happen

1282
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:01,920
then i think the ai we would be able to

1283
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,000
create something that we would be

1284
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,680
interested in listening for more than a

1285
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,680
minute

1286
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:08,960
that's possible

1287
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:12,079
but in theory i did not see any

1288
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:14,559
practical implementations of such things

1289
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:15,520
and

1290
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,839
even

1291
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
even in media

1292
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,760
so far the humanity is interested in

1293
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,319
other things

1294
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:26,079
actually some

1295
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:31,520
tools allow you to define the harmonics

1296
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,839
and if it gave me something

1297
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:35,839
good

1298
01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:38,640
i cannot develop it like you know

1299
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:39,440
for

1300
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,640
four rounds

1301
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,480
that are cool and i need something else

1302
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,079
so i need some harmonic motion

1303
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:49,599
you can use that part to initialize the

1304
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:51,839
ways

1305
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:54,559
define you know to go to

1306
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,640
parallel minor

1307
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,920
from you know

1308
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:01,599
c major to a minor and

1309
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:03,520
my practical experience says that those

1310
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:08,160
things works like one one out of 100.

1311
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:12,559
so i need to run 100 iterations to

1312
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:15,440
provide something that is good but uh

1313
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,720
yeah all the tools move in that

1314
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:17,760
direction

1315
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,160
maybe one more question i i'm afraid we

1316
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,200
are now using the time of our next

1317
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,200
presenter and this is not something that

1318
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,440
is good

1319
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:28,480
hi

1320
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,720
thanks

1321
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,760
thanks for helping the whole community

1322
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,680
you know to

1323
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:39,359
add some creativity to ph days

1324
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:42,160
and you know the conferences

1325
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,000
is still

1326
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,200
is active for many years so we need to

1327
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,720
somehow evolve

1328
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:52,079
and the question is about the ip rights

1329
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:55,520
we have uh robinson's tale the life is

1330
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,759
short

1331
01:02:57,839 --> 01:02:59,200
which

1332
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:02,079
develops the topic of

1333
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:04,079
art

1334
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:06,000
exploiting

1335
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,400
the all the possible opportunities

1336
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,400
because the next ideas

1337
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:13,760
are less and less likely to be original

1338
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,960
the question is generative part does it

1339
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:20,559
allow to broaden the

1340
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:24,960
space or to only narrow it

1341
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,440
so two points of view i like the you

1342
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:28,319
know

1343
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:31,839
i'm a bit schizophrenic

1344
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,359
it's a great creative tool that is very

1345
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:39,039
good and it's a sin not to use it

1346
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:42,160
for me as an amateur musician it was a

1347
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:44,799
great development i would not be

1348
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:47,599
able to start doing this and i would not

1349
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:49,520
go into that area

1350
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,760
creating 10 tracks

1351
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,640
many tracks were done by a nest

1352
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,720
i would not be able to

1353
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,839
to actually do it now i see the result i

1354
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:02,960
like the result and it's good so

1355
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,760
on the other hand

1356
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,839
when you rely a lot on the

1357
01:04:10,839 --> 01:04:12,640
machine it

1358
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,599
it tries to follow something you know to

1359
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:18,079
to make something perfect it's like in

1360
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:20,559
the disney

1361
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:23,200
disney cartoons with all the faces being

1362
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,160
the same

1363
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,559
because you have feedback of you know

1364
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:28,880
this face is more clickable and everyone

1365
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,559
is trying to

1366
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:33,280
make the faces you know as

1367
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,760
pops style as possible

1368
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,240
same for the neural nets they will just

1369
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:41,839
generate you know same same music that

1370
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:43,520
will satisfy the maximum amount of

1371
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:45,839
people then someone will you know turn

1372
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:48,480
it over and the fashion will change

1373
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:52,160
so that's that's how i look at this

1374
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:55,440
i have a different viewpoint on this my

1375
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,480
internal

1376
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,440
uh creative

1377
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:02,400
viewpoint is that any new melody in the

1378
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,200
current world can not be

1379
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:09,078
a repetition of something

1380
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,720
but another thing is that every new

1381
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,319
melody is a new melody

1382
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:21,359
and let me

1383
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:23,039
tell you why

1384
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:24,400
creativity

1385
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,920
is individual experience is

1386
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,559
and what happens to you is unique in

1387
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:33,760
itself by default it never happened to

1388
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,160
anyone else

1389
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,799

[Music]

1391
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:49,200
during my creative work yeah i

1392
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:52,160
understood that you do need to reinvent

1393
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,319
the wheel even if the wheel has been

1394
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:55,760
invented

1395
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,920
so even if you think that you know

1396
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,359
everything is

1397
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:01,760
created everything is written in the

1398
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:02,799
world

1399
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:05,200
you know this idea kills why would you

1400
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,440
need an idea that kills you need to go

1401
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,400
against that idea you need to forget

1402
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,640
what you have

1403
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:13,440
and

1404
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,359
just just create

1405
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:17,760
everything will be similar to something

1406
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,839
it's impossible not to be

1407
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:22,880
similar to something but your creative

1408
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,440
experience your creative effort is

1409
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,200
individual and

1410
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:30,079
thus i would say that

1411
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:31,440
it is important

1412
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,000
we are in a polar world and

1413
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:34,960
every

1414
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:38,000
everything has you know a dual

1415
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,039
approach duel

1416
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:43,359
it can be

1417
01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:45,359
similar to something but unique in

1418
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:46,799
something

1419
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:49,200
