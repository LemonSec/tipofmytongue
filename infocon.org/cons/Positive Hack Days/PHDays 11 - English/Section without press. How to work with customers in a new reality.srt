1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,720
once once can you hear me great

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,160
uh thank you all uh who've survived

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:10,960
uh

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,519
this session is considered to be closed

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,560
well it's not closed in the sense that

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,960
we're closing the doors and windows but

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,560
we just wouldn't like what's being

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,000
discussed here

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,680
to come out

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,039
on press pages so if any journalists are

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,679
still in the room please leave the room

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,360
if you consider yourself to be an honest

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,719
person

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,640
so all

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,559
and please don't

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,360
spread the news so we're here to

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,280
discuss the opinions i see some people

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,800
from marketing pr

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,680
and say it's them uh whom i'm addressing

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,920
they're all nodding their heads so

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,360
perhaps they agree

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,960
so the idea of this session

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,120
is about the thoughts uh that

24
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,239
i

25
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,559
was touring with uh when we were

26
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,920
preparing uh the phd agenda we're

27
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,960
talking about tectonic shifts but mostly

28
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,960
uh in the sense

29
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,200
that it affects

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,080
the regulators the service providers but

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,040
we don't discuss a lot how it looks from

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,000
the customer viewpoint what's happening

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,840
how in their eyes

34
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,040
the

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,119
information security

36
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,920
concepts get changed so this is what i'd

37
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,759
like to start with so we here have

38
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,320
panelists from companies that deal with

39
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,439
customers directly and so because they

40
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,798
are working with them face to face

41
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,079
talking

42
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,920
one-on-one with number ones and number

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,600
twos of the companies

44
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,759
so let me introduce my co-authors let me

45
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,200
put it this way

46
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,720
romantic ligand from positive

47
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,439
technologies

48
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,799
genius denis andreyevsky expert an

49
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,280
expert put it this way

50
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,520
a person with a rich biography let's put

51
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,040
it this way

52
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,320
dmitry i got a teen cough

53
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,680
so what i would like to learn

54
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,560
about is our joint understanding and

55
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,879
opinion about what's happening so the

56
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,760
words tectonic shift that we heard in

57
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,560
the first keynote discussion uh perhaps

58
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,280
do not reflect the current situation for

59
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,360
everyone it looks different now for you

60
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,120
security people friends how does the

61
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,959
current picture look what do you think

62
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,440
is happening in the country how

63
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,319
bad it is how dangerous it is in your

64
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,519
understanding based on your experience

65
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,720
uh both in your companies and in market

66
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,000
experience

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,120
well for any order will do

68
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,680
i understand you're laughing i am

69
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,400
already waiting for customers who would

70
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,319
say what's happening on their side let

71
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,120
me start look my story is very simple

72
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,720
and very vivid if the past all of us as

73
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,280
industry as experts

74
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,319
were

75
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,879
saying we as a vendor when we're selling

76
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,400
our product

77
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,360
so the guys were saying this to their

78
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,720
top managers when they were building

79
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,760
information security look there's cyber

80
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,280
security there are hackers there are

81
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,599
attackers and it all may lead to

82
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,480
inadmissible uh implications here so you

83
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,319
need to be build protection and the

84
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,799
asset was what is inadmissible these

85
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,599
things don't exist look in the media

86
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,519
it's all quiet nobody's being attacked

87
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,360
our colleagues are not being attacked so

88
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,799
i think

89
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,159
so if

90
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,799
we take a high-level view not even

91
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,440
delving inside so what's changed that no

92
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,920
such questions are being asked anymore

93
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,640
so what uh us and not being attacked

94
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,319
other people not being attacked if a

95
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,959
cyber security and not a

96
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,720
a must so

97
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,159
this thing has passed about attacks that

98
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,879
other people's talk uh because it's uh a

99
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,360
lot of there's a lot of curious things

100
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,920
beneath this top level denis may i ask

101
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,840
you

102
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,360
how does it look from fintech and

103
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,879
banking community

104
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,840
in my understanding what i see

105
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,358
the number of attacks

106
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,798
has grown

107
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,280
uh many times over uh so there's uh some

108
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,840
uh incredible amounts of you know

109
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,240
smoke black noise white noise

110
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,199
i think

111
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,440
the financially motivated hackers are

112
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,520
still financially motivated hackers

113
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,680
those who wanted to earn

114
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,880
some dao

115
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,199
are still there they did not change they

116
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,960
did not

117
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,680
re-focus on espionage but in addition to

118
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,400
this we got a huge amount of

119
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,080
height

120
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,720
of low and to medium skilled hackers

121
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,680
maybe kids of different level of

122
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,759
training not very high level

123
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,800
uh who organize ddos attacks

124
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,400
uh of whom uh there are 20 times more

125
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,800
than in the past and if you

126
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,360
take a look at most ddos attacks they're

127
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,919
quite simple in their structure

128
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,080
they are not really implemented very

129
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,600
smartly

130
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,919
and so you can't see anything new and

131
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,919
novel there

132
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,520
what kind of changes

133
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,199
that could happen in terms of the

134
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,320
government

135
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,120
groups that could attack

136
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,199
the government organizations uh it's

137
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,880
difficult for me to say

138
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,840
but

139
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,840
i saw a publication and they said that

140
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,639
they uh named the level of attack on the

141
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,560
russian uh companies and organizations

142
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,639
critical what does it lead to of course

143
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,400
companies uh who did not do security at

144
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,320
all of course they suffered from these

145
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,600
kids and from this low and medium

146
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,320
skilled level

147
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,280
with those who did

148
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,720
information security financial

149
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,240
organizations

150
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,199
they

151
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,360
had these attacks and had had these

152
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,560
attacks what's become worse

153
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,440
gi and security tools

154
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,880
is going away the international

155
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,199
community is disconnecting from the

156
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,160
russian

157
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,800
federation this imposes a negative trail

158
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,680
on

159
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,240
the developing information security on

160
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,319
its development vector

161
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,880
on the scale level of what we're doing

162
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,400
on the trends

163
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,160
that

164
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,840
exist in information security we're

165
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,319
losing uh some of uh threat intelligence

166
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,360
it's also bad we may not be able to see

167
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,080
uh some threats that may already be

168
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,280
happening all over the world and it's

169
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,960
not good uh it should be

170
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,479
counted

171
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,360
so considering uh that protectiveness

172
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,720
goes down uh the attacks go up my

173
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,400
personal opinion is that information

174
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,199
security in addition to what has been it

175
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,479
has been uh doing so far should revise

176
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,120
its approaches to the organization of uh

177
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,039
security if overlane security tools for

178
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,440
some organizations were okay

179
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,720
but saying overlane uh i mean when the

180
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,680
information security was not talking a

181
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,759
lot with business was not going deeply

182
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,840
into how business was structured it was

183
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,319
just you just installed several anti-aav

184
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,400
solutions and nothing more than that so

185
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
perhaps it's no longer the time for that

186
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,880
if business comes to me saying that i

187
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,800
have a process to work with personal

188
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,880
data so the security person

189
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,759
instead of saying that i have a federal

190
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,840
152 and the order 11

191
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,759
19 of f stack i think 199 is the number

192
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,879
of that order so he should

193
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,039
look back and ask business

194
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,520
can you avoid processing data at all

195
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,319
because if they can avoid the process

196
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,400
that process could be called security by

197
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,039
design of course it's simplistic example

198
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,319
but in the whole i think information

199
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,280
security should restructure uh regroup

200
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,080
in this direction to do it security by

201
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,400
itself and i mean everybody knows that

202
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,440
zero trust security by design security

203
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,080
in depth with all uh the uh different

204
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,160
borders of if the organization had a

205
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,680
firewall at

206
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,520
the perimeter and nothing else then

207
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,319
perhaps this organization is not

208
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,520
doing well with but if the organization

209
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,919
has been doing uh security in depth

210
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,840
including all the different security

211
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,039
components for different business

212
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,080
processes then on the whole they should

213
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,000
be okay okay if they break one of the 10

214
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,958
elements so it's not good but not too

215
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:43,839
bad

216
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:44,800
at least

217
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,320
they can maneuver so security in depth

218
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,120
if

219
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,080
the

220
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,680
company and the information security

221
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,240
people were following these principles

222
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,120
then

223
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,240
they shouldn't get any anything how to

224
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,320
adjust so perhaps

225
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,440
they

226
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,360
this could happen

227
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,279
later on uh unless they

228
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,120
become more serious

229
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,920
so we have these intelligence

230
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,399
incentives to

231
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,080
regroup

232
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,320
meaning that the market need is there

233
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,560
and i hope that

234
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,800
new companies will rise on that and the

235
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,360
existing companies will strengthen based

236
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,320
on that

237
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,519
there are enough of brains in russia

238
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,200
i'll come back a little bit towards

239
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,240
roman said in the beginning

240
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,519
to the effect in the effect that now

241
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,800
the management

242
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,560
uh is no longer able uh to not notice

243
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,760
what's happening in the world of

244
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,279
information security well uh i might say

245
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,200
that they shouldn't have done that in

246
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,959
the past because there were quite a lot

247
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:51,760
of

248
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,680
public cases

249
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,000
but now as we're talking with customers

250
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,040
we indeed see that this story has

251
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,000
received an additional push

252
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,079
generating a lot of interest and on the

253
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,640
same at the same time i

254
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,279
uh observe a parallel trend

255
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,600
that the number of questions

256
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,839
that

257
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,040
has become

258
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,360
of interest to the management

259
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,519
has grown as well i thought information

260
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,440
security is not the only one on the one

261
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,160
hand there is interest but on the other

262
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,120
hand the window of opportunity for you

263
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,600
to bring your ideas

264
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,440
has shrunk

265
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,079
so you know if your business is crashing

266
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,000
if your logistic chains

267
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,480
go down maybe information security is

268
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,640
not something that you would be prepared

269
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,959
you should spend all of your time as

270
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,240
the ceo

271
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,800
so this uh also has to be born in mind

272
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,040
and coming back to the question of how

273
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,120
are we to work with customers

274
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,120
i feel that uh from the point of view

275
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,680
of us as professionals working with

276
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,680
customers

277
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,640
we

278
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,279
see an idea coming on the forefront that

279
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,160
we should take more responsibility

280
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,040
well

281
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,120
the information security you know the

282
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,120
usual way is when we don't guarantee

283
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,399
anymore

284
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,360
and

285
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,839
we can't calculate how much we're going

286
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,399
to lose so i think we should cover these

287
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,600
two questions now

288
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,480
provide more guarantees to customers and

289
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,440
make the information security uh simpler

290
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,200
for a business that's an answer to your

291
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,880
question hey guys

292
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,839
uh i would perhaps like to argue with

293
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,240
dimitri i started with

294
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,240
the top management

295
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,800
but look the first point you made

296
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,200
foreign vendors have left on the one

297
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,519
hand it's not pleasant but look what was

298
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,519
the position if

299
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,560
you

300
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,839
are a good

301
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,600
state enterprise

302
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,560
so please invest

303
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,279
money and return it into the economy

304
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,279
country but not to

305
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,720
you know take it out the country by

306
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,399
paying for inventors if you're a

307
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,920
commercial company well it's up to you

308
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,279
this

309
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,200
thing has always existed in the russian

310
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,839
market and it's always been on the

311
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,519
balance

312
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,680
they left and it's not good because

313
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,440
indeed

314
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,160
some advanced technologies are no longer

315
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,480
available to us we lost

316
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,600
some

317
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,839
easy to use technologies but what has

318
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,680
happened to

319
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,320
counterbalances

320
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,360
see uh security people were wanting her

321
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,360
to cover the infrastructure i mean it's

322
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,959
okay within your organization but there

323
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,800
were a lot of companies that didn't have

324
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,240
either administrative or financial

325
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,279
resource to build uh security covering

326
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,360
all the perimeter all the key systems

327
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,360
and for them it doesn't matter

328
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,800
whether these products would be

329
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,880
forwarding made or domestically

330
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,000
engineered

331
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,920
yes they

332
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,120
started but but now they started

333
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,240
where they

334
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,279
need to

335
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,120
build something to protect

336
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,120
so on the whole

337
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,680
well it happens through pain of course

338
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,800
it's bad

339
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,959
uh but the effect is there on the

340
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,720
technology level and and on the

341
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,959
technology level i think uh it's more

342
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,279
positive and you get into critical

343
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,279
infrastructure

344
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,240
uh

345
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,320
as a matter of principle even for myself

346
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,839
as a person with experience in the

347
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,360
international market you know i've

348
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,760
always

349
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,480
voted for best practices wherever they

350
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,720
come from so my

351
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,279
philosophy is such that for certain

352
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,959
industries for certain

353
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,680
technology components it would be wiser

354
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,680
to use domestically

355
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,760
developed solutions

356
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,680
even

357
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,360
at

358
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,440
not talking about them uh being not so

359
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,120
user-friendly well colleagues i listen

360
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,839
to you and i was surprised by one thing

361
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,240
a gap in

362
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,079
the perception

363
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,000
you both said

364
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,079
that the news background and what's

365
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,440
happening is indeed

366
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,320
exerting pressure on the company leaders

367
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,760
there really knew that something is

368
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,920
happening in cyber security and on this

369
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,440
waves wave

370
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,120
security people

371
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,720
get an opportunity to have something

372
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,720
installed in their organization and here

373
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,880
i think that if a security person is

374
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,959
going to use this wave well i mean to

375
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,839
say i uh also exploit this wave and it

376
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,720
must be exploit exploited but

377
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,800
if they had not had dialogue with the

378
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,360
top managers uh before that this wave

379
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,920
will go away that's important yes uh so

380
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,279
uh the first failure and they say okay

381
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,600
good go away

382
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,839
i agree

383
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,360
uh what to do

384
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,720
that this dynamic should go away

385
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,199
well you know i mean everybody can

386
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,279
hear what they want

387
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,760
but what's the difference you're saying

388
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,560
the top managers have seen information

389
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,800
they use no they have found themselves

390
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,959
in the room where they had to make

391
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,600
decisions regarding cyber security

392
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,040
saving their business

393
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,199
as to the news yes they started to read

394
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,720
something more but what's radically

395
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,920
changes crisis committees and business

396
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,639
continuity committees uh rarely

397
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,480
intervenes in cyber security but in

398
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,199
these past few months several companies

399
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,360
have gone uh through the story of

400
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,000
creating uh crisis committees but i

401
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,160
still believe that the situation uh is

402
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,720
uh very bad had the dialogue not

403
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,199
been in place before that

404
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,639
it's not good

405
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,360
so

406
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,120
you what you have to do

407
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,839
is to build a regular dialogue with top

408
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,920
management so that they

409
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,199
could have an opportunity uh to make

410
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,079
decisions on information security so you

411
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,240
need to be able to speak to them

412
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,839
in the right language using the right

413
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:58,800
language

414
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,040
so had it not been

415
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,600
there before that this is a good

416
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,320
opportunity to start this dialogue

417
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,120
well we have a stop world called uh

418
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,240
decree

419
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,160
a lot has been said about it today

420
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,320
yesterday

421
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,320
we heard it in the keynote session from

422
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,240
the ministry of digital development uh

423
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,240
is perceived not so much as a carrot but

424
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,399
rather as a stick and

425
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,560
we

426
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,120
are interested in how companies are

427
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,199
going to feel uh in sprint

428
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,560
you know compliance is quite a bad story

429
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,040
uh it doesn't sell well uh with

430
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,199
customers it has

431
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,839
its clear restriction clear limit

432
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,079
connected to what we need to do as a

433
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,480
minimum so that the regulator should not

434
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,320
create make problems for us in the

435
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,639
future what dimitri has said is a very

436
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,440
important story because it defines who

437
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,680
is the decision-making person

438
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,920
for the ways of development of

439
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,279
information security in this

440
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,520
organization it's easy for dmitry to

441
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,679
talk because he's vice president and

442
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,720
he's in contact with number one and he

443
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,760
can

444
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,959
do

445
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,160
wage direct dialogue with a ceo which in

446
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,799
russian means that he

447
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,000
can get

448
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,319
what he needs if

449
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:27,280
you uh are linked to physical security

450
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,280
or

451
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,520
other types of security

452
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,480
you'll be proxied by a person whose life

453
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,240
experience is not

454
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,080
relevant

455
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,760
and as a rule

456
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,000
your concerns will never get to number

457
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,039
one

458
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,320
because the top manager

459
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,200
they

460
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,480
usually have a legal education

461
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,840
and they make decisions that they

462
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,799
will decide

463
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,400
based on their experience so there's a

464
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,480
gap between the cyber risk of the

465
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,600
organization

466
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,679
and

467
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,200
the

468
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,960
subject matter uh

469
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,120
that's typical of information security

470
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,360
also what i'd like to say

471
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,720
that we suddenly gotten new

472
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,679
opportunities a window of opportunities

473
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,600
but it looks uh that currently in the

474
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,720
moment

475
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,799
we have ourselves with a lot of contacts

476
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,080
where a lot

477
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,559
of information security tools that we've

478
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,640
chosen as best in the market or best in

479
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,200
terms of performance suddenly uh turned

480
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,559
into a pumpkin

481
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,720
and basically

482
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,039
you started getting information about

483
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,559
events

484
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,360
lost the opportunity to analyze them uh

485
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,799
there's a whole class of systems uh that

486
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,440
don't really exist in the russian market

487
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,039
and even if you if you uh you know

488
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,600
allocate a budget and identity and

489
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,320
allocate resources uh

490
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,760
it there will be

491
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,039
several months

492
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,080
of

493
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,200
gap

494
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,320
for you to start getting this

495
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,360
information the digital uh

496
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,320
sovereignty has not yet happened however

497
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,840
much we

498
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,559
were discussing about it

499
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,559
at another level

500
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,120
not at the level of cpu of

501
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,000
operating system so nobody has taken

502
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,880
away the problem with undocumented

503
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,799
capabilities

504
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,840
and when they get statistic

505
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,360
it's mostly about web ddos fishing

506
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,000
but as a rule this is just a background

507
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,640
for more serious attacks uh this takes

508
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,360
the time of the security resources

509
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,320
but against this background uh serious

510
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,679
scenario based attacks uh are waged with

511
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,360
novel

512
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,720
attack vectors

513
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,240
so i have a feeling

514
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,919
it's just

515
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,120
like

516
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,240
at the moment

517
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,120
where a parasitist

518
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,400
uh

519
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,039
jumps from the airplane i have a feeling

520
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,960
that in the very near future

521
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,520
we can run into serious problems which

522
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,080
just haven't yet arrived certain things

523
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,120
could happen

524
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,039
so invisible attacks that sooner or

525
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,600
later yes because uh they don't

526
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,000
necessarily have immediate impact it all

527
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,840
depends on their goal

528
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,280
you know

529
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,919
as a moderator i'll try to

530
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,600
move closer to you

531
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,679
and you know what's cool usually when

532
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,360
you're entering a discussion

533
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,799
anywhere you're sitting and uh think uh

534
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,360
about ndas uh what you can't speak about

535
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,360
what's not uh and now it's become so

536
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,720
simple

537
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,120
uh well i heard from you roman

538
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,280
that everybody started thinking uh what

539
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,400
to do and start doing well i agree with

540
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,280
thinking but not about doing

541
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,799
so math media were ddosed for a week or

542
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,600
so

543
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,440
math media were not doing anything and

544
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,559
then it did something okay three weeks

545
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,960
passed and airlines started to be

546
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,520
deducted and for some uh reason uh

547
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,240
successfully so i mean it looks like

548
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,799
airlines uh were watching uh mass media

549
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,679
being ddosed and uh

550
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,600
why should they come to us and now they

551
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,679
say oh what do we do we're selling

552
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,159
tickets uh-huh that's perhaps uh what

553
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,240
happened to us so you know the story is

554
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,400
like

555
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,840
that that some triggers have worked in

556
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,600
people's heads is only relevant for 10

557
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,760
to 15 percent of customers

558
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,320
so the national idea of the russian as

559
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,679
the saying says is until uh the uh

560
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,799
thunderbolt strucks uh the uh the

561
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,080
peasants

562
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,280
put across against his head so

563
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,360
we have started attacked at attackers

564
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,799
and uh we need to do uh ddos sock

565
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,559
run a pen test

566
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,039
in a day okay a day is too short let's

567
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,880
do it in three days okay an important

568
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,480
point

569
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,760
i didn't didn't say in which sequence

570
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,880
they started to do it yes ideally it

571
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,240
looks like this

572
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,400
but in real life it all happens just

573
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,520
like you said

574
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,679
the problem is that the coverage is now

575
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,720
complete so

576
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,559
everybody all industries are under

577
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,280
attack and very different companies from

578
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,159
small to large so my point was not so

579
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,679
much uh about the reason why uh they

580
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,760
have paid attention uh but about the

581
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,039
result so uh so they understand that

582
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,320
sooner or later it will reach you as

583
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,200
well so you need to do security

584
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,039
yes in fact you're saying

585
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,440
that it started happening but i remember

586
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,360
about five years ago you know in the

587
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,480
past

588
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,679
uh when we had this apt wave i was

589
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,000
uh visiting different banks and was

590
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,280
responding to incidents and like 24

591
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,158
hours of responsing

592
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,080
that was

593
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,440
the first time i understood i was

594
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,880
getting old i

595
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,480
went to sleep

596
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,080
at the computer

597
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,880
so

598
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,360
we uh cleaned the system drove the

599
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,760
hackers away uh stopped the incidents

600
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,159
the acute phase of the incident we were

601
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,480
going to leave and then be called by a

602
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,640
head of this organization i said dimitry

603
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,559
can you stay a bit uh until everything

604
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,960
is fixed so that it shouldn't get to

605
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,120
there once again first i wanted to swear

606
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,880
and then

607
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,400
gradually uh i exhaled and said you need

608
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,440
at least

609
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,000
three or four years to work intensively

610
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,039
to remove this

611
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,600
to remove the reasons that could lead to

612
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,400
this

613
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,240
and indeed so the guy didn't have

614
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,640
understanding number one don't have the

615
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,559
understanding that security cannot be

616
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,440
switched by a button and quite often

617
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,080
they really have expectations okay

618
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,400
why don't you spend another day or two

619
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,679
but make it

620
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,000
secure

621
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,240
okay

622
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,240
i would uh focus uh your

623
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,120
uh

624
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,919
point when you're saying that until the

625
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,039
thunderbolt strikes uh a

626
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,360
uh presence uh will not put across on

627
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,559
his forehead

628
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,840
uh you shouldn't

629
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,080
miss

630
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,600
guide your

631
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,918
customers or everyone says indeed

632
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,520
the market

633
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,600
has people who has done security of

634
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,000
those who haven't done security and

635
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,240
those who haven't done it now may

636
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,559
be i may start doing that

637
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,480
and here we

638
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,440
have to deal with the

639
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,720
subjective

640
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,080
uh vision of a person working in the

641
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,760
security organization

642
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,440
vis-a-vis their

643
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,159
manager the top manager it all depends

644
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,400
on their character it all depends on

645
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,360
their relationship if in some industry

646
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,279
it doesn't matter which one

647
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,679
ddos attacks are happening and in the

648
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,600
adjacent industry

649
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,640
you could

650
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,799
think that

651
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,360
it wouldn't happen to them so if people

652
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,600
don't expect these things to happen well

653
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,840
perhaps it's not going to change until

654
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,080
something really critical happens or

655
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,039
until

656
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,600
some revolution happens because you know

657
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,000
everybody knows that antivirus virus is

658
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,039
needed

659
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,120
on working computers not everyone okay

660
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,039
practically everyone everybody heard

661
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,640
about that

662
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,960
well i wouldn't agree i think most

663
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,880
statistically most people understand

664
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,720
that even

665
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,320
my home computer needs an antiviral

666
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,440
virus

667
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,640
so perhaps some more progressive

668
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,520
approaches will evolutionary uh reach

669
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,320
that but that will happen

670
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,360
well i think the av story uh is

671
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,760
actually a different story it's actually

672
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,840
a story about kaspersky

673
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,240
they spoke so much about themselves

674
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,360
that people started to think

675
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,600
it's not because you need to be secured

676
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,679
but you can't do without these guys so

677
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,360
actually it was part of brand building

678
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,600
from kaspersky and basically something

679
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,880
like that can be reproduced in other

680
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,880
areas colleagues let's continue

681
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,679
i

682
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,919
am imposing it my own psychology you

683
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,840
know i discuss with someone and the

684
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,080
feelings i've had over the past two or

685
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,480
three years is that either i'm in

686
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,919
inception or in matrix movies uh so a

687
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,679
week starts and it ends and you

688
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,000
think that it can't get worse and then

689
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,440
you know there's a knock on the door

690
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,120
life brings new surprises in different

691
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,239
aspects somebody uh

692
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,799
well did you expect the pandemic in 2020

693
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,360
did anybody expect

694
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,720
what happened on 24th of february

695
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,120
i've already mentioned this joke in the

696
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,559
keynote session

697
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,320
almost every day you know all about

698
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,840
every day

699
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,880
i

700
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,559
get a call like that hey guys strengthen

701
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,240
security

702
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,840
why there's information that tomorrow an

703
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,799
unprecedented attack will happen across

704
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,960
the entire territory of russia and way

705
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,559
to get this information

706
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,760
from is from secrets hacker telegram

707
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,880
channels

708
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,600
you know these secret telegram channels

709
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,240
uh i think are now being read by all

710
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,480
managers

711
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,919
whether they

712
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,360
subscribe to them or not but they're

713
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,600
there and then

714
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,480
we

715
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,200
see anonymous says who will say that by

716
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,600
the end of this week all atms will

717
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,120
become empty

718
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,679
uh there's a cybersec channel

719
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,679
that makes very strong statements by the

720
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,159
end of this week the nuclear industry of

721
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,760
russia will stall

722
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,880
we've got access to uh the entire energy

723
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,360
system and far east will be blacked out

724
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,159
and

725
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,480
you get upset

726
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,559
if you get uh and then it doesn't happen

727
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,880
so my personal feeling is that the

728
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,840
audience is becoming to get tired

729
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,880
and

730
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,840
the

731
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,760
uh they start stop believing that

732
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,520
security breaches may become critical

733
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,360
for their organizations how does it look

734
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,279
from your side from your perspective

735
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,919
yourself to talking to

736
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,159
your managers your top managers your

737
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,200
customers

738
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,039
do they believe in information security

739
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,679
the important thing is not to try uh to

740
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,679
deliver this information to the top ones

741
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,080
well we don't they read themselves well

742
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,919
if they've read something i'll let them

743
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,080
come to an expert and ask if they ask me

744
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,799
you know they do ask me periodically

745
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,399
i'm not going to give any names

746
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,240
yesterday i was asked dimitri can you

747
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,240
well there's so there's data from yeah

748
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,399
uh i looked there's my data there so

749
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,600
delete it please

750
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,440
i said i can't do that

751
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,200
i'm explaining how that basically

752
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
they're out in the world

753
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,520
but i'll i explained then that is

754
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,440
basically a hype do you understand that

755
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,880
your data

756
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,840
not

757
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,360
in the same volume

758
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,480
but

759
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,840
what would you just see

760
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,240
but you know many times over uh spread

761
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,399
across the internet i can find for you

762
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,480
you'll be surprised how many exciting

763
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,399
things can be found about you where you

764
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,600
park your car how you move what you eat

765
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,000
who you meet and so on and so forth and

766
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,919
this breaking point why does it happen

767
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,080
it's because of this hype the people

768
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,000
need to be explained

769
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,679
all this

770
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,520
has been in existence and it still

771
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,520
exists it's just that the information

772
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,240
background has changed in the past we

773
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,960
had a focus on leakages leakages from

774
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,360
banks maybe uh half a year or maybe a

775
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,559
whole year

776
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,559
all the news so media were talking about

777
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,880
that now they switched to hacker attacks

778
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,520
of these anonymouses

779
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,000
but i think that adequate people would

780
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,760
hardly respond to that

781
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,720
they don't read telegram channels

782
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,320
okay there's an alternative point of

783
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,880
view

784
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,159
do all

785
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,600
business

786
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,720
uh managers get under the influence of

787
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,919
this news

788
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,679
uh background well it usually happens

789
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:18,640
that

790
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,520
the

791
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,720
manager sends you a an article

792
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,279
uh and ask you to comment

793
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,600
if it's a small bank manager than the

794
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,720
ask details i would like uh to say

795
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,840
something in

796
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,840
roman's favor uh we were discussing risk

797
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,080
management and the sidelines and i think

798
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,000
the story here is that the function of

799
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,600
information security

800
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,080
should one way or the other

801
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:44,960
get

802
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,000
in

803
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
to become part of

804
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,240
operational risk management company

805
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,159
because at the enterprise level

806
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,679
cyber risks

807
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,000
are not considered seriously

808
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,039
but

809
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,760
operating or operation risk

810
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,679
are certainly considered positive

811
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,399
technologies uh offered a new approach a

812
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,000
platform

813
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,039
yeah yeah and roman perhaps

814
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,919
the main speaker who was explaining

815
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:12,799
how

816
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,200
you can do a prediction forecast i

817
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,279
already i'm really so i

818
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,440
just said i was

819
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,039
uh giving uh

820
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,640
baton to you

821
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,320
well uh it's not going to happen

822
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,240
actually i'll come back

823
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,960
to uh the discussion about these calls

824
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,720
from the mentioned this information what

825
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,519
do we need to do look

826
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,720
in the first period first days and weeks

827
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,799
and later what our company

828
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,000
facing

829
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,519
a crisis a cyber crisis they had uh

830
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,159
problem problems in their operation uh

831
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,000
caused by cyber attacks it is an

832
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
exercise everybody knows

833
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,760
which by the way

834
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,880
is

835
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,240
uh practiced even uh poorer and less

836
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,559
frequently than

837
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:01,679
business

838
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,679
continuity

839
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,240
so it's an escalation then security

840
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,159
exercises it's about business continues

841
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,360
here

842
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,480
so you

843
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,880
what happens uh there are important

844
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,480
landmarks to

845
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,279
convene uh the crisis community i.t

846
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,840
information security

847
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,399
er and hr

848
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,080
so they need to understand uh what's

849
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,159
working what's not what has suffered

850
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,360
people customers equipment life and they

851
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,840
start making certain steps considering

852
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,480
the situation where we are so people who

853
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,240
have heard

854
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,519
it and

855
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,399
are already panicking they can be

856
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,559
told okay uh you can strengthen the

857
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,159
security but you convene within the

858
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,159
organization and work through your own

859
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,080
internal communication should it happen

860
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,720
tomorrow like your attack tomorrow and

861
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,039
you're out on a vacation well it's not

862
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,399
funny it's indeed it was one of the

863
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,080
practices but then it was somehow sent

864
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,080
to our customers and partners as a list

865
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:00,880
of

866
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,919
steps to make then there were

867
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,480
technical components

868
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,679
i t i s forensics perimeter that were

869
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,159
the actions to be made momentarily and

870
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,519
here at the end of the day we were

871
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,600
taking this acute pain

872
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,320
of

873
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,559
the customer you did the same and we did

874
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,080
the same helping other organizations but

875
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,880
once the acuteness was going down then

876
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,799
another important question

877
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,760
was coming up on what next and then as

878
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,440
dmitry

879
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,720
said

880
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,760
so

881
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,799
can you hear me for the next three years

882
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,200
we have also seen uh things like that

883
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,679
but being a vendor uh we did not quench

884
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,200
this desire but we uh would say

885
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,799
something like this okay

886
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,600
uh you have now felt the brunt you have

887
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,519
now understood what's inadmissible in

888
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,919
your company you've really seen that

889
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,120
people

890
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,799
have started to

891
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,880
do differently now it's become clear

892
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,480
what's inadmissible

893
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,279
the site is down of the process

894
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:06,240
installing and things like that the data

895
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,560
is out there and now we're saying let's

896
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,960
build correct potential uh protection

897
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,199
after that

898
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,800
i hope uh

899
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,359
we'll have enough power

900
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,320
to

901
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,159
for the process to come to an end

902
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,440
well look roman

903
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,159
you are talking about the situation when

904
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,560
the customer faces a problem

905
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,159
but my question was different

906
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,079
some customers haven't met any problems

907
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,320
yet

908
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,159
and

909
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,839
who was broken

910
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,879
for example a metal producer the

911
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,879
e-commerce

912
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,399
companies

913
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,359
portals

914
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,800
nothing bad happened no

915
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,760
power company

916
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,720
the site was broken but electricity is

917
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,920
here

918
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,560
root tube failed what about routine what

919
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,440
is through tube it's nothing of course

920
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,599
you can

921
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,599
disconnect the site but you cannot

922
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,040
disconnect an

923
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,599
airplane

924
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:26,720
and

925
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,079
people

926
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,400
do not believe that

927
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,839
attacks uh can be really dangerous how

928
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,760
can we

929
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,560
tell

930
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,280
your manager that

931
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,040
invisible attacks

932
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,280
are dangerous you cannot touch them and

933
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,480
feel them

934
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,079
you cannot see them and but they happen

935
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,440
i agree it's very difficult to explain

936
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,400
you cannot touch it

937
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,839
that's why we have the hardware here

938
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,280
if

939
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,520
there is a probability

940
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,800
then

941
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,760
you have to do the retrospective

942
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,560
analysis

943
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,879
pen

944
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:25,359
that was shown to the top manager

945
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,200
and

946
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,960
they said that scada segmentation

947
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,160
physical

948
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,920
and any everything else

949
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,079
can be done

950
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,839
at the stage when

951
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,119
we

952
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,880
invited two persons and for three days

953
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,960
uh from the internet they went into the

954
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,440
scada system

955
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,839
and they said that they can penetrate

956
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:59,680
into the enterprise and stop the main

957
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,839
business processes

958
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,760
then it worked

959
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,079
because the main thing was not to press

960
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,720
anything and damage anything but just to

961
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,200
demonstrate that we can do it now

962
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,400
if you show that to the production

963
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,720
people

964
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,599
and show it to the top manager he said

965
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,200
well this scenario should become

966
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,720
unacceptable and impossible

967
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,400
pin tests are carried out

968
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,200
to

969
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,920
demonstrate to the top manager that we

970
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,359
cannot be broken but the real

971
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:43,040
uh target is what kind of attacks

972
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,880
can be taken and what

973
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,440
might the impact be

974
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,400
for example on friday night when

975
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,440
everyone is out of the office

976
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,320
then

977
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,160
what may happen

978
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,839
and the hacker will cho will choose the

979
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,760
the most

980
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,880
unacceptable hour the most inconvenient

981
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,920
hour to attack

982
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,680
at the fourth or five fifth pin test you

983
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,160
say that you are

984
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,720
protected your domain

985
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,079
is not

986
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,280
broken

987
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,119
it's all right but

988
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,880
that's about uh test four at test five

989
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,839
when you have test one then

990
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,760
uh the

991
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,680
result is

992
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,800
quite bad because everything is broken

993
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,960
everything is protected nothing is

994
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,000
properly controlled and so on

995
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,359
and the people who do the pen test first

996
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,960
disclose the important

997
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,359
gaps and vulnerabilities and exploits

998
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:58,000
they see the gaps where

999
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,160
there are no policies there are no

1000
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,240
controls

1001
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,079
then they get to

1002
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,920
the people who have a lot of bridges and

1003
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,000
super

1004
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,760
administrator

1005
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,640
rights access rights yes

1006
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:21,440
but that is from our old life

1007
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,000
that's right

1008
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,119
this is all good but why those people

1009
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,200
who attack us

1010
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,640
every day

1011
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,240
why didn't they do what you say before

1012
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,960
because of the low level of corporate

1013
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,160
culture even if an incident happens the

1014
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,680
enterprise

1015
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,160
tries to conceal it

1016
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,120
and never admit it

1017
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,880
[Music]

1018
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,760
and now all those people

1019
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,720
publish everything

1020
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,520
but

1021
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,400
sometimes they're fakes

1022
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,200
anonymous said they broke here and there

1023
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,799
but no one confirmed

1024
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,000
there was no

1025
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,280
great

1026
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,839
impetus

1027
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,119
i am going to continue about pin tests i

1028
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,040
fully agree with you

1029
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,440
the only thing is that the most

1030
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,280
efficient story

1031
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,319
is

1032
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:23,760
pin testing

1033
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,119
social

1034
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,240
media

1035
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,800
because it's very

1036
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,680
easy to explain to a non-technical

1037
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,119
person

1038
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,160
when you have a story a detective story

1039
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,078
without technical details

1040
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,400
why nothing bad happened yet

1041
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,800
this is not a big problem because a lot

1042
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,400
of things have already happened

1043
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,440
you

1044
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,920
can have a lot of examples in different

1045
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,920
industries

1046
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,440
i mean my opinion about what you asked

1047
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,359
for

1048
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,920
so there is a lot of hype and so on so

1049
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,040
forth

1050
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,160
i think that people who

1051
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,359
monitor

1052
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,680
the real situation

1053
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,520
the trends

1054
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,200
and the tendencies they believe that

1055
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,400
the situation may

1056
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,760
deteriorate to such

1057
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,240
an extent that any

1058
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,960
cases any tools

1059
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,960
can be used

1060
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,520
including

1061
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,400
events that can lead to catastrophic

1062
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,359
consequences

1063
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,240
if the situation deteriorates we shall

1064
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,240
see such attacks

1065
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,799
of course

1066
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,720
i would

1067
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,599
put it differently

1068
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:52,880
talking

1069
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,599
through attacks

1070
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,800
doesn't no let's put it differently

1071
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,720
i think we have to

1072
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,160
display a more systematic approach

1073
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,480
we have to talk about data security and

1074
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,200
allow the top manager to

1075
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,480
improve

1076
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,680
data security

1077
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,040
taking into account real attacks that

1078
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,359
have happened

1079
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,520
supply chain attack

1080
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,480
library attacks fishing

1081
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,200
perimeter breakthroughs

1082
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,599
this is

1083
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,839
something that doesn't work

1084
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,000
they said well

1085
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,560
so every day we have some kind of attack

1086
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,160
there is no panic

1087
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,839
we have such attacks everything is all

1088
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:46,160
right top management needs a more

1089
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,920
systematic approach to data security

1090
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,160
and then sales

1091
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,560
how to work with the customer

1092
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,920
later

1093
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,000
we have different customers who have

1094
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,680
different buyers in the customer company

1095
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,280
one thing is token taking to cfo the

1096
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,280
other is chr

1097
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,359
the other is sales

1098
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,880
it's important to talk to

1099
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,599
where if you talk to cto

1100
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,480
then you have to talk about availability

1101
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,880
if it's this is ceo

1102
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,599
you have to show economic feasibility

1103
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,599
and efficiency of

1104
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,119
your security

1105
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,920
uh solution please don't

1106
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,359
frighten him don't try to scare him with

1107
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:34,720
fishing

1108
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,160
he said no i don't believe you

1109
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,480
no no don't scare anyone

1110
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,000
with fishing

1111
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,880
i talked about how to begin

1112
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,280
negotiations uh

1113
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,400
if you

1114
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,280
if there is no talk you have to involve

1115
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,839
the person

1116
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:56,960
to stir up some kind of emotion to make

1117
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,920
people want to talk to you

1118
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,040
a few days ago

1119
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,400
someone said that i'm talking in terms

1120
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,760
of

1121
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:12,000
large-scale cooperation security but the

1122
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,760
world is much

1123
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,040
wider

1124
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,480
and now i see the same dmitry is talking

1125
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,040
about the processes

1126
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,880
he has the right to

1127
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,000
configure the process

1128
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,319
in the right way you have resources you

1129
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:33,680
have expertise

1130
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,560
you you know business tasks business

1131
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,079
requirements

1132
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,640
what about the companies who have no

1133
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,960
security people who have

1134
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,200
no security at all

1135
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,119
they have to

1136
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,079
they have

1137
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,880
50 of them is open source it has nothing

1138
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,440
in that case the company comes

1139
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,720
to us for a service

1140
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,079
it says that your open source looks like

1141
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,280
that

1142
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,800
yes

1143
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,839
this

1144
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:08,000
proposal

1145
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,079
to cfo ceo cto can

1146
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:14,160
are different and they

1147
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,040
can include not only attacks

1148
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,359
and their possible impact

1149
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:20,160
but

1150
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,960
the the people who are decision makers

1151
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,839
and you can help him take decisions

1152
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,480
three options for example or install

1153
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,200
this and it will cost you a million if

1154
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,280
you do something lower it may be 500 000

1155
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,319
and we can do it at 10 000 but in that

1156
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,640
case you will have this and that and you

1157
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,800
wouldn't have that yet at a certain

1158
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,400
event i heard reports about insurance of

1159
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,000
cyber risks

1160
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,960
and this is a story that we cannot

1161
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,160
launch

1162
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,359
for the last for the last few years we

1163
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:58,480
have insurance company and somebody has

1164
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,200
already insured something and the

1165
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,599
program is clear but it doesn't

1166
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,599
work properly

1167
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,760
we have four

1168
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,920
options

1169
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,640
of risk management insurance is one of

1170
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,200
the four and perhaps we have to pay

1171
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,599
attention to it because it's

1172
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,640
more understandable to business

1173
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,560
departments and it's more interesting

1174
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,799
than

1175
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:33,889
[Music]

1176
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,280
in

1177
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,280
detail

1178
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,000
of course we have to take into account

1179
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,200
force mature because uh companies some

1180
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,359
attacks can be disregarded as force

1181
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:52,800
majora where insurance doesn't work

1182
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,839
it's just it's a common

1183
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:58,880
dima operates within an optimal

1184
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,640
operating

1185
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,879
structure but we had a

1186
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,040
custom a vendor who

1187
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,560
tried to explain to our ceo

1188
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,400
what is shock soc

1189
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,760
why

1190
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,119
talking

1191
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,920
he they didn't mention reflection

1192
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,920
contexts

1193
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,599
red hunting

1194
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:31,359
never just soc it's typical just because

1195
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,000
the

1196
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,400
top manager business didn't have

1197
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,079
relevant experience if you talk to

1198
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,200
the top manager

1199
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,119
in the language the top manager

1200
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:46,480
understands

1201
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,839
the business language

1202
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,559
these are the risks you have to manage

1203
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,880
risks and to manage risk you have such

1204
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,680
and such tools and levers

1205
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,359
we often

1206
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:03,760
bring in historical archive solutions

1207
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,410
physical security

1208
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:08,400
[Music]

1209
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,920
physical security data security the what

1210
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,319
is common there the word security and

1211
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:15,680
nothing else

1212
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:20,480
scenarios risks are quite different

1213
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,240
and

1214
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,040
we have to

1215
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:30,079
be able to talk to cfo ceo cto

1216
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:31,760
and talk to them

1217
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,400
as an independent agency

1218
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:39,200
with its own budget with its own face

1219
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,240
i saw that

1220
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,200
we

1221
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,240
launched projects expertise

1222
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,680
processes

1223
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:52,400
in that case if you are not constrained

1224
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,599
by some other layers until with that you

1225
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,680
have to penetrate until you reach the

1226
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,040
target

1227
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,440
i have a picture

1228
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,720
if

1229
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,440
inside the company if the company never

1230
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,559
dealt with security before

1231
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,520
this is the good time to start

1232
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,599
we have a good reason to do that if the

1233
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,880
company dealt with security then

1234
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,880
we have to explain what is new what is

1235
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,000
happening now

1236
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,040
what is

1237
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,800
happening

1238
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,359
in the telegram channels of the

1239
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:38,240
attacking party

1240
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,040
so

1241
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,520
there is no

1242
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:46,000
apocalypse in general nothing much

1243
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,920
happened we

1244
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,920
protected we do protect now

1245
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,599
yes to explain why now we

1246
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,599
have the new situation do we have to

1247
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:00,559
exploit fear

1248
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,280
do we need a different psychological

1249
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,720
approach

1250
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,640
we deal with

1251
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,760
the army not because you want to

1252
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,880
start a war but you think about

1253
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:17,830
potential

1254
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:19,200
[Music]

1255
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,359
impact

1256
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:22,400
yes

1257
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,200
the probability of risks

1258
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,040
is higher now

1259
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,440
that is the point

1260
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,240
now talking about risks

1261
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,760
and cyber

1262
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,240
stability

1263
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,760
this story like bcm

1264
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,119
often was somewhere at the background

1265
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:44,720
but it's time

1266
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,520
to deal with it now

1267
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:51,359
cyber security cyber stability and we

1268
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,040
have to do it

1269
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,200
is the right way from the very beginning

1270
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,000
not just to buy a new server but

1271
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,720
let's look at the stability of the

1272
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,599
company in different situation yes we

1273
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:08,359
were talking about social stability

1274
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,640
we have to explain

1275
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,160
to the top management what is really

1276
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,240
happening

1277
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,319
why the situation is dangerous now

1278
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:22,400
why some people are nervous

1279
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,520
others are not but at this point i would

1280
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,400
like to thank all the panelists and all

1281
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,000
the

1282
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,119
listeners who are coming to an end

1283
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:37,079
thank you goodbye
