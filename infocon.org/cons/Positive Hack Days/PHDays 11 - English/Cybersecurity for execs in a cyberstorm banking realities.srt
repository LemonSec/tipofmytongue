1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,920
in recent months cyber attacks have

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,839
covered almost all the industries of

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,880
russian economy all types of companies

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,920
and

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,920
who is the key entity in the company who

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,079
makes decisions about how can we build

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,480
defense naturally speaking it's a top

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,080
manager

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,240
so what is cyber security for top

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,039
managers in such an important segment as

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,960
banking industry we're going to speak

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,960
about it together with pablo climo which

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,760
independent expert father hello hello

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,079
and roman chaplin director of the

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,520
direction

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,200
of business consulting from positive

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,920
technologies hello roma hi

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,040
okay let's see after february 24 we have

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,520
changed a lot of things

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,120
and in any organization

21
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,840
activities are much wider than

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,760
exploitation of digital solutions so

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,960
let's speak about business operations in

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,440
recent months what has changed in the

25
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,120
scale of activities of the company let's

26
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,080
begin with that okay definitely

27
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,880
changes did happen and big number of

28
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,640
changes happened in production companies

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,040
therefore violations of

30
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,119
supply chains

31
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,920
departure of certain sales markets

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,479
questions of replacements

33
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,880
and in the banking sphere

34
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,720
we may be less

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,080
likely changes are happening as well

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,520
undoubtedly less

37
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,439
because we need a certain period to

38
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,400
understand which changes are happening

39
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,640
and where is this bottom where these

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,040
changes are happening how does it affect

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,479
banking business process first of all

42
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,119
changes have tackled

43
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,920
communication channels uh control over

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,079
these communication channels problems

45
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,479
related with possible penetration

46
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,759
inside of the banking network and of

47
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,759
course the story with pandemics

48
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,719
which has put a lot of employees to

49
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,479
remote operations

50
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,080
it was in the focus of attention in

51
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,280
order to analyze and big number of re

52
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,680
remote workplaces how does it influence

53
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,440
in the conditions of new realities and

54
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,200
in the conditions of cyber threats

55
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,640
against the bank

56
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,560
well you have described situation pretty

57
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,360
well

58
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,480
uh you know there were pandemics attacks

59
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,000
and uh

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,760
but something hardcore something

61
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,080
unexpected can we speak about that for

62
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,680
example we had a january and we had

63
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,920
february and then suddenly march came

64
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,319
and what happened after march april my

65
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,560
god and right now it's may

66
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,879
so what has changed on the border lines

67
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,480
from the point of view of activities of

68
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,200
hacker groups from the point of view of

69
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,319
loading of expert teams inside of

70
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,319
companies

71
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,080
vladimir i would like to add a little

72
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,840
bit and back to your question what has

73
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,080
changed and about top managers

74
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,120
well this is the moment unique moment

75
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,640
when it comes to many years we've been

76
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,080
telling you that top management has to

77
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,000
participate in cyber security but what

78
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
management they participated but they

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,879
did not dive into it and unfortunately

80
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,120
these february events they didn't give

81
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,760
us any chance of staying outside of it

82
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,360
if previously during the discussion

83
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,959
about cyber security and agenda we've

84
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,680
been looking downwards top managers have

85
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,640
been

86
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,360
disregarding it but more or less things

87
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,959
like that happening in financial sectors

88
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,720
all top managers have got together

89
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,920
they've grouped together and they

90
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,120
started understanding what really

91
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,680
happened they create crisis committees

92
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,239
they start understanding what has

93
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,560
brought down for example cyber attack

94
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,920
happening they have been already

95
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,159
informed and what works what doesn't

96
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,080
work and the first thing they have to

97
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,400
understand and as i understand

98
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,799
this is the best practice on the side of

99
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,319
the business creating this crisis

100
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,519
committee discovery of key

101
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,599
areas of activities which have suffered

102
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,959
on the side of the client and inside of

103
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,480
the internal processes on the side of

104
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,200
the partners and then forming of a

105
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,200
proper set of expertise and

106
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,640
communications for example your top

107
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,799
manager and you are the captain and your

108
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,000
sheep moves uh towards the iceberg and

109
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,760
you should make a proper decision you

110
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,159
should give commands executives should

111
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,079
follow the competencies and knowledge to

112
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,320
execute these commands in a proper way

113
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,639
so these sets these groups of reactions

114
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,880
crisis groups on one side they became

115
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,520
a solution but on the other side have

116
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,600
included all top managers the first

117
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,320
entities everybody yes pasha maybe

118
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,919
you're going to tell us who should be

119
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,280
the part of it well in the beginning i

120
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,199
would like to tell you the teams have

121
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,680
changed the anti-crisis management team

122
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,040
have changed

123
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,680
this we can you list the roles yes uh

124
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,600
all the representatives of information

125
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,199
security blogs definitely aware i see

126
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,240
definitely we have hired top manager who

127
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,840
makes strategic willful

128
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,080
decisions let's say financial director

129
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,240
cfo a business director operational

130
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,080
director are they part of this yeah

131
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,680
operational financial and business

132
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,880
development director and ceo as well

133
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,880
well the names of positions are

134
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,600
different but these should be

135
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,360
representatives of main business

136
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,639
sections main supporting facilities and

137
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,360
what also is very important what i

138
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,600
notice that right now

139
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,320
more technical specialists not

140
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,720
necessarily of very high level of their

141
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,759
positions

142
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,600
with very high level of knowledge of

143
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,160
competencies they also get involved in

144
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,560
these meetings of operative teams

145
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,919
anti-crisis bodies of authority because

146
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,240
their opinion is very valuable it's not

147
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,000
necessarily a big position but most

148
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,840
importantly they need competency and

149
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,240
also it is important that these

150
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,680
anti-crisis body of management

151
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,800
should be flexible in their composition

152
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,199
prior to pandemics these were certain

153
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,680
people as a rule inside of their

154
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,039
companies they've defined in their

155
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,800
documents they have certain fixed list

156
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,880
of who's going to be the part of this

157
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,240
body

158
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,479
and it was a very standard one and

159
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,039
during pandemics

160
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,319
big number of employees have been

161
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,560
involved in these anti-crisis management

162
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,120
committees

163
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,360
undoubtedly these are managers people

164
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,199
who make decisions from the point of

165
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,199
view of personal from the point of view

166
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,080
of hiring

167
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,880
right now situation is changing

168
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,800
and due to changing of this situation

169
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,199
the teams are changing as well and i

170
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,120
told you big number of it specialists

171
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,000
and cyber security specialists

172
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,759
they are playing the main role in this

173
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,319
orchestra

174
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,479
the first vladimir putin have signed the

175
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,800
decree which which speaks about two

176
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,560
simple and understandable things the

177
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,280
first one

178
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,800
every comedy should have a deputy of the

179
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,199
company which provides management and

180
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,960
control over the information security

181
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,479
questions and the second topic is that

182
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,319
until 2025

183
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,759
companies have to get read

184
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,080
of cyber security

185
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,960
decisions uh software from unfriendly

186
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,000
countries

187
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,560
does it reinforce

188
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,120
the work of this

189
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,880
team

190
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,960
which has appeared after 24th of

191
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,160
february does it bring this decree some

192
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,960
additional

193
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,720
factors of stimulus or this is just a

194
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,840
legislative confirmation and

195
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,479
officialization of the fact that

196
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,240
these management bodies have already

197
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,080
been established inside of the company

198
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,560
well let me begin with this answer how

199
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,840
did it happen

200
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,120
when a company had faced with

201
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,319
mass number of attacks and they started

202
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,160
targeted attacks and we've looked at

203
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,120
analytics in positive 70 of all the

204
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,199
attacks are addressed attacks not just

205
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,120
coverage searching for something but

206
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,199
very addressed specifically against

207
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,800
specific company against specific

208
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,639
personal data confidential information

209
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,160
leakages and stoppage of the process

210
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,319
these are three main targets destructive

211
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,319
targets so they've been addressed and

212
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,479
destructive what else have been added

213
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,080
public relations pr have been added

214
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,720
because we've never seen any internet in

215
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,360
open resources so much information about

216
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,960
cyber incidents

217
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,120
and these are singular percentages

218
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,360
compared to what is happening yeah

219
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,320
maximum so right now we can say tops

220
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,320
also have understood

221
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,080
that their role first of all it's

222
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,839
related to top entities because there

223
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,479
were events in mass media in advanced

224
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,839
mass media where top management of

225
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,320
companies was involved in this situation

226
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,240
and they have understood that their role

227
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,160
is very important then they have seen

228
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,399
the following that decision-making about

229
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,920
a rejection of the attacks and big

230
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,839
corporations a big bureaucratized

231
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,240
company without political authority does

232
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,920
not work and they had to move very fast

233
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,320
they had to globe close access they had

234
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,399
to block some usual channels of

235
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,480
communications uh which are convenient

236
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,880
for use for top management to prevent

237
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,200
the catastrophe what is needed

238
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,680
we need more authorities on the side of

239
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,480
security uh where the ceo and top

240
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,320
management of the communists came and

241
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,399
started doing this then companies have

242
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,760
increased their level of cyber defense

243
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,160
cyber responsiveness well they breathe

244
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,160
out they defended themselves from the

245
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,160
doors from web applications they defend

246
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,600
themselves internally they've cleaned

247
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,640
themselves

248
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,760
and

249
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,360
they got used to it they got used to it

250
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,959
they say okay every day we're being

251
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,600
attacked and here it is very important

252
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,480
not to lose these dynamics because from

253
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
one side what was done by the law that

254
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,399
you've been speaking about because it

255
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,640
introduces

256
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,320
personal on the level of top management

257
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,000
personnel which has those authorities

258
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,480
which were required during these crisis

259
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,720
days so that it wouldn't be just useful

260
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,920
a role for one-time activity doing but

261
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,600
it should be a full-scale leader which

262
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,839
has necessary authority and who works

263
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,560
and develops cyber security having this

264
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,240
knowledge and functions and makes these

265
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,399
decisions and this is beautiful from the

266
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,079
point of legislation and from the point

267
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,560
of view of realization of defense it is

268
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,560
also very important

269
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,480
irrespectively are they used to it or

270
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,560
not but we need to keep the dynamics and

271
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,079
we should bring this reinforcement of

272
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,600
cyber defense to working system of

273
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,800
continuous monitoring of what is really

274
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,560
happening and how can we defend the

275
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,959
company from destruction

276
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,800
so i would like to add to this a little

277
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,640
bit in couple of topics about the

278
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,800
informational field

279
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,839
truthfully this topic is a very careful

280
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,320
topic and big companies outside they

281
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,480
inform us about something interesting

282
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,200
and they're really

283
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,160
these recommendations are given when the

284
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,480
nail is sticking out of your tire and

285
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,320
you cannot change anything and they're

286
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,079
trying to say well everything's good but

287
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,839
well it's not that bad they're saying

288
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,720
yeah truthfully yeah the tire has been

289
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,880
uh flattened but in all informational

290
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,959
channels the information says okay guys

291
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,279
everybody says totally differently so

292
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,279
the reaction from this side of press

293
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,079
services of the company also should be

294
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,240
adequately

295
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,360
yes we do see positive changes we do see

296
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,600
more and more often adequate reaction to

297
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,360
what's happening

298
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,480
and i'm observing uh right now we have

299
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,600
13

300
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
systematically important banks how these

301
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,160
banks work in the external informational

302
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,240
field i see how in telegram they publish

303
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,640
notifications from big banks that yes we

304
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,320
do confirm to the fact that we do have

305
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,480
some difficulties

306
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,360
they give real forecasts

307
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,120
when they can be

308
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,800
removed and i see a great advantage here

309
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,600
because users clients they feel this

310
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,200
connection everybody understands that

311
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,880
this is happening they understand that

312
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,720
this is not something good but i'm being

313
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,959
informed and have more trust and i have

314
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,120
understanding because you know the

315
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,200
concern comes when you have no

316
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,959
information so from this point of view i

317
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,880
definitely see this positive dynamics

318
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,720
and from the point of view

319
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,519
roma up how do we get used to these

320
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,279
attacks

321
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,279
what do i think about that

322
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,800
compared to sanction related packages

323
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,920
compared to this influence

324
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,120
against our economy

325
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,000
where you can feel the bottom we are

326
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,920
still searching for this bottom and

327
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,800
every

328
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,680
time we see something even deeper

329
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,600
cyber threats

330
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,800
you cannot

331
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,360
feel them they are not tangible we get

332
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,000
used to the effect of their availability

333
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,600
in this scale which was not available

334
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,519
previously but we have to understand

335
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,079
that we don't have the horizon when this

336
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,600
will come to an end don't have the

337
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,399
horizontal

338
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,720
we can look at some direct economical

339
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,639
influences but when something mass

340
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,880
centralized has been prepared and when

341
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,480
all this is going to explode nobody

342
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,560
knows that and respectively to the fact

343
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,839
that there is a certain cost to certain

344
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,839
attacks of course the interest is very

345
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,200
high in our country it's very important

346
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,800
to understand that we always have to

347
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,519
stay ready we always have to be ready

348
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,040
from one side you know things that you

349
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,880
do professionally yourself and other

350
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,560
from the other side things that we are

351
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,639
showing the concept of excluding

352
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,880
inacceptable inadmissible it tells us

353
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,040
that of course we are tuned for the best

354
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,320
for the development of the economy of

355
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,920
the growth but at the same time this

356
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,480
development is impossible dynamically if

357
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,120
you will have big events in admissible

358
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,959
events which will destroy your business

359
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,639
and not just you will have to roll it

360
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,360
back all your efforts but also

361
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,920
they will compress the

362
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,480
shrink the company well but inadmissible

363
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,240
events i would like to make a remark

364
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,320
here what really happens we see the

365
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,560
reassessment of which events are

366
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,040
considered to be an admissible and the

367
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,480
analysis of influence against the

368
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,760
business

369
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,440
of the large companies and they've been

370
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,839
conducting it like two years ago were

371
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,240
businesses that been participating in

372
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,600
this process on the full scale and

373
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,000
they've been trying to defend themselves

374
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,680
uh from all the sides

375
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,839
35 fears that i have to cover of course

376
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,839
all of them are critical and everybody

377
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,000
tried to con confirm it on the

378
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,240
documentary level and nobody's been

379
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,680
scared by the condition but right now

380
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,199
it's a break point

381
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,800
and i know that in many companies and we

382
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,000
have professional communities we

383
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,920
communicate with them they've started a

384
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,320
new process operative analysis of

385
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,600
influence against the business and

386
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,279
reassessment of

387
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,399
what is really important right now right

388
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,240
here because on this particular

389
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,600
important stage

390
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,079
companies will concentrate their defense

391
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,920
on this particular stage and we have to

392
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,440
keep it

393
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,040
because this is about target setting

394
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,199
when you don't have 200 priorities out

395
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,279
of different departments and but all the

396
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,360
way but well ivan vasilevich should not

397
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,440
lose this paper because this paper has

398
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,839
this special stamp and we are not giving

399
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,760
those stamps to anybody yeah classical

400
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,800
example is the reporting banks they love

401
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,279
reporting uh these are requirements of

402
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,800
regulators and these requirements are

403
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,920
very

404
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,440
important and everybody is trying to

405
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,959
send a monthly or quarterly or semantic

406
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,240
reporting and put it in the corner of

407
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,920
this defended space speaking that well

408
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,600
they need these papers

409
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
otherwise uh we have regulatory

410
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,560
consequences as penalties and right now

411
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,720
put this on the scale you're reporting

412
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,199
and a real uh billion of rubles have

413
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,480
been stolen well in current conditions

414
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,920
they're getting disconnected from

415
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,079
previous situations of regulators look

416
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,040
differently uh the financial community

417
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,639
and they started thinking about those

418
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,040
requirements of course definitely and we

419
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,880
need to have a certain support of

420
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,360
certain moments speaking about system

421
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,600
important banks this is precisely like

422
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,160
that because system important banks uh

423
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,480
13 of them they provide 70

424
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,160
of

425
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,959
all banking assets activities

426
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,240
definitely and we can find agreement and

427
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,639
there's a dialogue with regulator and

428
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,480
it's a constant dialogue and of course

429
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,880
prioritization right now comes to a new

430
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,440
level okay look well speaking about

431
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,560
companies about banks in particular

432
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,079
how much in this situation that we're

433
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,600
speaking about

434
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,240
how much this target setting changes

435
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,880
how much establishment of these

436
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,320
new management

437
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,720
bodies in the company change internal

438
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,800
processes and so inside of organizations

439
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,160
because

440
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,240
these are procedures of communications

441
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,160
defined document flow this is big

442
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,600
systems

443
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,079
thousands of people involved

444
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,560
applications processes this is very

445
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,639
complicated and i think changes are

446
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,560
happening not on the whole landscape

447
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,240
especially speaking about the land

448
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,560
financial organizations of remembering

449
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,039
that there is a reassessment happening

450
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,240
in the course of the analysis of

451
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,199
influence against the business

452
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,079
reassessment of what is most critical to

453
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,480
us naturally speaking in most critical

454
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,319
ones in most critical areas of

455
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,359
activities especially in new bank we see

456
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,359
maximal

457
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,119
bureaucratization if it is aimed

458
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,640
on security

459
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,319
in some other areas auxiliary or maybe

460
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,559
in the areas inside of the bank

461
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,360
providing functions i would say they do

462
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,600
change their approaches they do change

463
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,480
their algorithms they do change well

464
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,720
you're saying that

465
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,640
that's the way i hear you

466
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,559
they're generally speaking they do

467
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,600
change processes but today you

468
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,240
are being hacked today and you shouldn't

469
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,400
think about those papers you should

470
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,320
react immediately or you should be ready

471
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,799
for this reaction so

472
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,880
i think it should change the paradigm of

473
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,720
thinking inside of the company and

474
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,640
target standing inside of a company that

475
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,720
these shouldn't happen one two three and

476
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,960
everything else is secondary let it be

477
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,799
well it changes the

478
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,720
perception inside of the organization to

479
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,640
those bureaucratic processes which are

480
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,679
available do you see any changes in this

481
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,440
process component with the consideration

482
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,240
of prioritization of the cyber security

483
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,200
topic

484
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,880
or this is a reactive reaction or a

485
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,559
defensive reaction

486
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,160
but what do i see on one side

487
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,200
everybody's looking at

488
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,520
removal of attacks and consequences and

489
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,600
restore from restoration from districts

490
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,039
and what i think from the point of view

491
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,600
of the industry

492
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,200
the rules

493
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,919
and documents and procedures they came

494
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,160
not to the second but to the tenth level

495
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,320
of importance so i think that crisis

496
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,520
committees they also work on certain

497
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,360
basic principles but then execution and

498
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,880
restoration is happening level of

499
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,679
competencies in specific situations and

500
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:02,880
management

501
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,880
of these irrespectively to the rules of

502
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,400
the game and right now i'd like to add

503
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,000
another topic to this from the point of

504
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,039
view of regulation what do we see it's

505
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,760
not a secret periodically we hear the

506
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,760
questions about regulators some

507
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,840
documents have been outdated some of

508
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,760
them not been published and we do see

509
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,280
dynamics that documents are being

510
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,480
published very fast and they define

511
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,280
the

512
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,760
background but without going deep into

513
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,720
certain

514
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,039
complicated variations of execution they

515
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,919
try to find the golden uh approach and

516
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,160
this is good from two sides first of all

517
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,240
they on the top level they understand

518
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,679
and everybody's moving in the proper

519
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,840
direction where they've been sent to but

520
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,000
on the other side their hands are open

521
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,160
untied and you can do whatever you need

522
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,520
to do from this point of view so in the

523
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,720
companies we see similar change of

524
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,200
balances

525
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,240
but this legacy bureaucratic legacy is

526
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,000
still pushing us well of course

527
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,720
bureaucracy is not always bad sometimes

528
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,120
sometimes those mechanisms which were

529
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,679
developed because many years they work

530
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,400
effectively we cannot say that we are in

531
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,679
a certain

532
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,159
uh outdated legacy condition

533
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,600
moreover financial banking industry is a

534
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,840
very serious industry it's over

535
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,360
regulated

536
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,000
so the changes of balances are happening

537
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,720
as for the speed of decision making yes

538
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,520
the speed has sped up decisions are

539
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,559
being made not within days central bank

540
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,360
produces documents very fast

541
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,360
with interest rates and the reaction is

542
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,120
very fast as we can see it right now by

543
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,120
the process inside when they're being

544
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,799
executed

545
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,200
the search of the balance still stays

546
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,440
there and if there's an opportunity

547
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,960
of not getting away from non-checked

548
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,120
solutions

549
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,679
if this opportunity is available then of

550
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,360
course it's being used and i have a

551
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,760
final question to you and give me the

552
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,400
brief number bring brief answer with

553
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,600
numbers when we say that before 2025

554
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,840
we should have full replacement of

555
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,919
security products inside of critical

556
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,159
infrastructure by domestic products or

557
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,320
products from friendly countries

558
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,520
including russia which according to you

559
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,520
percentage of solutions should be

560
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,559
replaced

561
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,000
how many should they replace if you take

562
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,679
hundred percent of all the security

563
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,240
solutions used in the banking sector

564
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,159
this decree tells us how many in a

565
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,240
percentage-wise should be replaced how

566
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,000
many of them

567
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
well i will be the first one

568
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,400
be brief be brief there is a phrase

569
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,000
sovereignty and sovereignty it's a

570
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,280
possibility of the company to operate

571
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,200
independently from whatever happens or

572
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,360
with minimal dependency from external

573
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,720
factors according to my opinion

574
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,799
as a security guy i want to replace

575
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,120
everything objectively we see some

576
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,799
device has been disconnected foreign

577
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,760
device well we have naughty fans

578
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,679
which means it's not always possible and

579
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,080
it's not always economically feasible so

580
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,520
that's your answer speaking about

581
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,200
critical points or nodules or processes

582
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,320
or

583
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,159
where the inacceptable events might

584
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,640
happen then 100 replacement everything

585
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,679
else but how much in percentage in total

586
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:18,960
how much should be replaced for example

587
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,360
by 2025 should be a hundred percent

588
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,559
replacement yep uh under turbine 100 you

589
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,640
did not get my question

590
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,360
right now

591
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,320
there is a certain percentage of

592
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,360
trusted software and some percentage of

593
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,679
not trusted so this percentage of

594
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,159
non-trusted should be replaced by 25. so

595
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,760
there is a percentage of non-trusted how

596
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,360
much is it

597
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,039
is it five percent

598
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,880
eighty percent

599
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,760
right now how much is it how much

600
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,200
should we work

601
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,480
approximately

602
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,600
well my intuitive assessment is on the

603
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,440
level of fifty percent

604
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,880
so i apologize okay i get it

605
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,080
i wouldn't confirm or wouldn't deny it

606
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,080
fifty percent but big significance will

607
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,320
be about equality because if we will get

608
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,600
some friendly or domestic products and

609
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,400
they do comply to the quality criteria

610
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,080
then of course on a step-by-step basis

611
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,880
we should replace everything but if we

612
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,600
understand that solutions are still not

613
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,760
complete not mature and they have to be

614
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,200
complete and this is normal story

615
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,640
especially in such a short period of

616
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,039
time then we have to be very careful we

617
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,960
have to remember about continuity of the

618
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,360
business and we should move forward

619
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,919
analyzing which quality we understand we

620
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,840
get so i think this is an important

621
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,080
moment to pay attention not only to

622
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,200
numbers not only to fact but also to how

623
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,880
we are able to do that well speaking

624
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,760
about numbers if we're going to judge

625
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,320
external sources of information from

626
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,440
russia

627
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,640
we have seen many foreign vendors in the

628
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,760
area of security have left total market

629
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,559
size of which was a level of 80 billion

630
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,600
rubles

631
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,919
from judging

632
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,559
public numbers total market value of

633
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,279
cyber security in russia in 2021 was a

634
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,880
level of 150 billion rubles

635
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,919
but almost half of it is a volume of

636
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,200
solutions of which we have to replace

637
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,400
and the deadline well 2025 is still too

638
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,000
far away but considering the fact that

639
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,919
these solutions

640
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,720
are not simple installations are not

641
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,600
simple completions and information then

642
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,080
i can say that time is very compressed

643
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,559
but the russian cyber security industry

644
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,679
is stimulated by this and it has the

645
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,640
very good

646
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,640
oil and possibility to work so thank you

647
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,559
very much for your answers it was cyber

648
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,399
security for top managers
