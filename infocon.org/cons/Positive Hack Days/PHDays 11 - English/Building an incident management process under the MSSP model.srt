1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,759
uh good afternoon dear colleagues my

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,400
name is roman otnikov i'm head of

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,639
execution department at security

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,240
division

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,080
well we're going to talk a bit about

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,640
mssp but firstly i'd like to share my

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,480
impression of the preset the previous

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,760
presentation

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,000
i'm not trying to say anything but i

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,439
just understood

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,160
once again how our information security

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,840
market is so small considering that the

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,040
market was evaluated as uh 98 or 100

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,280
million rubles a billion rubles then we

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,920
have an i.t project which is comparable

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,680
in size we just need to understand how

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,239
high we can grow

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,039
today i would like to talk about mssp

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,039
to touch upon the subjects and in

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,640
particular on some

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,039
subtle points about incident management

22
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,760
in the mssp model let's start with the

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,640
simple so what is mssp

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,400
mssp

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,960
is a provider of services

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,400
in the area of information security

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,520
so in the beginning we had msp providers

28
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,360
who were more about providing i.t

29
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,159
services and then it evolved in addition

30
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,360
to i.t

31
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,200
information security

32
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,840
came to be needed and so mssp

33
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,080
as a provider to pro provider of

34
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,119
services in information security

35
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,560
an mss provider is a company

36
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,240
that spends

37
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,600
100 percent of the efforts

38
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,960
regarding

39
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,600
information security it's their business

40
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,920
it's the core business it generates the

41
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,280
revenues

42
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,920
this is where all the expertise and

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,479
everything else focuses

44
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,960
as to the msb services there are quite

45
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,479
a lot of them uh something uh to deal

46
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,680
with the uh provision of security of the

47
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,119
infrastructure

48
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,840
awareness

49
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,280
protectedness and one of the uh most

50
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,080
asked for services uh what is a

51
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,879
regarding commercial soc and everything

52
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,160
to do with it monitoring investigations

53
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,879
uh

54
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,200
incidence response so today i'm not

55
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,840
going to talk about the mssp market as

56
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,800
it is but about a small part related to

57
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,360
commercials socs

58
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,959
why

59
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,519
do we need mssps as i said

60
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:34,840
they

61
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,480
concentrate

62
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,720
the expertise as expertise can be scaled

63
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,319
for customers for the customers to quick

64
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,200
start getting a budget getting a quality

65
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,879
product and

66
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,800
no need to

67
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,840
build everything within their

68
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,239
organizations so they can uh

69
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,560
pass something on to departures why do

70
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,400
they want to talk about this now because

71
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,760
historically the msp market

72
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,599
was not so

73
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,040
large in russia compared to the

74
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,959
worldwide market in the world

75
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,959
the mssp market has been growing since

76
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,080
for quite a long time now

77
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,040
whereas in this country it didn't happen

78
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,360
that way but there were several drivers

79
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,280
catalyzers

80
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,920
that also pushed this trend i think the

81
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,680
first point was corvid

82
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,040
when everybody went home to work

83
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,000
when a lot of things now were disrupted

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,920
in terms of logistics and other things

85
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,920
that the companies had to change

86
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,599
all this and

87
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,000
also they had to change the information

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,560
security processes that's uh that was

89
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,879
the point where msp started to grow

90
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,280
exponentially and the second point in

91
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,760
time was at the end of february this

92
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,480
year where again we got information

93
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,080
security problems everybody is aware of

94
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,599
them i'm not going to talk about them in

95
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,920
detail but that was another driver

96
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,760
to push the mssp market up in russia

97
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,080
as i've already said we're going to

98
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,879
focus your attention on commercial stock

99
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,400
services when you're talking about socks

100
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,080
as a whole we've been talking about them

101
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,760
for a long time in different conferences

102
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,280
we've always been

103
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,920
always been saying

104
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,798
that

105
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,000
socs need expertise

106
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,639
talents routine tasks and so one of the

107
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,080
solutions

108
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,479
is automation if we're talking a msp

109
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,600
provider

110
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,600
then it's all even doubly important

111
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,639
there

112
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,080
so the level of evidence is being

113
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,240
provided in the commercial so as uh sock

114
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,720
to analyze all the incidents is just a

115
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,840
pipeline

116
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,520
it's the conveyor belt

117
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,800
so for them

118
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
the

119
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,040
it's even more important that they could

120
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,840
organize their work uh efficiently uh

121
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,639
that they should uh assure a high

122
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,400
quality of their decisions they need to

123
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,880
be protected from errors and because

124
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,040
they're providing this as a service it's

125
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,960
also very important for them to stay

126
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,360
within their own sla

127
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,919
commitments that they have

128
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,919
as part of their customer contracts so

129
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,680
for them everything to do with the

130
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,000
automation of their activities and in

131
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,280
particular

132
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,560
monitoring

133
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,440
investigation response

134
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,000
is especially important for them we as a

135
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,680
vendor

136
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,560
that deals with the automation of

137
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,639
information security process management

138
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,800
we see that so we'll see that the mssp

139
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
market is growing on the other hand

140
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,160
we see their needs in automation and so

141
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,720
it's about some specific features about

142
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,400
mssp management

143
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,880
regarding automation uh i would like to

144
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,120
talk today

145
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,320
so the first thing

146
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,120
the first part

147
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,560
is about the

148
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,800
processing

149
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,479
when i say processing

150
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,080
i mean everything

151
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,600
life cycle

152
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,039
regulations

153
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,280
way book everything

154
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,840
i play books i uh

155
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,880
brought it all together

156
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,600
so there are several differences here uh

157
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,680
compared to a clear classic in-house

158
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,240
sock firstly a commercial soaking an

159
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,960
mssp provider sock processes incidents

160
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,880
that they get from different customers

161
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,759
so the most important task when they get

162
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,120
some alert

163
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,919
some event the first the main task for

164
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:24,720
them

165
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,520
is

166
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,960
to understand

167
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,479
uh which

168
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,240
customer or tenant this event belongs to

169
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,960
why is it so important because

170
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,479
the mssp

171
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,120
may provide services in different ways

172
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,520
cloud services hybrid services in-house

173
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,800
services

174
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,000
they may use all different automation

175
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,919
tools and cm systems actually uh quite

176
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,800
often they use scms for monitoring the

177
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,960
ecm systems can be different

178
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,280
even in the same commercial stock it is

179
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,039
quite often they have several cems

180
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,960
installed at the same time and when

181
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,479
customers are connected uh customer cms

182
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,720
can be used so you have diverse ems each

183
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,120
of which

184
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,400
has

185
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,800
its own multi-tenancy mode

186
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,639
they have different words for their

187
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,639
terms for that and their main custom

188
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,319
attendance and so on everywhere uh a way

189
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,440
to

190
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,400
determine uh the ownership of the elect

191
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,960
is their own and it's

192
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,599
very important for the msp provider to

193
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:30,560
identify

194
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,639
the ownership

195
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,280
correctly because further on all the

196
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,840
processes

197
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,160
that are going to be used

198
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,039
should

199
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,000
ensure

200
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,720
the separation of data

201
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,560
between customers

202
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,479
the second part

203
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,560
it's about the

204
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,800
implementation of playbooks life cycles

205
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,319
and things like that if we're talking

206
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,479
about the normal in-house soc talk then

207
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,840
when we're doing up

208
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,800
a an incident management process

209
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,000
when

210
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,840
we draw up a response playbook we

211
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,680
proceed from the fact that we

212
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,560
know very accurately act accurately our

213
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,120
infrastructure and policies and other

214
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,240
things and we can use these details to

215
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,080
improve the efficiency and effectiveness

216
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,039
of our process uh the msp provider

217
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,759
cannot is not in the position of

218
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,000
operating uh this data because they're

219
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
providing a service to a broad range of

220
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,360
customers so they need to have some

221
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,799
standardization

222
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,519
uh unification so everything that they

223
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,760
use in their processes playbooks and

224
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,360
automation

225
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,440
mechanism should be categorized and

226
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,640
generalized what does that mean

227
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,200
just a simple chain in

228
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,000
some playbook if we say that a category

229
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,200
a event has happened

230
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,800
we need to

231
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,279
perform a series of actions on some

232
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,000
category b nodes and also send

233
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,480
notifications to a group of persons of

234
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,760
category c

235
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,240
so in the provider

236
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,720
playbooks it's exactly the way these

237
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,080
things are

238
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,399
explained all these various variables

239
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,560
should dynamically

240
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,720
go to specific playbooks and uh

241
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,800
processes depending on the customer the

242
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,240
tenant that the service is being

243
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,640
provided to the next point

244
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,480
it's about

245
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,120
the thing that because we're

246
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,200
offering a service to someone we need to

247
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,080
keep it informed we can't

248
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,880
just wait until the end of the incident

249
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,360
investigation and the reporting period

250
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,600
so we've done this and we're good guys

251
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,839
now

252
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,120
in the very

253
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,600
life cycle of the incident we have to be

254
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,720
in constant touch with the customer

255
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,440
so there's a suspicion of an incident

256
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,600
that we've logged we need to inform the

257
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,640
customer about that so we proceeded with

258
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,880
the investigation and categorization we

259
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,040
need to keep the customer informed we

260
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,839
finished them these operations so we

261
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,760
confirmed that this was an incident and

262
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,240
then we also passed information uh we

263
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,440
issue some recommendations to the

264
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,360
customer what they need to do to respond

265
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,000
to citizens also we inform them about

266
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,079
that so it's important that at every

267
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,040
stage of the life cycle you need to be

268
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,040
in close collaboration and communication

269
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,959
with your customer

270
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,640
the next point

271
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,240
it's about

272
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,680
again when we're talking about an

273
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,200
in-house soc

274
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,480
you are inside this company you have

275
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,200
access to the entire infrastructure to

276
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,440
all the people and so on when we are

277
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,480
talking about commercial soc

278
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,160
we have several

279
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,480
entry points as contact persons and

280
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,880
don't have all the required access so we

281
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,480
need to build our process based on this

282
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,880
and this on this understanding what do i

283
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,440
mean let me give you an example

284
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,760
a classic brute force attack

285
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,880
what usually

286
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,279
do people in the penthouse in the

287
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,800
in-house soc

288
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,440
well one of the first actions is to

289
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,760
try to phone or get in touch with a

290
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,480
person a link to this incident and check

291
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,200
with it what they've been doing uh

292
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,040
in a commercial soc

293
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,959
the operator does not have access to

294
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,959
this employee and they have to act to a

295
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,360
contact person or another incident with

296
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,920
privileges for instance if in a classic

297
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,640
soc the operator could look

298
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,760
up in some service desk whether

299
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,920
there has been a ticket

300
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,320
an official ticket to

301
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,680
raise the privileges for this employee

302
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,560
especially in the commercial soc cannot

303
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,000
have this information during the

304
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,079
investigation they need to get it

305
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,959
additionally and this all has to be

306
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,040
taken account of when

307
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,560
designing the

308
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,320
processing process

309
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,440
also

310
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,240
because many people work with mssp

311
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,680
providers following a model that

312
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,839
everything is in the cloud that's with

313
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,560
the provider then all a lot of things

314
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,200
related to the execution or certain

315
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,519
actions uh are performed by the customer

316
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,519
themselves manually following the

317
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,600
recommendations from the provider

318
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,560
so you need to include in your playbook

319
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,880
that there are phases that we can't

320
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,399
control directly uh that can

321
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,560
take an indefinite time and where

322
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,720
we are going to operate in some kind of

323
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,240
vacuum

324
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,920
you need to keep it constantly in touch

325
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,320
with the customer why is it so important

326
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,720
because as a minimum when we're talking

327
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,880
uh about these things uh you need to

328
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,480
take account

329
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,839
of these things

330
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,079
you need to include

331
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,120
the

332
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,320
response time when you're outsourcing

333
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,079
something to the mssp uh also uh

334
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,120
customers are not always uh very fast to

335
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,240
respond and you get new uh tasks so for

336
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,920
instance if you don't see that there's

337
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,440
no feedback with a customer as a result

338
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,279
of direction they're not responding you

339
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,279
need to nudge them

340
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,560
keep nudging them

341
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,639
asking them is everything clear do you

342
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,920
need any additional help have you closed

343
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,000
the incident and so on so it's also very

344
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,360
important the next point

345
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,120
with the infrastructure and the

346
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,560
employees

347
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,040
msp is a service

348
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,399
for a broad range of customers

349
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,839
some of them are critical information uh

350
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:42,880
information

351
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,000
infrastructure uh operation operator

352
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,839
uh

353
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:48,800
others

354
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,360
need to have additional information

355
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,680
about employees and sites

356
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,560
it's all part of certain uh playbooks on

357
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,800
uh the

358
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,839
interaction uh with uh fincert and

359
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,240
critical infrastructure

360
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,639
control

361
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,720
i've already mentioned that customer

362
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,040
interaction is a must there are two

363
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,399
important tools here the first type of

364
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,279
interaction goes through some portal or

365
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,680
a personal account

366
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,840
the customer account

367
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,199
[Music]

368
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,560
and another way is that

369
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,360
you are within the infrastructure and

370
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,720
say it's only from it you can interact

371
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,160
with some with the systems here you have

372
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,880
to organize a certain customer accounts

373
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,839
that will be accessible from the outside

374
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,519
you know that has all the information he

375
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,480
needs

376
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,680
and also this portal might

377
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,560
also have some

378
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,000
capabilities

379
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
to modernize

380
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,399
the forms of providing information

381
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,839
to the customer because as you have seen

382
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,320
the presentation of information

383
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,720
that we can is not needed by the

384
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,079
customer so you need to mask some data

385
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,920
the next point we're talking indefinite

386
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,160
range of customers like we know that

387
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,480
today there are 10 of them uh in a month

388
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,000
it can be 12.

389
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,079
you have to

390
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,920
take account of certain aspects of your

391
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,680
customer maybe

392
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,199
they're talking to you from different

393
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,120
time zones maybe don't speak your

394
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,240
language

395
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,639
so when interacting via some

396
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,959
portals or personal account uh pages uh

397
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,920
you need to take account of

398
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,959
the aspects of

399
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,360
them being able to understand you

400
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,600
so the interface the ui

401
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,920
language time zone

402
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,519
because not everybody

403
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,920
lives in your time zone and the final

404
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,360
point is that if we have organized

405
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,040
a portal like this

406
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,160
and perhaps

407
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,880
we

408
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,839
might

409
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,160
push there at the part

410
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,920
that

411
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,639
response is responsible for incident

412
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,199
response and then you have a task of

413
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,720
synchronizing the data about incidents

414
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,720
between your own your main system and

415
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,360
the one that you made publicly available

416
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,519
and so on

417
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,000
the second format of interaction

418
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,560
and one of the most acknowledged ones

419
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,320
is uh via mail oh mail notification

420
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,759
uh what

421
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,920
kind of subtleties can uh we run into

422
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,160
here the first thing and for me it was a

423
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,399
surprise

424
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,639
msp providers

425
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,360
for them interaction via email maybe the

426
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,880
only channel of interaction with the

427
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,720
customer if

428
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,040
they don't have a web portal

429
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,320
so

430
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,079
i understand all the interaction about

431
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,000
incidents is happening over email so it

432
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,440
looks like

433
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,680
email is a face that the provider

434
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,800
uses to talk to the customer and here a

435
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,759
lot of things a lot depends on

436
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:02,480
the

437
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,919
format of the letter of the message

438
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,760
it's not enough that you've provided the

439
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,079
information about what you found you

440
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,039
always also have to wrap it up

441
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:13,919
in

442
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,760
the attractive form

443
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,760
and here we have sensitization the

444
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,160
weight not just airplane text but

445
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,599
different formats rtf html so

446
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,880
second

447
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,280
email is sometimes only the only way of

448
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,600
interaction between the customer and msp

449
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,640
provider

450
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,679
in those cases uh you get tempted to

451
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,520
manage the incident like the mssp infra

452
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,280
ask for some info for the information

453
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,760
about the incident so we've seen that

454
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,240
we've taken uh and we'll find this

455
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,360
information

456
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,120
please review it yourselves and make a

457
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,000
decision whether it's a feature or

458
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,799
a

459
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,080
an incident the customer wants to answer

460
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,240
this question and this should affect the

461
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,039
life cycle of the incident in the

462
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,440
automation tools of the mssp provider it

463
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,280
looks like we've provided an answer in

464
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,960
the email this answer should be

465
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,799
transformed in some understandable

466
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,200
format in the automation tool uh it

467
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,240
should initiate the resp respective

468
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,160
playbook and lead to the respective

469
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,480
actions the next thing uh

470
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,000
interaction control it's more about

471
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,840
human factor whenever we're talking

472
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,520
about msp again we have lots of

473
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,160
customers we should note a notification

474
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,559
with some information about one customer

475
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,760
to another customer we can't sell say

476
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,960
send

477
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,559
information about

478
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,160
customer a

479
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,679
incident

480
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,880
mentioning urls and domains to customer

481
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,160
b and that should be obvious to the

482
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,200
operator and it should be

483
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,520
expressed in the playbook in order not

484
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,840
to allow that and the last thing here is

485
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,480
percent personalized uh

486
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,160
patterns

487
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,640
templates

488
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,080
it's about slas

489
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,320
if it's an in-house soc you have a clear

490
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,480
set of metrics that shows that your soc

491
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,080
is working correctly

492
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,200
in the msrsp case you have a set of slas

493
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,799
depending on

494
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,720
the level of service for the customer of

495
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,880
the composition of services that we are

496
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,600
uh providing them and you uh have to

497
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,320
bear it all in mind uh so that you

498
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,440
shouldn't uh break some sla as you are

499
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,400
providing the service and so that these

500
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,760
slas should be complied with quite often

501
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,360
uh there's a question about the

502
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,400
distribution of the overall uh inflow of

503
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,720
alerts over the operators because this

504
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,640
is definitely a resource

505
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,280
whenever we're talking about some

506
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,000
a situation where the in-house soc uses

507
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,160
the first two options where there's a

508
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,640
common uh queue and operators pick up

509
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,640
calls from this queue

510
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,840
there is

511
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,960
you can also load balance it and

512
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,400
automate it in mmsps quite often they

513
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,880
use some additional automation tools a

514
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,640
magic formulae

515
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,200
that use some logic to distribute the

516
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,880
incidents

517
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,559
across the agents depending on a set of

518
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,280
attributes and so it's very important

519
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,559
for us so that it shouldn't get too

520
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,960
difficult to become a

521
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,159
an obstacle and finally we can have

522
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,840
dedicated teams to work with specific

523
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,919
customers

524
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,799
and uh last thing regarding reporting

525
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,640
if we are talking about an in-house soc

526
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,280
reporting means some statistics on the

527
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,159
services that we are providing some

528
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,799
monitoring we may be interested in some

529
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,760
distribution across incidents the stages

530
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,280
in attacks

531
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,120
sla

532
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,960
processing time

533
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,799
but if we talk about the mssp reporting

534
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,799
quite often the first

535
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,799
block here is about the execution of sla

536
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,520
for the service we need to know how well

537
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,400
we have complied with with

538
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,000
the sla

539
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,440
commitments

540
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,480
what was

541
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,200
the

542
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,280
response time

543
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,840
availability

544
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,440
time and

545
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,400
if you

546
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
you need to work with this data and you

547
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,240
want to build a

548
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,280
report

549
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,039
that would be available in the same

550
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,600
place but the data come from different

551
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,440
systems and you need to use different

552
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,200
systems to

553
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,960
consolidate the data also i we need to

554
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,440
have this report parameterized so that

555
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,640
we could

556
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,440
uh

557
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,960
prepare this report let's say for

558
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,120
customer a i think i haven't forgotten

559
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,120
everything anything from what i wanted

560
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,960
to uh share

561
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,400
so if you have any questions i'm

562
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,120

563
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,479

565
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,039
