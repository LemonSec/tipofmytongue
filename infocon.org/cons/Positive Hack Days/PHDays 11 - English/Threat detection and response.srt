[Music]

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,000
we're going to continue and right now

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,240
i'm going to speak about discovery of

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,480
threats and reacting to those threats

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,480
and uh solving xdr class

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,679
there's x5x7

7
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,879
from positive technologies

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,719
okay let's give a definition to the

9
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,200
terminology what do you mean by axia

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,079
well xdr

11
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,039
looking from the positive technology

12
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,680
concept site

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,559
extended

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,160
means extended discovery and uh

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,839
reaction and response

16
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,800
complex chain or whatever

17
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,878
it's extended x means extended

18
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,320
and also response

19
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,159
so we have several solutions in this

20
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,000
concept which help the client to see the

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,600
picture together to react on it

22
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,479
and

23
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,759
detect and react

24
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,439
you can detect and then react in a

25
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,000
sequence something like that

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,920
so it's a number of solutions this is

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,200
not one product yes in any concept

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,920
that would be developed by us or other

29
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,920
players we were able to see that

30
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,399
solutions should include

31
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,000
a number of products techniques tactics

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,560
methodologies and everything else so

33
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,280
this is not one solution it's a complex

34
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,360
solution that we utilize

35
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,240
which practical goals can be solved by

36
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,799
this xdr complex well the spectrum is

37
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,920
really wide as igor said already it's a

38
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,799
discovery and response and if we speak

39
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,759
about the

40
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,360
response it can be done immediately

41
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,280
because we didn't have a agent solution

42
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,360
previously which would allow us to

43
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,040
enrich

44
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,599
our uh

45
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,239
discoveries by the context that can be

46
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,480
brought from the workstation server and

47
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,360
from the endpoints because this content

48
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,560
uh has a lot of useful information which

49
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,760
has to be

50
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,760
investigated after discovering those

51
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,840
incidents and also it allows us to have

52
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,440
a big number

53
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,480
of uh threat hunting possibilities uh

54
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,560
you can look retrospectively how the

55
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,560
attack was developing what it has

56
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,480
started from and maybe discover some

57
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,920
facts

58
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,319
which solution types are included into

59
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,120
the xtr you've mentioned end point but

60
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,800
can you lease the whole spectrum from

61
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,280
the market point of view

62
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,640
well

63
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,360
it was already defined the market was

64
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,440
defining the set of solutions but not

65
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,599
the vendors have decided how many

66
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,360
solutions will be included but speaking

67
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,800
about complex

68
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,000
we need everything the world and the

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,480
monitoring solution for the industrial

70
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,400
systems and the

71
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,400
detection and the level of networking

72
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,959
activity detection level of nodes and

73
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,440
everything else so the whole xdr complex

74
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,680
should include everything including cdm

75
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,400
and

76
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,280
uh data and informational uh leaks uh

77
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,640
threat intelligence and well depending

78
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,640
on which vendor was manufacturing this

79
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,560
solution and how the market was taking

80
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,799
it these contexts did work for somebody

81
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,000
it was the sandbox plus agent solution

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,599
for the other one it was network

83
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,400
solution plus agent solution

84
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,400
but the reaction should be happening in

85
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,920
the endpoints and uh karil was

86
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,399
mentioning

87
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,360
we have introduced it into the product

88
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,720
portfolio

89
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,959
and we have created the field

90
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,120
to make a complicated solution on the

91
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,560
basis of cms and books not what i see

92
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,640
okay let's uh

93
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,439
speak about these complicated terms

94
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,680
there's no single definition of what is

95
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,320
xdr on the market

96
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,279
well this is the extended discovery and

97
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,400
response this is a single exist

98
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,880
explanation understood by clients

99
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,120
partners and everybody else well from

100
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,560
the point of view of realization of this

101
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,880
solution everyone moves in this

102
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,199
direction and how people perceive what

103
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,440
is the main idea of this extended

104
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,520
discovery and response as for the

105
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,759
positive it's a security incident

106
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,000
and threat response yeah the basic cm

107
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,680
everything which helps you to see the

108
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,000
incidents in the infrastructure yes all

109
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,199
the attacks

110
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,360
then it's a sandbox something that

111
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,000
allows you to go in the sandbox because

112
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,040
you cannot discover those uh malicious

113
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,919
codes uh without sandbox uh you need to

114
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,840
understand what kind of a malicious code

115
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,840
you understand you model its behavior in

116
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,600
the sandbox which is not helping it to

117
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,039
get out outside what else do we have

118
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,080
discovery means in the network nodes

119
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,720
network attack discovery network traffic

120
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,120
yes edr component

121
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,000
which reacts to the end points and helps

122
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,479
us to launch and stop the processes and

123
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,880
move the files and discover flight so

124
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,960
end point this is what are we going to

125
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,000
speak about

126
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,400
and of course we are con connecting

127
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,160
threat intel it's uh

128
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,360
security

129
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,880
cyber intelligence security

130
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,479
it's a platform which helps to aoki

131
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,160
feeds yards and collect them in one

132
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,120
place

133
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,840
yolk feeds and yards

134
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,039
you have the compromise indicator for

135
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,120
example some domains where it can be

136
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,280
located hash of files etc etc etc so all

137
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,199
the information which is available about

138
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,400
the thread

139
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,199
all this information in database is

140
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,680
being accumulated in one place and the

141
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,639
whole product chain which protects the

142
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,319
xzr solution

143
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,479
everybody knows about this solution so

144
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,000
it's about five products yeah right now

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,680
we have five products

146
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,080
at least uh there should be one product

147
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,560
which can do everything but it's much

148
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,240
better to have a set of solutions which

149
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,160
allow you to work on all the stages and

150
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,919
prevent well let's speak about the end

151
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,080
point endpoint as a separate category of

152
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,080
solutions

153
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,639
to understand what is etr and what is

154
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,560
the antivirus because functionalities

155
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,400
are different speaking about the

156
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,720
antiviral solution npp

157
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,280
something that has to be protect you

158
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,680
from certain threats er rules

159
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,599
compromising indicator that we've been

160
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:58,880
speaking about and this is something

161
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,360
that has certain database and certain

162
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,639
rules

163
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,000
which help you to discover something

164
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,120
about speaking about edr

165
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,440
it's a solution which collects

166
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,520
telemetric information and can build

167
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,840
more complicated uh

168
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,080
reaction schemes to react to those

169
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,360
things which are happening on the end

170
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,840
point which helps us to discover and

171
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,360
describe certain rules which will

172
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,199
predict certain threats about which we

173
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,400
don't know anything or maybe the attack

174
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,240
has happened for example and we have

175
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,840
registered the incident and then we're

176
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,360
trying to figure out how was it

177
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,960
happening and then

178
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,960
these contexts and telemetrics that is

179
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,280
being collected by adr in a certain way

180
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,240
we can just process it uh and understand

181
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,840
what really happened

182
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,479
so this is a more

183
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,560
complicated thing than a simple

184
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,280
antivirus

185
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,599
do i properly understand that by

186
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,400
selecting a path of xdr

187
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,560
which has the protection of the end

188
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,319
points laptop uh desktops and servers

189
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,360
we basically speaking are entering new

190
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,120
market market of endpoint uh protection

191
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,440
it's a big market which previously was

192
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,759
not available to positive technology

193
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,840
because there was no solution yeah it's

194
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,599
a new niche for us

195
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,520
what does it mean reason

196
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,719
why do we launch xdr

197
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,919
what do we do to protect end points

198
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,758
is it a discovery of a new market

199
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,640
it's a level of possibility of giving

200
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,120
the client the tool about

201
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,399
more fast reaction because traditionally

202
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,440
positive technology was making solutions

203
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,680
and monitoring and preventive solutions

204
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,440
we didn't have a lot of other solutions

205
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,000
maybe some not solutions

206
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,640
but when we face

207
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,600
real attacks on client side and this is

208
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,760
what is being done by our expert center

209
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,839
without reaction on the side of end

210
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,600
points and service well we cannot go

211
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,720
without that

212
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,160
and at least analyses of situation

213
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,880
analysis of those tech audits and

214
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,920
everything that is happening in the

215
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,160
market it gives us understanding that in

216
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,560
any case we need this solution and uh

217
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,160
speaking about the product solution and

218
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,160
to defend the clients traditionally it's

219
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,600
considered like that a positive and

220
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,440
manufactured the solution it means it

221
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,399
have a niche

222
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,640
and then we can invest in it and we can

223
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,480
work with this solution well

224
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,800
traditionally it happened like that for

225
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,200
us this is a innovative market and

226
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,519
possibilities for discovery of new

227
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,760
technologies and possibility of helping

228
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,920
the client in those places

229
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,240
where they have not been covered do i

230
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,399
properly understand you that uh by

231
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,120
entering this market we share this field

232
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,839
with a well-known player uh kaspersky

233
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,959
lab speaking about

234
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,320
we are not taking the antivirus

235
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,959
area we take our own segment we

236
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,720
find our own segment from the point of

237
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,760
view of the solution because the

238
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,720
antiviral market it's an old market it

239
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,959
has

240
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,279
anti-viral protection means of stack

241
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,360
certification requirements for different

242
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,120
systems and everybody got used to the

243
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,440
fact that

244
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,880
this is a necessary hygiene but egr

245
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,839
component has a wider authorities

246
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,880
compared to the antiviral system and by

247
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,800
giving this tool in the hands of the

248
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,839
client we give the client the

249
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,440
possibility from the point of view of

250
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,160
the information security to take over

251
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,040
i.t infrastructure so for our

252
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,800
ideal clients it's uh

253
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,680
discovered well previously we had to

254
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,040
leave the application for the ac but

255
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,120
right now the security person can click

256
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,480
their

257
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,680
finger and stop attack on his end point

258
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,079
also would like to add here because for

259
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,480
us xdr everybody remember our concept

260
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,880
that inaccessible events should not be

261
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,240
uh

262
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,240
should become impossible and from these

263
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,880
uh concept xzr is the main reaction

264
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,720
because this is something that allows

265
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,360
this concept to be viable because in

266
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,279
some cases

267
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,600
decision making and reaction should be

268
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,480
immediately

269
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,800
in a certain situation in certain

270
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,279
locations when you have to you know pull

271
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,519
and isolate a certain host and take the

272
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,440
attack and fix it right now and if there

273
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,959
is no agent solution which allows you to

274
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,200
do that immediately all this analytical

275
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,880
information which helps you to discover

276
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,160
it is meaningless

277
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,800
so technologically the mandatory

278
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,880
component for the concept of

279
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,720
inadmissible events

280
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,480
and how complicated this xdr and its

281
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,399
components endpoint from the point of

282
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,880
view of management and exploitation will

283
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,600
it be uh as everybody got used to a big

284
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,680
console with a number of buttons or you

285
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,200
just create this product as something

286
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,040
new maybe it's gonna be something simple

287
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,720
and innovative

288
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,360
yeah we are trying to make it as

289
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,440
advanced as possible without over

290
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,680
complicating the consoles because

291
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,000
we we also

292
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,680
modern song has a lot of consoles and

293
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,440
the main objective of the xdr to make it

294
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,920
in such a way so that people analytics

295
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,839
would look into same console because the

296
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,040
main conceptual objective for the xdr is

297
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,760
to reduce the number of false positives

298
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,399
and reduce time which analytics spent

299
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,720
for processing of incidents because we

300
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,720
need to see understand whether it's

301
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,279
false positive or

302
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,200
give them possibility to automated

303
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,279
reaction and some basic incidents and

304
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,760
cases which can be

305
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,360
resolved by the system and

306
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,480
xdr it's very convenient and flexible

307
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,639
protection

308
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,120
in less uh trusted infrastructural zones

309
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,200
you can do that for every sneeze there

310
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,040
would be a certain response

311
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,440
the active uh threat reaction in some

312
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,120
other more sensitive zones you can do it

313
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,639
in such a way so that we would collect

314
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,880
maximum information would process it but

315
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,480
do nothing automatically before the

316
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,720
person makes a decision

317
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,079
therefore uh speaking about the

318
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,440
complication of the product from the

319
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,279
point of view of exploitation it usually

320
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,560
depends uh

321
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,360
from the infrastructure

322
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,360
and the personal because deployment of

323
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,800
the xdr can be done by one smart person

324
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,959
and we are trying to make this product

325
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,279
universal for the company of any size

326
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,720
because we understand that it's a big

327
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,519
market there are companies medium size

328
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,440
small size companies

329
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,440
with small number of employees and they

330
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,440
don't have resources to work with big

331
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,200
complex stories which are very

332
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,320
cumbersome but on the other side there

333
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,079
are companies which have their own sock

334
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,480
their own expertise their own

335
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,000
threat intelligence etc and our xgr is

336
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,399
very convenient and effective for any

337
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,680
type of users because on one side

338
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,199
we have some expertise that was

339
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,760
accumulated by many of them and then we

340
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,920
have a possibility of extending their

341
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,880
products by the expertise by indicators

342
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,040
by some innovative models etc etc well

343
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,240
you've been speaking about the market

344
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,279
let's speak about the market how do you

345
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,000
evaluate the volume of a need and a

346
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,760
future of the xdr market in russia

347
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,600
well it's a big volume

348
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,720
big consumption market

349
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,399
well we do remember western analogies

350
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,320
and who was in this category who wasn't

351
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,360
who left

352
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,160
well by the way many clients have faced

353
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,560
a problem of departure because they are

354
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,720
not covered but they also see the

355
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,760
situation that most of western players

356
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,680
were cloud ones and by disconnecting

357
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,519
services in russia

358
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,160
they cannot manage these agents so

359
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,399
basically speaking they cannot even

360
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,160
delete anything because if you have

361
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,240
rolled out the infrastructure with 100

362
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,839
agents that's one problem but when you

363
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,800
have 80 000 agents it's a big scale

364
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,440
problem 80 000 installations in a big

365
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,600
network yes when you have the different

366
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,320
sub networks a lot of users

367
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,600
and a lot of players uh paulo altohelet

368
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,320
and quali's left and many others who in

369
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,560
this segment been taking good nation the

370
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,279
russian market and by coming to a

371
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,519
certain pilot projects we do see that

372
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,279
functionality of this solution was used

373
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,959
previously by the client

374
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,160
and they ask of us to realize and repeat

375
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,480
something like that and also uh they're

376
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,320
asking us how can we delete these agents

377
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,680
what can we do with them because there

378
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,079
are two types after the pandemics of the

379
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,639
2020 all the companies have based

380
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,399
remote operations total remote

381
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,040
operations well they had to transfer

382
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,880
everybody into the remote and the access

383
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,720
to the system should be kept so they've

384
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,639
created a lot of agents to personal

385
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,320
notebooks and right now their company

386
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,639
have been divided into personal devices

387
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,079
with these agents they have corporate

388
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,759
devices and it's impossible to delete

389
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,440
them and nothing can be done to them a

390
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,040
new solution cannot be installed because

391
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,519
the agent takes the dominating role over

392
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,040
the antivirus and other services

393
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,320
and security people are in this

394
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,480
situation like guys help us do something

395
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,120
and uh well at least those who left

396
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,560
maybe they're going to come back maybe

397
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,839
they're not going to come back but the

398
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,600
problem is still there and it has to be

399
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,279
solved right now well speaking about the

400
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,440
market niche

401
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,279
well the market niche

402
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,440
in money or

403
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,079
well money would be better it's much

404
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,600
more understandable well then money

405
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,920
speaking money-wise

406
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,480
we did do certain analytical research

407
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,800
before starting the sales we did provide

408
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,160
the press release and speaking about the

409
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,240
number of requests it has

410
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,519
increased by

411
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,519
from four or uh

412
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,399
eight times uh per week

413
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,079
but now we are in a situation that we

414
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,920
have entered this market very fast in a

415
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,079
number of pilot projects

416
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,360
every day we have meetings and we're

417
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,920
overloaded an average funnel

418
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,839
for the first quarter

419
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,000
in total money is on the level of half a

420
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,839
billion and this is a good money and

421
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,160
this is in our funnel yes this is in

422
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,560
market uh expression and speaking about

423
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,759
those clients who have been spending

424
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,519
budgets for these solutions and this is

425
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,120
a very good funnel considering the

426
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,880
situation that because of three months

427
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,520
we've been trying to

428
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,319
show ourselves somehow so half a half a

429
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,079
billion it's a funnel that has been

430
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,679
formed by us these are solutions that

431
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,280
have been purchased

432
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,079
and or we've been looking calculating

433
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,319
our own money and what about the total

434
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,919
market niche i think these are dozens of

435
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,319
billions of rubles yeah from the point

436
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,160
of view of

437
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,839
let's say movement

438
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,480
every year but we were not able to reach

439
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,840
everybody because

440
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,160
it still was the short period but by the

441
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,240
new autumn but the new release will

442
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,320
share with the market our success will

443
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,160
share our success with the market and

444
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,000
we'll see new numbers more interesting

445
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,160
numbers

446
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,520
from the point of view of product

447
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,400
readiness

448
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,559
the station is development it's a

449
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,200
readiness for beta testing pilots

450
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,120
implementation introduction what do you

451
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,039
think and how do you evaluate it

452
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,640
well right now i'd like to tell you that

453
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,960
the product is ready

454
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,840
for being sold actively

455
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,760
because this release happened a couple

456
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,480
of weeks ago and the product has been

457
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,480
rolled out on the positive

458
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,480
structure because the positive was the

459
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,160
active beta testers everything works

460
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,799
actively and speaking about the basic

461
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,360
set of products which is included into

462
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,000
the xcr in the first release and it was

463
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,880
the edr cm and the sandbox

464
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,000
and from the point of view of these

465
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,200
products

466
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,520
all modules are operational all

467
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,440
integrations are operational and there

468
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,520
are no problems the product is stable

469
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,760
and step-by-step basis in the roadmap we

470
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,440
have integration with our rest of the

471
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,799
portfolio

472
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,640
and in the nearest period it's going to

473
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,039
be integration with cti platform as igor

474
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,559
was speaking about by the end of this

475
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,600
year

476
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,960
it's going to be not an application

477
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,600
firewall in the second autumn release uh

478
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,000
between them we will have some minor uh

479
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,080
productions and for the next year i'll

480
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,240
see

481
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,720
do we use cloud connection between xdr

482
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,840
with some other clouds

483
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,240
russian foreign

484
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,160
well in the beginning

485
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,080
because technological platforms have

486
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,919
been developed for new technologies and

487
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,280
we do have a certain resilience compared

488
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,200
to those players who've been doing it

489
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,760
before us and agent solutions and server

490
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,600
solutions we can deploy this solution

491
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,918
in any way

492
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,960
hybrid

493
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,480
when you have the pool of products in

494
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,240
the cloud and we can assemble and

495
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,000
accumulate them but a question about

496
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,280
selecting the client there are examples

497
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,320
and we have it here and abroad with

498
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,559
dozens

499
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,240
of clients

500
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,799
with a small infrastructure up to 1000

501
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,600
agencies served by two three analytics

502
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,320
and one xdr solution

503
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,880
this is very

504
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,520
with a small number of people with big

505
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,080
analytical platform which allows us to

506
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,880
do everything from the phone line to

507
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,200
reaction on a specific note and we

508
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,880
include encoding and et cetera so it's

509
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,480
surprising because previously we didn't

510
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,280
have technologies like that

511
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,679
what is the other difference between the

512
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,400
so our technology what is the difference

513
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,240
and what is the similarity and can you

514
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,600
tell us about this technology well it's

515
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,200
a good question we've been asked very

516
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,240
often

517
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,640
because products and classes of

518
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,640
solutions they have common goals and

519
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,240
objectives for which they've been

520
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,640
developed because the main mission

521
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,760
is to

522
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,520
upload sock analytic and automate the

523
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,200
incident reaction

524
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,280
in order to achieve some level of

525
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,039
autonomousity of these objectives

526
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,640
and there's a lot of differences between

527
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,280
these products

528
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,600
so are security

529
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,280
orchestration

530
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,880
automated response

531
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,240
orchestration

532
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,799
and automation of the response

533
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:57,919
extra

534
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,799
extended detection and response and in

535
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,200
this names

536
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,600
is a conceptual difference

537
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,520
because if we speak about uh

538
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,120
it's an incident response platform

539
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,918
something similar

540
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,679
we speak about automation of the

541
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,200
reaction in these solutions we have

542
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
certain scenarios of reaction in the

543
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,480
playbook

544
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,799
however we don't have in-built tools for

545
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,720
these incidents and threats to be

546
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,559
discovered and xdr from this point of

547
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,120
view has a set of products and solutions

548
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,600
and certain

549
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,760
logic and channels of communication

550
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,200
between these products in order for them

551
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,280
to work together because the decision is

552
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,360
made in one product and uh reaction is

553
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,360
done in another product and it has to be

554
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,360
directed not only automation of the

555
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,120
reaction but also for the discovery of

556
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,960
threats it allows products to work

557
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,000
together

558
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,559
using strong sides of each other in

559
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,200
order to

560
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,360
make discovery faster and more effective

561
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,120
because without

562
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,678
agents

563
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,640
on the endpoints it's very difficult to

564
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,039
verify the attack especially when we

565
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,440
speak about the network attack which can

566
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,679
be detected by application firewall or

567
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,559
are not solution and very often we see

568
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,120
situations when due to the fact that uh

569
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,360
uh solution looks at the traffic and

570
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,440
there is a sign of attack

571
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,400
using the hacker instrumentary to check

572
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,320
that whether it was a successful attack

573
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,919
or not successful attack you have to go

574
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,600
to the workstation that was

575
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,720
participating as a victim of this and we

576
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,400
should discover what happened in this

577
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,799
station or in application server

578
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,400
speaking about application firewall and

579
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,720
in these cases availability of the end

580
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,280
point client helps us to check the

581
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,600
success of the attack and if nothing bad

582
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,240
has happened not putting the incident by

583
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,200
reducing the load against these things

584
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,320
and the second difference as a

585
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,559
conceptual one is the speed of reaction

586
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,799
because if we're speaking about uh solar

587
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,918
systems in order

588
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,600
to start the reaction following certain

589
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,960
playbook the information should be

590
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,200
collected from all the sources

591
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,039
worked and correlated and then it should

592
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,039
be delivered to the source solution

593
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,880
input and then it follows the plate book

594
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,159
and reaction but there could be

595
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,000
different problems available presumably

596
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,760
from some working station have not been

597
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,039
delivered because it was not in the

598
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,600
corporate network or maybe some were

599
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,760
we've accumulated the processing queue

600
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,760
and it creates a certain delays in this

601
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,720
case this could be very critical and if

602
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,200
we are speaking about xdr uh with the

603
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,440
help of the agent we can react to

604
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,640
something that episode the working

605
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,480
station at the endpoint at this moment

606
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,679
of time even being disconnected from

607
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,559
corporate network

608
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:43,840
because the agent has a certain

609
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,320
functionality which can be executed

610
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,600
offline locally and then in such a case

611
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,600
in the cm we are going to see not a new

612
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,080
incident but at the fact that xdr worked

613
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,760
the threat has been removed and final

614
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,960
question i have to you igor

615
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,320
xdr

616
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,159
is not a young technology

617
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,640
very competitive market

618
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,880
why do you think that positive will be

619
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,000
able to get established on this market

620
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,120
we

621
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,720
were always

622
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,159
able to get established in the markets

623
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,279
and speaking about analytics

624
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,919
you know coming back to the past a

625
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,200
little bit

626
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,400
you know we've been working with a lot

627
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,559
of different companies we know their

628
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,279
points application we know their pain

629
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,480
points etc so when we create solutions

630
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,720
traditional solutions and positive it's

631
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,279
based on analytics

632
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,039
before the entrance to the market

633
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,840
because we cannot take and make some

634
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,840
solution

635
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,279
which the client said well i would like

636
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,039
to classify documents or something like

637
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,600
that and we are just going to go and

638
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,520
move in this direction no we are

639
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,360
evaluating

640
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,400
possibilities of realization then how

641
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,000
it's going to work together with the

642
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,120
clients which functions will be used

643
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,400
and then we add our expertise that was

644
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,320
collected in 20 years of existence from

645
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,120
all the solutions

646
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,640
from expire small brother to global cm

647
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,799
systems that's why by making these

648
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,039
solutions we are confident in this

649
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,720
market and we're confident in our

650
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,039
expertise that will be given that will

651
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,000
help that will be able to react quickly

652
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,840
and push the competitors if they are

653
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,760
available if there are no competitors we

654
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,919
will take the niche

655
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,440
thank you for the interview so xdr is a

656
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,000
new solution which positive technologies

657
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,919
introduces to the market in this year

658
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,600
because of this year right now it's in

659
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,600
the stage when we are ready to provide

660
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,279
it to the clients and there's

661
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,200
multiplicity of reports and people

662
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,640
promise that we have commercial sales

663
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,120
because of this year

664
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,120
and they will be able to work

665
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,840
without this

666
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,799
solution technology

667
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,880
complex of well technological conflicts

668
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,520
of protection which allows us uh to make

669
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,360
inadmissible to become impossible it's

670
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,600
not going to be full because we need

671
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,919
class of solutions which provide

672
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,679
collection of the information from the

673
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,880
end devices from the endpoints laptops

674
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,600
desktops and servers and this is the

675
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,600
main reason why positive technology has

676
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,000
developed such a solution and along the

677
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,200
way it helps us to enter

678
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,120
very big market segment

679
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,559
and i wish you

680
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,880
