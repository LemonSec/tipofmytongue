1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:01,939
same previous

2
00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:05,959
hi everyone my name is

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,210
[Music]

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,540
organization

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,880
now I wanted to say a couple of words on

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,720
the changes that happens to very

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,300
technical conferences

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,699
uh in the last years Nikita doverkin is

9
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,920
going to connect to us remotely he is

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,960
the person who is looking for

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,719
presentations

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,480
for the Zone conferences my other guest

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,140
is Dmitry of the team of he organizes

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,739
zero nights and he is on the program

15
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,840
Committee of zero nights and the third

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,539
guest is Dmitry curielov who is one of

17
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,559
the key persons to collect the

18
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:55,020
presentations for crypta conference they

19
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,180
are the four best conferences technical

20
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,399
conferences in Russia and probably even

21
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,160
in the world so the question goes to

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,539
everyone

23
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,619
in the last two years since the outbreak

24
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,260
of covet and then the sanctions that

25
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,920
followed what changed in your perception

26
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,540
as people who are looking for

27
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,920
presentation the prison Nations got

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,280
better uh they got worse and they became

29
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,900
different let's start with uh

30
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:27,540
no it's uh it didn't get worse

31
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,200
especially creating certain vacuum our

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,060
communication and face-to-face

33
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,280
conferences once they became possible

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,040
they

35
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,680
provided a possibility for people who

36
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,479
were missing each other to see each

37
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,040
other usually a conference lasts

38
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,140
will repeat itself a year after year and

39
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,500
a conference is a platform where people

40
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,140
meet and they talk to each other and

41
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,219
they share the news so we now have just

42
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,020
one problem it's more difficult to bring

43
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,439
people from other countries but Russians

44
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,899
who love to travel to conferences they

45
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,580
are happy to do it and they also unhappy

46
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,679
to make presentations and they've got

47
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,500
well thanks to 2020 they've got things

48
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,060
that they want to talk about now

49
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,879
well first we need to go into the

50
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,739
background of zero nice first we had

51
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:24,360
three technical tracks on the main stage

52
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,980
of zero nights but about four years ago

53
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,260
we changed the format now we have only

54
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,200
one track on the main stage uh the main

55
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,900
track

56
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,019
that's why I mean what can I say to find

57
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:39,720
good technical content is now difficult

58
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,239
before the coverage and during the car

59
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,519
with no always I mean in all times

60
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:46,920
knowledge is good technical content has

61
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,080
always been a challenge even if you look

62
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,640
at the leading technical Western

63
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,099
conferences like a massive con or Recon

64
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:57,360
or power of community all of them that

65
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,239
you have just one track several days but

66
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,760
one track

67
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,340
which is good that means that everyone

68
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,800
can watch all presentations not miss

69
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,800
anything and also the presentations uh I

70
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,900
mean you need fewer presentations for

71
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,159
just one track good content uh

72
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,940
is worth called

73
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,379
if you're not mistaken your conference

74
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,840
when it was not a health night in 2020

75
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,260
and 2021 what about now

76
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,299
um what happens to your speakers this

77
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:31,260
time around

78
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,260
actually

79
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,560
we are the youngest

80
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,819
Conference of all present here and every

81
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:48,540
year and we are facing new challenges in

82
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,040
the first or second year of our

83
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,799
existence no one knew us and no one

84
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,780
wanted to come to us because no one knew

85
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,819
us

86
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,000
and then the third conference

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,400
we collected all the presentations they

88
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,140
were all in the Excel file

89
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,080
I remember Feeling So Satisfied looking

90
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,260
at this Excel file

91
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,040
and then we had to cancel the conference

92
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,239
and then I saw that some of these

93
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,839
presentations would be still made but uh

94
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,160
at other events and in other years

95
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,300
current conference

96
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,699
we haven't collected many presentations

97
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:34,199
only when the conference happens we'll

98
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,400
be able to say anything about the

99
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,560
content actually so yes we have a lot of

100
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,060
difficulties with International speakers

101
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,100
we are still not sure whether we would

102
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,240
like to try a remote uh speaker format

103
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,400
but I know that there are many people

104
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,840
who would love to come to an offline

105
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,180
conference and

106
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,720
um they

107
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,380
want to present they want you meet the

108
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,620
community

109
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,500
you twisted out of it you've managed to

110
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,100
have your confidence in 2020 and 2021

111
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,320
while the other three conferences were

112
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,000
not held in 2021

113
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,840
uh have you tried organizing an offline

114
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,820
completely offline events all our

115
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,240
speakers in November at the standoff

116
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,979
were offline they were remote and all

117
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,320
the viewers were remote you are talking

118
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,600
to the speakers and you help the content

119
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,539
reach the listener what do you think

120
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:44,479
about online presentations

121
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,900
let's start with you now

122
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,840
well I can say that organizers hates

123
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,460
online presentations because I mean you

124
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,319
have always trouble with the connection

125
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:01,020
there can be all kinds of failures and

126
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,660
statistically

127
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:07,340
people tend to watch less

128
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,419
presentations online just because they

129
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:10,979
know everything has been recruited they

130
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:13,680
can view the content later at every

131
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,380
conference the greatest value is a good

132
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,720
communication

133
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,819
on the margins of a conference then why

134
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:23,160
do we need to still a strong technical

135
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,780
content but there's still a strong

136
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,120
technical presenters attracts the

137
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,100
audience they attract high quality

138
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,199
audience that's why you really need a

139
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,060
strong technical content for the

140
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,039
conference to be attended by strong

141
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,100
participants well that's exactly how I

142
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,580
think I also believe that if you have

143
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:45,120
very good speakers on the side not not

144
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,460
on the list you know but on the side is

145
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,319
a great driver for the growth of the

146
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,580
community people will come to the

147
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,440
community they will come to the industry

148
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,740
they will uh develop the industry so

149
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,120
that's why I don't like online

150
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,240
presentations not not as an organizer

151
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,280
nor as a speaker myself when you speak

152
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,720
online it's a completely different

153
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,759
feeling when you talk to a camera at

154
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,560
your screen you do not feel any

155
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,080
vibrations from the audience what do you

156
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,780
think about online presentations yeah I

157
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,180
am even more critical of them than you

158
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:20,099
ruscript is uh with we I mean we started

159
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:24,680
uh back in the previous century and

160
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,599
we we are the probably the longest

161
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,060
standing uh annual conference in Russia

162
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,880
we we will the first event one of the

163
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,819
first event out of which this event uh

164
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:39,720
came out was held in 2010 the PHD was

165
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,960
the first and originally held at a rule

166
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,860
scripture conference so we are

167
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,020
grandfathers probably uh for the younger

168
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,500
generation but for us emotionally it's

169
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,960
more difficult to switch online it's

170
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,199
it's not working for us

171
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,759
I still believe that when you have a

172
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,790
good speaker

173
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:04,059
[Music]

174
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,840
who shares information that is valuable

175
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,080
for a larger audience well it still was

176
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,060
an effort but again you have to make an

177
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,860
effort you have to make a recording in a

178
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,599
good studio so that you can later

179
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,520
distribute the content along different

180
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,460
channels it can be done outside of a

181
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,020
conference you don't be the conference

182
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,440
for it right you can prepare content uh

183
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,180
you can ask different experts to do it

184
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,300
and then use it for Education use it for

185
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,779
training a good Studio can provide good

186
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,839
quality of the recording and an online

187
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:38,339
presentation will be difficult to

188
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:41,059
achieve the same kind of quality

189
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:44,880
so I'm all in favor of Studio recordings

190
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,459
if it's online then make a recording

191
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:48,779
it's not it will not be an online

192
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,279
presentation really it will be video

193
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,160
content that will share the good news

194
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,740
with the wider audience

195
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,720
you have any online speakers this year

196
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,600
through scripta yes we had French people

197
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,360
which right it didn't work well really

198
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,620
yeah we had speakers online so you have

199
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,500
the audience uh in the room and the

200
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,440
screen in the room we thought about this

201
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,540
format and then we decided against it we

202
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,339
saw that it was not comfortable for the

203
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,620
viewer what what sense does it make for

204
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,860
the participant you come to a room if

205
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,040
you can stay at home and pour yourself a

206
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,600
glass of wine and watch the video

207
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,399
recording well in our case it was not

208
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,860
possible it was an online offline event

209
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,959
the conference is special we we did not

210
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,980
make a recording it was um

211
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,240
presentation he organized the

212
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,580
competition for the participants who are

213
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,880
interested in cryptography it was a a

214
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,940
real-time competition really it was a an

215
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,480
opportunity to make a presentation using

216
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,720
video

217
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,540
presentation yeah the same with Eric's

218
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,399
here you can watch his presentation

219
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,160
online it was pre-recorded but we will

220
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,680
not be broadcasting Eric's presentation

221
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,600
today

222
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,700
or tomorrow here Nikita what do you

223
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,880
think about online speakers

224
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,800
in the past if a speaker cannot attend

225
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,140
for whatever reason the speaker is sick

226
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,540
the speaker cannot leave the location

227
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,360
for whatever reason ideal speaker as an

228
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,399
exception one speaker for a two-day

229
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,940
program maybe would be presenting online

230
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,019
what about this year what are your plans

231
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:37,500
you have any online presenters or I

232
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,160
trying to avoid that we are trying to

233
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,040
avoid that at the moment we have a list

234
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,959
of offline speakers

235
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,680
again a conference

236
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,920
it doesn't boil down to presentations

237
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,120
you need to give people an opportunity

238
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,240
to socialize

239
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,910
we organize the competition

240
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,079
[Music]

241
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,860
and during the finals

242
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,660
the teams played and with that we

243
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,300
decided to make an after party we did a

244
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,339
Discord we organized rooms where people

245
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:14,300
could uh talk to each other and

246
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,160
still we feel it was not enough

247
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,220
the teams were the homes and it wasn't

248
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,200
it wasn't very emotional if you know

249
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,620
what I mean

250
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,980
people people

251
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,899
were feeling kind of burnt out if you

252
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,200
know what I mean so we will do our best

253
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,000
you have an offline component to our

254
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,200
conference unless there are some

255
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,579
technical difficulties with bringing

256
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:40,320
people online

257
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,779
um I mean people couldn't travel or

258
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:44,820
whatever then of course we will make a

259
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,519
backup

260
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:50,040
and we will let people speak online but

261
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,459
we are aiming for an offline conference

262
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:56,220
thank you and now to go back to the

263
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,100
current the biggest current problem uh

264
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,260
for the Russian conferences foreign

265
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,680
speakers

266
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,130
foreign speakers on the Russian stage

267
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,639
[Music]

268
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,940
we have always been inviting foreign

269
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,639
speakers it's wonderful when uh people

270
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:20,519
from other countries can come you can

271
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,440
showcase your content they bring their

272
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,399
content uh

273
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:28,139
then it was difficult to fly and now

274
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:29,820
people are afraid of coming for

275
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:34,160
political reasons by the employers are

276
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,680
not letting people travel to Russia some

277
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,260
other people are just afraid of

278
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,779
traveling inside Russia and do not want

279
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:44,180
to come

280
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,540
how much will conferences lose

281
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,180
since we started to lose foreign

282
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:55,819
speakers we are going to lose a lot

283
00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:01,500
today I was looking at our program and I

284
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,100
saw that we didn't have any foreign

285
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,779
names and I know that in your program

286
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:08,700
you do not have many foreign names or

287
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,519
any foreign names

288
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:12,839
there are countries that are still

289
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:16,800
traveling to Russia like an Asia let's

290
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,959
rely on them I guess and and actually

291
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,060
one other thing about online

292
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,279
accelerated certain processes

293
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,079
uh I'd like to just give me a

294
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:28,810
um

295
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,859
[Music]

296
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,040
environmental processes you know that

297
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,560
some companies introduce Quarters on co2

298
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,660
emissions people are trying to fly less

299
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:44,060
not only for reasons of you know

300
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:48,859
traveling to particular destinations or

301
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,620
being infected with covet but you know

302
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,420
there are also environmental concerns

303
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,459
that stop people from traveling

304
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,600
speakers Did you have in earlier years

305
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,100
and how many do you have now at

306
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,980
rosecripter well there aren't that many

307
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,320
uh encryption Specialists who are

308
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,720
friends uh with the Russian Market well

309
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,540
usually the French in good old days we

310
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,399
also had the Chinese but they would

311
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,699
never they would never speak they would

312
00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:22,019
come but they would never speak in the

313
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:24,000
good old days but uh in recent years

314
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,920
mostly we had speakers from the CIS

315
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,459
because our conference is so special so

316
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:31,920
specialized in many cases cryptography

317
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,740
is equal to weapons and the countries

318
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,260
they have very little of their own

319
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,360
domestic cryptography that aren't

320
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,600
geopolitical aspects to the issue but

321
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,380
the you know the the Europeans we we had

322
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,300
Europeans at our conference never

323
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,399
Americans a couple of years ago there

324
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,800
was eurocrypt but no there was longer

325
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,500
than in the last five years

326
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,420
we've only had speakers and participants

327
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,480
from the CIS and also we had French

328
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,540
guests but it would be wonderful people

329
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,600
if cryptography would be somehow

330
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,440
Reloaded

331
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,040
would be resurrected you you can't be

332
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,260
isolated you can't be isolating yourself

333
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,639
forever it's a dead end

334
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,100
we had about 70 of all the speakers at

335
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,860
our first conference from foreign lands

336
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,500
we have always tried to make sure that

337
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,839
we would have more uh Russian speakers

338
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:39,360
as well what we wanted to have more

339
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,899
researchers in Russia and here after a

340
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,699
year we started to receive more

341
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:46,740
interesting and strong technical content

342
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,680
and they share of Russian speakers grew

343
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,420
year on year we were happy about that

344
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,699
it's difficult with Logistics and

345
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:57,740
everything to bring in foreign speakers

346
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:01,380
we did not have a single foreign speaker

347
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,440
we were offline no one could travel we

348
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,139
postponed it several times we planned to

349
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:09,000
have international speakers but then

350
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,920
they couldn't come and then we decided

351
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,000
against off online

352
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,300
is a bad thing and usually you would

353
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,279
like to see another person's perspective

354
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,839
you want to see the perspective of other

355
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:27,839
Specialists offline communication you

356
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,399
learn a lot you're in offline

357
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:35,779
oh I hope it will not last

358
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
our confidence has a good reputation in

359
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,980
the world Russian Engineers have always

360
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,920
been valued internationally they too

361
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,480
wants to exchange their experience not

362
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,000
like they come here and only give off

363
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,279
their experience they learn as well and

364
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,800
we we always invite the translators they

365
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,440
support our conferences

366
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,339
okay we only have a couple of minutes

367
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:05,939
left so it means 30 seconds per each of

368
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:09,079
you per each speaker

369
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:16,020
is content hunger is what lies ahead

370
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,980
I don't think so

371
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,020
I'm very happy that in the last year we

372
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,520
also saw changes on the gender

373
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,140
composition of the conference people

374
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,500
notice that we have many more wonderful

375
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,120
girls

376
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,340
who are now into cryptography and

377
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,679
systems

378
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,039
programming and a very high-end

379
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:42,240
information security we have many more

380
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,960
women now

381
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,059
speaking and attending in our conference

382
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:51,600
maybe it's my age speaking at the moment

383
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,120
but I now see more and more beautiful

384
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,820
girls around me

385
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,160
no I do not think that there will be any

386
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,020
content hunger conferences Food For

387
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,660
Thought I agree there won't be any

388
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,000
content uh hunger there will be more

389
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,340
work there will be more research areas

390
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,220
the industry is making progress and

391
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,500
there is clouds there is you know all

392
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,059
kinds of Technologies there are all

393
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:16,980
kinds of things that you can read first

394
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,980
that you can study that you can

395
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,240
investigate no I do not expect any

396
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,679
problems Nikita what do you think

397
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,580
okay I'll be this capsicum on you

398
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,640
yeah I think that

399
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,440
in the next year or two years we are

400
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,740
going to fall back

401
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:40,320
that will fall down rather and we'll

402
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,900
have to set it off with internal

403
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,700
resources and additional content but the

404
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,799
industry is expanding and I'm sure that

405
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,799
the number of quality high quality

406
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,460
presentations will increase

407
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,799
let me try to summarize what you've said

408
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,440
in the last uh say three minutes so yes

409
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,200
we had problems due to covet yes we

410
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,820
still have problems with foreign

411
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,280
speakers International speakers but we

412
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,960
now have our own content it's getting

413
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,880
better here on here there is some

414
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,580
content hunger but uh this will be

415
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,580
overcome and the future is bright and we

416
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,080
will continue organizing action

417
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,340
conferences and bringing in

418
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,700
um wonderful participants and share the

419
