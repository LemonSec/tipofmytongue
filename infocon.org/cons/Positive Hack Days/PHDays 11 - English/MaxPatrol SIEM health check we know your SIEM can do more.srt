1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,600
let's try making this report interesting

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,440
so together we retire my name is

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,200
vladimir veloson i work for positive

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,400
technologists this is alexandra stipana

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,320
and he is going to bear the brunt of the

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,400
second part of our report so let's get

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,400
going um our plan

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,760
is to tell you about uh using max petrol

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,880
cm and making the most out of it and in

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,480
particular we'll tell about max patrol

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,359
cm health track

12
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,640
so listed here are the notions i guess

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,960
you all know very well such as you know

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,280
logs and dashboards and health

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,360
monitoring notifications if you have

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,079
worked with the max petrol cm or in fact

17
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,840
most other cms

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,960
you wouldn't be surprised

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,199
so for example

20
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,840
i should probably comment on health

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,760
monitoring notifications but this

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,199
notifications

23
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,600
you will learn about the current

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,320
breakdowns or errors

25
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,479
so it's effectively a traffic light

26
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,799
system

27
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,840
showing the current condition of

28
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,840
your landscape

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,479
the configuration checklist

30
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,799
should enable you to

31
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,439
run your system configure your system in

32
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,200
an optimal way

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,960
it will walk you

34
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,799
step by step through the configuration

35
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,119
process and will help you

36
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,200
around your system in the way that was

37
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,200
designed by the developer

38
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,400
which i guess happens to be us

39
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,880
there are also other things such as

40
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,280
source monitoring configuration files

41
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,280
various logs and statistics

42
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,280
what they have all in common is that

43
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,560
they're all designed to help you control

44
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,280
the performance

45
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,399
however when you use them individually

46
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,280
and separately you will not

47
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,360
be able to benefit from a holistic

48
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,200
approach

49
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,480
it's important to know how to

50
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,959
properly interpret the data the system

51
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,280
provides

52
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,360
so if you apply this useful tools

53
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,520
selectively

54
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,400
and sparingly you will not be able

55
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,200
to provide a comprehensive answer to the

56
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,040
question about whether your system is

57
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,519
running correctly

58
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,800
it's natural for infrastructure to go

59
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,440
through change

60
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,800
how efficient is our system

61
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,120
do we really provide for proper

62
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,840
monitoring and incident response

63
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,360
that all these questions are

64
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,879
kind of abstract that in fact cm

65
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,319
is a root level system for incident

66
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,800
monitoring and response which means that

67
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,239
you need

68
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,360
to view it comprehensively and apply all

69
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,280
the tools provided

70
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,920
that's why we came up with a product

71
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,040
called max petrol cm health check

72
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,799
it is effectively a set of technical and

73
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,560
organizational checks

74
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,720
which supports you know a proper

75
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,599
holistic checkup that should help you

76
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,879
better

77
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,440
withstand

78
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,120
what it includes

79
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,760
well process analysis architecture

80
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,680
assessment component functional check

81
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,760
availability and sufficiency of

82
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,439
resources false positives analysis

83
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,480
update process overview

84
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,399
and connected sources monitoring

85
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,239
instruments

86
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,760
so we started by looking at all the

87
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,680
tools available in you know the

88
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,279
off-the-shelf solution we didn't really

89
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,358
add much to it

90
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,160
but

91
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,479
we asked ourselves how can our clients

92
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,680
best use the user most efficiently

93
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,440
we took into account the experience

94
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,160
of the technical support division of our

95
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,560
analysts

96
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,899
[Music]

97
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,440
we also were able to identify these

98
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,600
sources of data

99
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,400
that should provide the most precise

100
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,639
answers and we got a list

101
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,080
of initial checks over 100 in total that

102
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,320
we built into this tool

103
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,919
as we felt that we had to rely primarily

104
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,280
on them

105
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,800
to come up with

106
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,039
a reliable answer

107
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,000
for a top level assessment

108
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,360
you probably will not want to see really

109
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,759
the results from each of the 1 20 checks

110
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,240
we decided to aggregate this check

111
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,080
results

112
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,479
next we described assessment criteria

113
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,039
and the applicability scope naturally in

114
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,199
different infrastructures you will need

115
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,880
different tools

116
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,680
and some tools will not really be

117
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,120
applicable

118
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,039
and on something that's not applicable

119
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,400
claiming that you have failed a

120
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,280
particular check makes little sense

121
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,080
next

122
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,840
we

123
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,919
did data collection and we did its

124
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,960
preliminary analysis of results

125
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,199
which showed that some checks

126
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,240
are redundant and others are in fact

127
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,000
extraneous so we came up with a

128
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,639
finalized list

129
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,680
the total number of sources we're

130
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,039
tracking is obviously below 120.

131
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,360
so in order to minimize the number of

132
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,720
requests

133
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,160
we optimize the process

134
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,720
so we came up with the right sequence

135
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,560
for this checks to be performed

136
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,080
naturally

137
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,039
we didn't want to do it all manually

138
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,880
that's why we developed automation

139
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,720
scripts

140
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,800
and they also did some pre-processing of

141
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,280
the results

142
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,840
it was also important to prioritize the

143
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,000
results of these checks

144
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,520
and our observations

145
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,440
naturally i'm talking about the checks

146
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,680
that were failed by the system

147
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,680
or those that returned issues

148
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,599
naturally some things need to be

149
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,680
resolved

150
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,759
as a first priority while others can

151
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,560
afford to wait

152
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,039
for every inspection item we provided

153
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,520
our own recommendations

154
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,800
we prepared reported a presentation

155
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,479
i will cover it's an additional detail

156
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,160
later but the big update is that there

157
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,400
is a technical report there is also a

158
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,120
top tier presentation for the

159
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,639
executives an executive summary

160
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,039
effectively so this is what

161
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,919
a check can return so you see there are

162
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,000
fills there so we are showing what was

163
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,479
being checked the name of the check

164
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,759
for example

165
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,840
component availability check source of

166
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,440
information see that it's a particular

167
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,520
log health monitoring log

168
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,520
that we are parsing with the help of

169
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,479
automation scripts

170
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,879
i'm also showing here a specific

171
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,120
response from the system that may be a

172
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,039
trigger

173
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,280
solution also we are showing here some

174
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,080
top level assessment criteria in

175
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,240
particular here it says that you know

176
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,960
that you know the result is not okay

177
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,960
because a particular component was not

178
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,800
available

179
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,280
and the reason for that is that you know

180
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,360
this particular component was not

181
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,719
updated from version 24 0 to 24.1 and

182
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,159
since the certificates were not

183
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,599
compatible we lost connection

184
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,519
you know as we assess the performance of

185
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,000
the system

186
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,880
we try to say if the issues we have

187
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,000
discovered

188
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,760
can be resolved

189
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,000
on the spot

190
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
now in real life it may be different if

191
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,600
it's a production system for example

192
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,680
or if for example resolution will

193
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,360
require a lot of time or a lot of

194
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,920
signups

195
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,120
so what you see here is a technical

196
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,519
draft of the report

197
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,519
so we're also listing the actions we've

198
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,880
already taken to address it

199
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,640
fall into the following categories

200
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,360
resources architecture monitoring

201
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,000
expertise infrastructure configuration

202
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,760
updates licenses and processes

203
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,120
many categories in fact

204
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,839
assessing each of these areas

205
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,839
indeed helps us come up with a

206
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,600
comprehensive

207
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,920
system

208
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,680
so we have as a final product we have a

209
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,160
check matrix and assessment criteria

210
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,800
determine sources or identified sources

211
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
for analysis

212
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,320
also a catalog of recommendations for

213
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,680
at least you know most common situations

214
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,600
also tools and methods for data

215
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,040
collection

216
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,920
so that you know we know what it is that

217
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,640
we are using what kind of data

218
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,000
we are requesting

219
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,680
for all these checks

220
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,479
and in order for this

221
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,480
is results

222
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,440
to be easy to read and systemic

223
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,640
we have developed templates for reports

224
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,560
for two types of users like i said

225
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,560
general numbers in the bottom of the

226
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,880
slides

227
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,959
depicts what it is that we're tracking

228
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,399
number of sources

229
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,120
number of areas

230
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
so in practice we took two experts a

231
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,560
technical expert and a consultant

232
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,279
each had his own role

233
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,399
the tacky

234
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,560
naturally was responsible for manual

235
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,399
checks doing you know running the

236
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,240
scripts doing technical assessments

237
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,320
and uh drafting the observation report

238
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,160
and he also prioritized them by

239
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,800
criticality

240
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,000
like i said previously

241
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,720
the same person could also introduce

242
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,680
some

243
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,240
improvements on the fly if it was clear

244
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,040
how to fix it

245
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,079
if it could not be fixed on the fly he

246
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,160
proposed his recommendations

247
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,800
and then the consultant

248
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,000
would also check for proper process

249
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,480
coverage

250
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,480
his recommendations for individual

251
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,200
processes all this would be consolidated

252
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,120
in the report

253
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,480
and the reports

254
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,959
can look like this i hope it's readable

255
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,959
yes

256
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,680
so naturally the report for technical

257
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,800
experts will provide um

258
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,279
a lot of detailed figures and

259
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,200
we've made it unreadable because

260
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,079
otherwise it would be too sensitive

261
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,160
but you can still see that you know it

262
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,720
shows the assessment criteria it

263
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,040
provides prioritization it explains what

264
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,319
has been done and what hasn't

265
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,639
yet

266
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,040
in these

267
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,560
so you will see that everything is fine

268
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,959
in some of them but not the others it

269
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,720
also proposes

270
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,160
some

271
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,100
uh rapid improvements

272
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,210
[Music]

273
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,360
and further improvement areas

274
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,399
things that we have not been able to do

275
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,120
and things that will require some

276
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,880
executive

277
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,920
support

278
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,440
and the technical aspects will be

279
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,320
covered by my colleague here

280
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,560
so you may have heard about extended

281
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,800
technical support division this is where

282
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,120
i work

283
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,000
so in cm health check for cm health

284
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,600
check we do the technical part of the

285
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,440
operation so let me walk you through the

286
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,160
details of it

287
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,720
i think it makes sense for me to start

288
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,959
the analysis with the health monitoring

289
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,440
and for that we already have some

290
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,279
inbuilt functions such as health

291
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,480
monitoring

292
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,000
those who don't know the system i should

293
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,160
probably explain that it's a dedicated

294
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,920
service that will monitor the state of

295
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,120
other services it will also monitor

296
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,800
the state of the resources

297
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,839
it will also

298
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,760
inform inform the administrator of

299
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,480
availability of new packages in fact you

300
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,600
know it is a helpful

301
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,639
provider of reminders to the admin

302
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,639
in the interface you can see the green

303
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,360
light like here like now where it can be

304
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,680
yellow or red depending on the level of

305
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,000
threat so to speak and you will also see

306
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,170
error messages if it's not green

307
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:55,420
[Music]

308
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,399
and email notifications may be pulled up

309
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,440
here

310
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,680
thoughts you know ssi suggests they

311
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,440
maybe you know they may fail to be

312
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,519
configured so to speak

313
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,720
and uh

314
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,880
this is what a regular log

315
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,800
would look like in health monitoring so

316
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,279
we started parsing it

317
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,800
and we found something that you probably

318
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,720
cannot make out in my slide so let me

319
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,760
just uh read it out or other quotes from

320
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,279
my memory

321
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,959
so we parsed the results you know we

322
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,079
produce regular expressions

323
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,560
we're looking for a source and we see

324
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,079
errors here related to various failures

325
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,199
now if you have a cane eyesight

326
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,839
you may have noticed that there are 186

327
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,639
search results

328
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,759
a particular yellow mistake was uh

329
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,720
discovered at 1722 and

330
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,839
in fact resolved at 1723.

331
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,040
was because elasticsearch was not really

332
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,040
available and this is a minor one

333
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,880
because you know elasticsearch was uh

334
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,279
trying to sort of i'm sorry somebody

335
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,720
sent a

336
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,279
bulky request and elasticsearch did not

337
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,639
respond in time because of that

338
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,120
it actually shows that you know we want

339
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,040
to see information and areas of the past

340
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,639
30 days we want to see them

341
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,720
classified

342
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,639
and we also may want to know how long it

343
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,720
took us to respond to them

344
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,639
and it would be useful for us to see

345
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,800
only the errors that took over 10

346
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,880
minutes to address

347
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,480
this is where automation comes in handy

348
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,480
we set the time difference between

349
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,800
issue discovery and issue resolution at

350
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,720
600 seconds

351
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,720
then we indicate i want to see all

352
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,839
errors classified by type

353
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,319
and well the second one actually shows

354
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,880
how many errors we had of this type

355
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,199
so total number of this you know major

356
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,160
errors

357
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,919
was 57 over 30 days 57 is not much we

358
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,640
can check them all that's why next to

359
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,439
the script you know we actually generate

360
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,079
a pretty detailed report as a csv file

361
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,640
so it's very easy to transform into an

362
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,200
excel file

363
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,160
so let's see what we can actually find

364
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,480
in a single day a single day of hard

365
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,760
work at cm

366
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,720
the morning starts at 5 52.

367
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,880
the company

368
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:48,880
space

369
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,400
is

370
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,400
close to depletion at the core level

371
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,880
this is a worn level notification we

372
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,360
still have time to address it to delete

373
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,320
information unneeded

374
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,160
we see that this issue was resolved

375
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,039
within 750.

376
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,360
so apparently

377
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,120
this issue is no more

378
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,919
between these messages there were alerts

379
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,600
about some linux agents

380
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,120
now please note that here we're getting

381
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,240
three alerts per event and in the source

382
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,120
column we see the id of the agent so we

383
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,280
see that we have actually two linux

384
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,799
agents which experience the same issue

385
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,080
and the action type column shows that

386
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,880
it was resolved and then created and if

387
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,039
you track it down you'll see was

388
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,960
resolved again

389
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,320
at 8 28.

390
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,200
fun part starts you know enricher

391
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,360
correlator and elastic search become

392
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,840
unavailable

393
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,559
tells us that the key limit has been

394
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,480
reached which means that the system has

395
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,360
become unavailable

396
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,799
next we start running out of the core

397
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,200
space

398
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,919
he has become critical no space left

399
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,240
do not treat the team

400
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,520
at 12 37 life seems to be coming back to

401
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,120
normal

402
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,480
correlator

403
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,240
enricher and elastic search issues have

404
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,760
been resolved

405
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,120
so we see that the system has

406
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,760
effectively been down for four hours

407
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,869
[Music]

408
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,000
well we are still processing the data

409
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,600
that was accumulated in the agent cache

410
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,240
so we see here flow controls sticking

411
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,600
kicking in

412
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,360
and this is

413
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,240
a dude as we have in order to

414
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,960
balance the load really sure so it's

415
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,880
effectively telling the system it's okay

416
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,960
you know i'm managing it

417
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,159
i will finish soon so between 13 and

418
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,600
1700

419
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,280
you know we were processing whatever

420
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,240
there was in the cache

421
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,840
and the remaining errors shown

422
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,360
the problem with the agent has not

423
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,520
really been resolved you know it's an

424
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,799
intermittent issue

425
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,000
that is four hours

426
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,720
of the system uh downtime

427
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,400
were due to well initially agreed upon

428
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,080
disk replacement

429
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,000
but the problem with the agent is for

430
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,159
real

431
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,400
and indeed at critical moments

432
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,799
discs may experience a discs in the core

433
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,280
may experience lack of space so this is

434
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,919
something that needs to be addressed

435
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,919
i'm not going to tell you about all the

436
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,159
aspects that we address with this system

437
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,520
that would actually require too much

438
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,200
time more than we have but uh let me

439
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,720
cover the stuff that we consider

440
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,240
particularly important

441
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,840
one of this actually includes

442
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,919
infrastructure coverage

443
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,919
in order to answer this question

444
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,840
we actually have a preliminary

445
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,039
questionnaire

446
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,679
and we also interview the client about

447
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,080
the potential data sources that need to

448
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,520
be connected to the cm infrastructure

449
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,440
can we also ask him about

450
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,280
the scope of infrastructure will be

451
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,720
servers or workstations

452
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,679
so we have this entity called an asset

453
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,919
so for every server on the network there

454
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,480
will be an asset on cm this asset is

455
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
unique

456
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,080
which means that the number of these

457
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,280
assets

458
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,760
corresponds more or less

459
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,720
to the amount of infrastructure coverage

460
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,000
and the amount of knowledge we have

461
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,640
about the system

462
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,240
so this assets uh can actually be

463
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,039
created uh following discovery or even

464
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,200
pen testing exercise or they can also be

465
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,919
imported from other documents such as

466
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,440
say documents generated by max patrol 8

467
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,480
or from csv fonts

468
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,200
it will be difficult for us to read the

469
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,200
list

470
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,320
this is where the function for you know

471
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,480
classifying comes in handy because we

472
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,000
can do the domain controller grouping

473
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,080
more classified by windows and linux and

474
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,399
so on

475
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,120
the more experience you are the more

476
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,600
different ways of classification you can

477
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,158
actually do

478
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:00,960
the next one

479
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,400
is analysis of the task list for data

480
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,240
scanning and collection actually this

481
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,880
list can tell you which of the sources

482
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,799
has been connected and what it is that

483
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,400
we are collecting

484
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,559
and scanning and how stable data

485
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,120
collection is

486
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,280
we may want to have you know the proper

487
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,679
schedule for data collection and if we

488
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,840
have identified any particular

489
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,880
critical data sources

490
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,520
then certainly we shouldn't see its

491
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,720
status

492
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,960
in the dashboard as you know completed

493
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,200
with errors

494
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,640
item is source monitoring sort of builds

495
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,159
in the previous one

496
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,520
the idea here is that uh we can actually

497
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,080
look in more detail at the critical

498
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,200
sources

499
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,720
for which we will want to have alerts

500
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,000
telling us for example that you know ebs

501
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,760
has dropped down for a particular source

502
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,480
so we're not getting any events from

503
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,720
particular sources

504
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,000
another life hack

505
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,159
straight from the box so to speak is a

506
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,880
configuration checklist

507
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,600
this checklist is effectively a set of

508
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,520
checks across three domains such as

509
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,880
administration infrastructure and

510
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,159
expertise

511
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,760
which should help the administrator

512
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,559
learn more about the products

513
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,320
significant event sources so assets need

514
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,320
to be added to the system this is check

515
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,679
one

516
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,600
key elements of infrastructure need to

517
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,679
be clearly identified

518
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,159
level of criticality should be assigned

519
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,960
for such assets

520
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,600
if a given asset is a source of security

521
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,279
events and we're already collecting

522
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,120
information off it

523
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,440
then it makes sense to set up some event

524
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,799
monitoring for this source

525
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,480
we'll also establish some alerts for eps

526
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,120
drops for example

527
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,120
and if something goes wrong

528
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,240
we should be cheaply notified

529
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,000
this kind of track will not be

530
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,679
considered past

531
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,000
if alerts have been set up and at the

532
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,159
same time they are not complying with

533
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,760
serious people

534
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,799
not even worse

535
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,520
it's important to realize however

536
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,279
that it's uh you know effectively a

537
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,600
helper in the product setup

538
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,279
it should help you understand how to

539
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,919
best do it

540
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,039
we will also care about the total number

541
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,360
of uh

542
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,000
critical sources identified and how

543
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,600
you exercise controls there

544
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,120
let's talk about expertise because i

545
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,960
think this could be a critically

546
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,120
important subject so this is an

547
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,159
exploration of what we believe needs to

548
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,320
be

549
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,559
so we have this ucs component of the

550
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,720
update servers

551
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,960
well it needs uh to bring

552
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,240
it needs to provide up-to-date expertise

553
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,480
packages which need to be installed just

554
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,720
installing them is not good enough

555
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,400
and they also need to know what they're

556
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,480
about and they contain installation

557
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,799
guidelines

558
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,440
you know when you have started them

559
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,440
you can perform additional actions such

560
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,080
as you know setting up table lists

561
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,440
you can also populate them with

562
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,360
additional assets

563
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,679
for example you can get you can grab

564
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,080
sysmon or extended audit

565
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,840
you know they naturally require

566
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,360
additional setup additional

567
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,440
configuration to provide

568
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,400
reliable data

569
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,080
next we do assessment of cyber security

570
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,559
events available to cm

571
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,559
now as many sources as can we as you

572
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,120
potentially should be connected to cm

573
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,960
right but you know some of them probably

574
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,559
would not be supported by a particular

575
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,000
vendor

576
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,440
for example

577
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,760
you may have

578
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,320
you know some specialized industrial

579
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,520
system

580
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,600
which will provide very useful

581
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,600
information

582
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,440
in order to connect it to cm if such

583
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,240
interface is not supported by the vendor

584
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,840
you may need to do some magic for

585
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,399
example it may be storing information in

586
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,480
an sql database

587
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,159
done you know if you do an sql query

588
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,240
you can actually pull this information

589
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,440
to your cm system

590
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,919
it doesn't stop there

591
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,360
the next step

592
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,760
is normalization correlation and

593
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,399
enrichment

594
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,120
the stuff coming from the vendor

595
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,600
will not be good enough not because the

596
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,120
vendor is bad

597
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,200
but because your infrastructure will

598
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,279
have its own peculiarities

599
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,600
well just like any infrastructure well i

600
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,200
guess

601
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,440
there will be for example the list of 80

602
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,240
servers who can do that about you

603
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,000
it's just a system administrator he

604
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,960
should be able to do that

605
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,360
so once you've done that we started

606
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,559
monitoring for events

607
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,520
there will be some false reports some

608
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,799
false alerts false positives in order to

609
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,480
avoid them you will need to work on the

610
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,799
rules

611
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,760
going back to my previous example

612
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,640
if you want to see incidents occurring

613
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,240
on your particular system

614
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,279
needs to configure special rules and

615
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:21,120
that also requires some expertise

616
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,960
now we will see if we can actually help

617
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,679
you

618
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,159
in this particular respect when it comes

619
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,159
for example to your diagnostics

620
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,720
monitoring a control system and we've

621
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,080
got our own

622
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,200
courses

623
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,600
for interested clients and we can also

624
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,120
help you

625
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,159
with the writing normalization and

626
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,279
correlation rules

627
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,360
you know it best works when the client

628
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,080
really wants it

629
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:49,840
next step

630
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,919
is about ensuring the quality of data

631
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,880
you collect and process

632
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,080
we may have say ebs of 30 000 but how

633
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,240
many of these events

634
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,159
actually matter for analysis

635
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,600
the normalization percentage is an

636
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,159
important criterion here we should

637
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,240
strive for 70

638
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,919
and if we don't get there we need to

639
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,640
analyze this crap and says collecting a

640
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,399
lot of traffic and doing nothing about

641
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,279
it makes little sense

642
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,960
i think this really shows the amount of

643
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,399
expertise we have right

644
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,240
you will need to know a lot about

645
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,440
filtration

646
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,520
and different companies have different

647
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,799
sets of tools and different methods for

648
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,279
identifying attacks for example

649
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,679
finally you will need a decent process

650
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,720
for incident response

651
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,480
actually when we're talking incidents

652
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,480
here

653
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,159
that you know an incident is a

654
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,559
potentially bad event you know if we do

655
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,159
not respond to something that's

656
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,080
potentially bad

657
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,240
that paints us in a pretty dreary light

658
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,000
false positives also need to be

659
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,919
addressed

660
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,120
attack

661
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,600
and detection of new techniques and

662
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,480
tactics of attacks

663
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,039
is also a must have function for every

664
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,399
what are we focusing on

665
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,880
yes and i think everybody can can do it

666
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,039
if they have a cm

667
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,720
in the statistics tab

668
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,000
like this we will be looking at for

669
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,840
example

670
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,039
this slides

671
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,679
here we see that two rules have been

672
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:02,720
triggered

673
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,720
seven thousand and twenty seven thousand

674
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,760
times in a day which is a bit too much

675
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,000
we actually believe that if earl is

676
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,840
triggered over four thousand times per

677
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,120
day well this certainly warrants

678
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,320
analyzing

679
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,039
them for false positives and for

680
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,720
integrity of the rules

681
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,960
the second thing that actually draws our

682
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,480
attention is

683
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,120
suspended correlation rules we see that

684
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,039
four rules have been suspended the big

685
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,120
question is how long they've been like

686
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,480
this this is something that the

687
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,799
monitoring

688
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,559
section should show

689
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,320
you know if they have been stopped for a

690
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,880
day and the administrator is not doing

691
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,519
anything you know

692
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,120
triggers a bunch of questions for the

693
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,439
admin

694
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,399
actually this whole system was designed

695
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,240
to help us better deal with false

696
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,240
positives

697
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,559
now we do have a system uh called

698
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:05,039
correlation rule performance monitoring

699
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,960
and this system actually suggests that

700
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,480
you know something may be wrong with the

701
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,480
correlation rule here would you like to

702
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,039
check it and change it

703
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,360
and you know some administrators you

704
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,480
know may

705
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,399
feel lazy and they will just switch it

706
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:19,440
off and

707
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,559
we actually don't think it's a good

708
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,519
idea so the criterion here is that it

709
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,080
has to be on

710
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,960
and suspended correlation rules you know

711
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,440
should be reacted to should be responded

712
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,320
to

713
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,720
and all rules that get triggered over 4

714
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,760
000 times a day should be

715
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,600
thoroughly analyzed

716
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,159
and finally we will be looking at

717
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:49,600
correlator and enricher logs for errors

718
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,519
and we may find there say elements of

719
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,840
codes or attempts at insertion in the

720
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,440
table list

721
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,320
so for example

722
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,440
you know a string being inserted

723
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,799
in an int type column would certainly

724
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,840
generate an error

725
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,879
now

726
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,280
architecture and scaling i think we

727
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,480
should start with aps analysis

728
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,839
as well as monitoring of uh the way that

729
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,759
event flow gets processed

730
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,879
is a sample

731
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,199
chart

732
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,599
the aggregate for all modules

733
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,399
so we can see that until 8 am the system

734
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,079
was up and running

735
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,720
then we had four hour long downtime

736
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,079
and after that the system was actually

737
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,000
addressing the tasks in the cache

738
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,599
it's interesting how the system worked

739
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,120
in this uh stress mode

740
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,480
[Music]

741
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,720
so naturally there is some flow control

742
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,119
that smoothes this

743
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:20,240
charts and we can see that at 1830

744
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,040
isis syslog and win event log starting

745
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,560
going down

746
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,880
while another lock started going up

747
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,560
it probably shows that the traffic of

748
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,480
syslog is much lighter

749
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,599
so it shows that you know resources

750
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,040
available to safelord

751
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,000
provided higher performance effectively

752
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,839
and this is when

753
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,520
pbs shot above 30 000

754
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,160
it also shows that you know

755
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,880
making judgment calls on simplistic

756
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,160
criteria such as eps

757
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,599
let's continue this discussion of

758
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,720
architecture and performance analysis

759
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,000
so we will be checking here ebs flow and

760
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,400
agent level loads

761
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,320
now that we're looking at agents we also

762
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,960
need to check their caches

763
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,880
you will probably know that we have data

764
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,040
cache in sql

765
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,280
which can grow

766
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,000
so we will need to check the file size

767
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,320
in the private folder

768
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,400
and then we can

769
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,880
create filters

770
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,880
behind the actual time of events

771
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,599
for example we may realize that we have

772
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,440
too strong a flow of events from a

773
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,280
particular module or maybe the

774
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,880
configuration of the module is

775
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,320
suboptimal

776
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,880
and needs to be revisited

777
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,960
next one is configuration and load

778
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,320
management at cpu ram and disk level

779
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,480
so naturally we will check here if it's

780
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,000
in line with minimum hardware

781
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,560
requirements

782
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,359
we'll also check if it is working fine

783
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:23,599
we'll also be checking for

784
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,359
loads it's actually a sizeable item

785
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,200
because we'll also be looking at the

786
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,119
configuration of

787
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,520
logical drives and the stuff you have in

788
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,759
the system

789
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,599
and if the system of uh monitoring is uh

790
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,680
properly configured we can also do

791
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,118
retrospective analysis

792
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,160
and there we can also check if there

793
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,760
have been any data leaks for example and

794
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,839
how the system performed in a stress

795
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:54,720
mode

796
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,800
when for example a particular source

797
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,560
started spamming us with information

798
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,200
with this data we will be looking for

799
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,760
bottlenecks in our architecture and in

800
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,680
our performance

801
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,200
next item is configuration files

802
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,520
and this one deals with bottlenecks and

803
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,920
tuning so we've got configuration files

804
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,200
and they contain you know default values

805
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,919
we can actually

806
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,839
overclock the system

807
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:26,960
but

808
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,720
if we change these values but we need to

809
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,720
be careful when doing that

810
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,520
so it's also a way of improving the

811
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,560
operation of the product next one is

812
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,440
asset processing statistics now

813
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,119
this feature is available starting from

814
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,000
release 24 and it shows how we are

815
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,720
processing data on discovered assets and

816
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,240
if we have any performance issues

817
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,200
well say we've done substantial analysis

818
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,760
on the network naturally this means

819
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,079
we'll need a lot of time to process it

820
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,079
and then we should be able to assess the

821
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:06,240
speed and results i will speed up

822
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,040
next one is

823
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,440
size of postgres basis

824
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,640
and availability of backup copies so if

825
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,320
uh

826
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,440
if a database is over 150 gigabytes well

827
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,720
naturally

828
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,800
we will need to do something about it

829
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,359
and also check for errors

830
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,599
and also we need to check for a backup

831
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,200
copy so because you know still

832
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,839
we'd need to do core backups at least

833
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,320
once a month

834
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,800
next one is uh checking elastic search

835
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,920
index

836
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,640
and size of the daily index

837
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,000
so the big question here is how much

838
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,760
we're storing inelastic and how much we

839
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,200
want to store in elasticsearch

840
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,240
now the cool data for example data over

841
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,799
in 90 days

842
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,640
you know data like this is uh usually

843
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,119
relevant for analysis purposes you know

844
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,040
most business uses you'll want to

845
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,040
compare what you're having today to what

846
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,839
you had a week ago or a month ago but 90

847
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:12,000
days old information is rarely relevant

848
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,240
so you should go to an archive so this

849
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,520
is where you would also want to check

850
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,760
how your archiving processes work how

851
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,920
they're configured

852
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,960
and you can also see here what's

853
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,119
capacity is still available in the

854
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,359
system this is it for the technical part

855
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,040
let me tell you about what we're working

856
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,119
on right now we are trying to increase

857
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,960
the automation level of our checks

858
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,640
whereas scaling

859
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,359
our methods

860
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,560
we are also doing analysis of uh

861
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,520
comprehensive solutions

862
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,720
and we are also doing an assessment of

863
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,640
the performance of the system is part of

864
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,200
expert services and we're expanding the

865
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,160
support

866
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,680
providers thank you very much let me

867
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,560
take your questions now

868
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,720
what's the minimal size or what's the

869
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,200
minimum number of sources and what kind

870
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,040
of minimum requirements do they need to

871
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,000
meet

872
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,760
in order for this system to make sense

873
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:29,809
[Music]

874
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,959
what do you mean make sense

875
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,440
well in order for event correlations to

876
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,720
work

877
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,319
in order for me to be able to prove its

878
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:45,440
value to business what do i need

879
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,319
well win event lock syslog kaspersky

880
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,160
would be most popular sources we

881
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,079
actually have a reference guide which

882
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,240
lists all the data sources that we

883
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,599
support

884
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,920
you know what our customers do

885
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,160
they check this reference document

886
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,000
compare it to what they have

887
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,920
and they start connecting them one by

888
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,800
one

889
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,720
in the order of decreasing importance

890
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,640
but it all really starts with the you

891
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,480
know your interest as a client what is

892
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,480
situated to monitor and defend

893
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,280
let me build on this answer

894
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,960
well we need to have a proper

895
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,000
understanding of the whole

896
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,400
infrastructure in the system which means

897
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,480
that all these sources should be

898
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,720
available as assets

899
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,280
and just like alexander said

900
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,839
depending on the criticality of the

901
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:34,960
system

902
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,040
basically domain controllers or business

903
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,560
systems or dbms so what have you

904
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,440
so depending on their criticality

905
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,119
you will

906
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,160
want to monitor them and collect events

907
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,520
and analyze them

908
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,359
that is we connect everything we've got

909
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,839
the more the better and then we check if

910
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:56,400
it is statistically significant and

911
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,480
valid yes that's one of the ways of

912
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,079
putting it

913
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,560
who's next

914
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,880
thank you for the report

915
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,280
you have mentioned several areas i think

916
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,839
nine that you inspect including

917
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:16,240
architecture

918
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,359
so in hierarchical installations

919
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:22,319
will the health check work on all

920
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,240
subordinate installations so just a

921
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,720
parental one

922
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,000
i think we're checking all the servers

923
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,760
but i will be corrected if i get it

924
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,920
wrong

925
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,119
so the whole installation even if it is

926
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:40,119
hierarchical

927
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,800
you know it does make sense to start

928
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,839
with a parental site

929
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,880
or a particular branch

930
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,240
and there you will see you will decide

931
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,640
which pain points you have and whether

932
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,160
it makes sense for you and if it does

933
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,640
you will continue and

934
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,950
increase the scope

935
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:03,100
[Music]

936
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,359
you've mentioned that you will be

937
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:08,640
checking rabbit m key

938
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,599
is this an active check

939
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:13,920
and will then health check go to rabbit

940
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,079
mq with some credentials or will it be

941
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,240
simply reading the log let me explain

942
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,400
where i'm coming from with this question

943
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,520
if we

944
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:25,520
say change the standards uh passwords on

945
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,160
rabbit mq will it uh be unavailable to

946
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,640
health check

947
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:36,079
we do not check the rabbit

948
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,560
cm has got a special service for doing

949
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,720
that

950
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,960
and we will be looking at the alerts

951
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,240
from individual keys

952
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,240
if you want to check it we'll ask you

953
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,920
for a password and we'll go deep into it

954
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,760
but in fact we're more interested in the

955
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,440
config file

956
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,280
you know see what kind of limits you

957
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,680
have there for keys how memory is

958
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,920
configured and that should be enough

959
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,079
thank you

960
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,119
good afternoon good evening good night

961
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,640
for god's sake

962
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,400
thank you very much

963
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,280
you know i'm working so much with scenes

964
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,880
i have several questions i may have

965
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,720
missed it in your report is that a

966
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,240
standalone product or will it be part of

967
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,560
uh off the box off the shelf solutions

968
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,800
like i said all these tools are

969
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,200
available in the off-the-shelf solution

970
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,680
let me put it differently all these

971
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,079
functions are available separately and

972
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,920
we've been talking about you know this

973
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,839
health monitoring thing

974
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:48,079
as uh you know an extra service from the

975
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,240
technical support team so just talk to

976
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,000
your manager we'll be happy to tell you

977
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,160
more

978
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,880
all these things

979
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,960
you know they represent our internal

980
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,560
expertise you know having these tools

981
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,599
is one thing interpreting it properly is

982
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,200
different

983
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,119
you know and going to a higher level of

984
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:13,560
obstruction as the need might be

985
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,920
to do inspection of correlation rules if

986
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,960
they were developed by the users

987
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,599
and they may be for example in conflict

988
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,520
with the current configurations for

989
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,800
individual data sources

990
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,040
so i'm particularly interested in user

991
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,960
generated rules

992
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,440
alexander

993
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,240
correlations and normalizations

994
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,240
if you have some specific concerns

995
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,720
if you are not sure for example if you

996
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,400
got this role right

997
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,640
we can talk about it

998
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,359
it's not that we will be analyzing all

999
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,119
your rules

1000
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:09,520
you know what many clients will not want

1001
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,280
to share their expertise like this and

1002
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,800
that would make a loss amount of work

1003
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,520
for us as well

1004
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,599
when will it be done i mean when

1005
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,240
conflicts arise yes

1006
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,640
and what if this conflicts are sort of

1007
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,920
latent

1008
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,319
you know during installation

1009
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:32,000
they were not easy to see

1010
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,559
maybe later

1011
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,280
while there is an inbuilt mechanism for

1012
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,839
a conflict

1013
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,240
that should show things like this

1014
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:47,839
obviously

1015
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:50,480
as far as the system is concerned

1016
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,720
you should not be able to

1017
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,839
create in parallel to conflicting rules

1018
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:59,359
but it can happen in real life i mean

1019
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:02,400
in corner cases

1020
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,280
in other words

1021
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,400
it's a way of packaging the existing

1022
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,800
functions

1023
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,599
and it's like a checklist on the main

1024
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:21,200
page version 10 right or is does it have

1025
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,119
like expanded functionality does it make

1026
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:24,480
sense in other words for me to talk to

1027
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,040
my managers

1028
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,400
so you've effectively asked me about

1029
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,960
this system

1030
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,040
yes is that a different way of packaging

1031
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,119
the functions that you know have been

1032
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:42,160
around for some time

1033
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:45,760
let me give you this answer

1034
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,760
you know as part of extended support we

1035
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,520
have been offering some like health

1036
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,280
check where we would you know check the

1037
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,200
architecture and check the performance

1038
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,720
of the system

1039
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,440
and we try to make sure that everything

1040
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,920
is fine at least from the viewpoint of

1041
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,839
the way the system is running

1042
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:11,119
now we realize this is not enough

1043
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,920
we realize that expertise also needs to

1044
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,000
be inspected

1045
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,599
and this requires more

1046
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:22,000
profound dialects so to speak it

1047
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,480
requires many more interviews

1048
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,880
it may well show for example that the

1049
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,960
client has only connected

1050
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,280
half of sources available

1051
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,680
and if expertise is lacking let's talk

1052
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,800
more or maybe the administrator doesn't

1053
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,640
have the time maybe he's like the only

1054
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,279
person there

1055
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,880
we should be able to help the

1056
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,880
administrator

1057
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,760
so our objective here is to identify

1058
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,119
hopefully more issues for you and

1059
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,839
propose solutions

1060
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,160
so the administrator using this product

1061
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,480
will collect information that will go to

1062
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,480
you for additional analysis and you will

1063
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,559
provide additional recommendations or is

1064
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:03,359
more

1065
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:05,759
private

1066
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,359
so you will be sort of seeing all this

1067
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:12,759
stuff right

1068
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,000
you know what it should be initiated by

1069
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
the client the client

1070
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,760
needs to want to do that needs to

1071
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,720
want to learn if he is using this

1072
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,400
product the right way but he's doing

1073
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,880
this analysis we are doing this analysis

1074
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,200
and we will be involving your

1075
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,599
administrator for that

1076
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:39,200
you know all the technical checks we

1077
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,599
will do on our own but the rest

1078
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:45,200
for that we will need your your admin

1079
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,160
and this 120 checks that we mentioned

1080
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,960
earlier today

1081
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,160
well at least we told you about the

1082
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,520
structure so we run this 120 checks

1083
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,440
and that we process all the information

1084
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,319
received this way

1085
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:03,520
and this is where you know besides our

1086
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,559
tackies we also engage our experts

1087
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:08,480
so for example around bugs we will

1088
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,280
involve our developers

1089
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,200
we will be asking them what could be

1090
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,440
potentially wrong with this data

1091
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,520
processing

1092
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,520
and we'll also be talking to developers

1093
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,000
about say additional features so it's a

1094
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
pretty good way of you know doing a

1095
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,040
summary

1096
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,839
of the current state so to speak of our

1097
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,440
system

1098
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:33,040
on your uh or like your instance of our

1099
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,359
system

1100
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,920
i guess that's the gist of it

1101
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,240
yes i was about to

1102
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,480
say pretty much the same thing that we

1103
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,280
bring a whole team to you

1104
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,720
so it's not that you know we bring you a

1105
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,759
disc and we tell you

1106
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:59,670
[Music]

1107
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,190
it's a terminology question i guess

1108
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:08,360
[Music]

1109
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,079
i understand that mac special has vm not

1110
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:14,960
just cm right

1111
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,880
so this health check you've been talking

1112
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,079
about is it only available to cm

1113
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:22,559
customers

1114
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,598
alexander touched upon it briefly

1115
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,720
we are planning to expand it

1116
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,959
which

1117
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,280
and actually we want to cover all the

1118
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,760
all the bundles

1119
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,920
and we're not going to

1120
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,119
you know do it separately for cm and vm

1121
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:59,359
we want to cover the whole

1122
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:01,119
gamut

1123
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:03,920
thank you for your report

1124
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,920
i want to go back to the slide here

1125
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,079
where you parse

1126
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:10,160
the log of health monitor if i remember

1127
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,839
it correctly

1128
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:15,119
what kind of tools do you use

1129
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:18,319
for lock paracen

1130
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,119
which one

1131
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:25,760
the previous one

1132
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,119
so how did you get that table

1133
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:30,240
from that block

1134
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,359
well this is powershell

1135
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:36,720
no i'm talking about the previous slides

1136
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,240
this is the log

1137
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:43,118
okay and what tools do you use to parse

1138
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:45,119
it's all done with a single powershell

1139
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:47,040
script

1140
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:51,520
we take health monitoring log and log 1.

1141
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,400
in order to

1142
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,359
you know cover 30 days or 90 days

1143
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,319
whatever the scope is

1144
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:04,000
and then we parse it with powershell

1145
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,920
so you're effectively parsing by warning

1146
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,119
and error keywords

1147
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:13,040
no actually there is this regular

1148
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:17,280
expression issue dots asterisk

1149
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,960
and this one for example oh i should

1150
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,359
have actually covered it

1151
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,520
yes

1152
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:26,240
what are the goodies to be found here we

1153
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,800
have error type

1154
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,599
error id

1155
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,480
name of component

1156
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:39,839
c off type here flow cue space error

1157
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,160
all the stuff you can see here

1158
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:48,720
i'm sorry you can not probably read it

1159
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,240
or maybe

1160
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:57,950
[Music]

1161
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,200
what if there is a typo in a particular

1162
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,240
word in a log

1163
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,960
then you will obviously miss it right

1164
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,440
now this stuff

1165
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,599
makes me think of normalizers

1166
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:26,319
you know with normalization rules and

1167
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:28,558
stuff

1168
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:31,680
have you thought about that

1169
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,440
let me answer the part of your question

1170
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,280
about logs

1171
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,680
logs are produced by codes

1172
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,319
so i'm not really sure what kind of typo

1173
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:41,920
can happen there

1174
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,480
a software developer responsible for the

1175
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,240
logging process

1176
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,240
what if he makes a typo in a word you

1177
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,480
know he then notices it

1178
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,880
he corrects it and then search by

1179
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,720
regular expressions will no longer see

1180
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,240
it

1181
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,319
now we are talking here about a limited

1182
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:00,559
number of error types and they roll

1183
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:03,280
covers with our chats

1184
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:08,799
the total is like 50 types of errors

1185
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:11,040
for example

1186
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:15,200
excess of rabbit mq

1187
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,520
or waiting time reached a threshold or

1188
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,760
an agent going offline or a service

1189
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,839
going offline

1190
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:26,720
space error

1191
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,000
it can be you know the size of q in

1192
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,559
gigabytes or could be size of q in

1193
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,000
events

1194
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,160
waiting time for a particular component

1195
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,559
has exceeded the threshold

1196
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:42,640
so we are talking here about specific

1197
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,640
tracks which are hard coded and they do

1198
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,720
not contain errors otherwise would have

1199
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:47,920
known about them and would have

1200
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,400
addressed them

1201
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,280
so i guess this comparison is not really

1202
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:58,280
valid your comparison to normalizer

1203
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,720
um

1204
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,640
how many people

1205
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,839
do we need

1206
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:30,799
to migrate from a different cm system

1207
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:34,799
to your cm system and will we be able to

1208
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:36,960
migrate the rules that were developed

1209
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,839
for this other cm system and

1210
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,400
how much time do

1211
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,880
your people need to spend on the system

1212
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,960
if we cannot give you say remote access

1213
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:54,720
so you mean you have your cmcs cm in

1214
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,640
place yes

1215
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,720
and if we need to migrate to your system

1216
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,118
for example

1217
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:06,640
the best thing you can do is talk to our

1218
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,640
managers i'm sorry about that

1219
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:12,319
it's a technical question isn't it

1220
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,680
like do you provide

1221
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:19,129
[Music]

1222
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,359
like training know how much time will

1223
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:25,040
this require

1224
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,960
well you're asking me how many people

1225
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,880
will be required for migration that will

1226
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,160
really depend on the size and the time

1227
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,880
you would want to do it in right maybe

1228
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,400
you can do it you know with the help of

1229
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,960
a single person

1230
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,960
that should be a superman

1231
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,040
i'm sorry but we will need for this

1232
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,880
discussion we'll need the specific

1233
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,520
figures and my problem is that you know

1234
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,200
i won't even be able to give you an

1235
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,680
answer even if i see your numbers

1236
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,520
please talk to our managers they will be

1237
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:57,440
happy to help you okay thank you

1238
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,160
i have a question

1239
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:04,839
may i finally ask it i'm not sure

1240
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,440
or a service

1241
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:30,960
and there are in fact several

1242
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,520
distribution channels shall i say you

1243
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,559
can indeed get it as extended tech

1244
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:38,960
support

1245
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,400
and our colleagues are looking right now

1246
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,559
it's uh how to promote it otherwise

1247
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:46,880
because

1248
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,119
i think it's best that you talk to the

1249
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,200
managers really we wanted to cover the

1250
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,280
technical elements and my question will

1251
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,040
be technical

1252
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,280
it's just a principal question i think

1253
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,160
yes

1254
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,118
look here just

1255
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:13,119
[Music]

1256
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:16,559
and it will be working in parallel to cm

1257
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,480
and will be giving us you know traffic

1258
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,280
light indication

1259
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:24,480
not really

1260
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,559
you know the way it works is that our

1261
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:29,200
people will arrive they will check your

1262
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,599
system together with your people

1263
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:33,359
you know we will launch automation

1264
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:35,520
scripts we will also do many other

1265
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,040
checks we will be asking you for

1266
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,359
additional information and architecture

1267
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:40,880
data sources

1268
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,119
and

1269
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,480
i think that doing it only once makes

1270
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,799
little sense because i'm not sure we'll

1271
01:00:56,799 --> 01:00:59,520
be able to fix all your issues

1272
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,240
that fast

1273
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:05,920
so i would propose that you know on the

1274
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,400
basis of the issues with architecture

1275
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,240
and whatever

1276
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,799
you develop a road map you know you

1277
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:17,599
address it with some projects over time

1278
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,599
and if you like the results what do we

1279
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:21,359
do and we hope you will

1280
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:22,880
see which is good

1281
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,839
you will sometimes later say in the year

1282
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:27,920
invite us again

1283
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,480
you know to assess the delta to assess

1284
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,119
the improvements

1285
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,720
where you may choose to

1286
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:39,680
run a similar test a similar audit

1287
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,079
yourselves because all the tools are

1288
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:43,599
available it's just you know

1289
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,359
orchestrating them which may be

1290
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:46,480
difficult

1291
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,559
yeah right and i would guess it should

1292
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:53,720
be done uh much earlier than in a year

1293
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,440
would you like to give us additional

1294
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,470
details on that

1295
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:07,280
[Music]

1296
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,920
and besides this parameter such as index

1297
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,599
size

1298
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:14,000
what else is being checked with respect

1299
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
to elasticsearch and what are your other

1300
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,960
recommendations there

1301
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,240
depends on the size of your

1302
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:33,359
infrastructure and type of installation

1303
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:36,319
if we stick to the guys

1304
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:38,880
we currently have like four types of

1305
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,039
infrastructure

1306
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:45,039
regular loads uh high uh loads uh

1307
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:48,640
super high loads extra higher loads so

1308
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,960
there will be policies there like uh hot

1309
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:54,319
data worm data coal data

1310
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:55,119
and

1311
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:56,880
migration policies

1312
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,400
yeah migration policies

1313
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:02,960
if you have a super high low system we

1314
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,839
will be checking your policies for sure

1315
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:07,920
and i cannot give you any guidance here

1316
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,200
in terms of number of indexes and index

1317
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,599
sizes because

1318
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:15,200
data distribution principles there will

1319
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,359
be different also there is a significant

1320
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:19,359
change between releases you know release

1321
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:22,000
25 is uh planned for

1322
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,680
you know a relatively

1323
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:26,319
relative uh soon diet

1324
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:28,400
and they're also like elastic surge

1325
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,400
differences

1326
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,480
so we will care about volumes for sure

1327
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,799
and the ability of your system to manage

1328
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:41,920
this flow

1329
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,039
do you have

1330
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:46,799
capacity extra capacity or not

1331
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:49,839
naxa will be checking if elasticsearch

1332
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:52,079
is stable does it go into the red zone

1333
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:54,880
or it doesn't and if it does why

1334
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,359
previously for example

1335
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:59,920
there was this issue with out of memory

1336
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,359
errors

1337
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:05,079
like in 1.7 it was quite prevalent in uh

1338
01:04:05,079 --> 01:04:09,839
7.4 it was intermittent in 7.9 it rarely

1339
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:10,839
ever

1340
01:04:10,839 --> 01:04:13,680
surfaces it does but it's indeed a very

1341
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:15,839
rare occasion

1342
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:18,559
so stability is an important concern to

1343
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:21,440
us thank you i've got more

1344
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,599
what

1345
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:33,839
or monitoring of cluster installations

1346
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:37,760
such as elastic surge and postgresql

1347
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:40,760
non-hierarchically

1348
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:47,119
i'm talking about cluster stability

1349
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:49,119
well if you have

1350
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:51,920
fold resistant installations they need

1351
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:54,720
to be inspected for sure

1352
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,920
so this automated utility

1353
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,119
will it do that

1354
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:02,480
will it cause a verdict

1355
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,240
automated checks

1356
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,400
are all very well and we automate as

1357
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,799
much as we can but the scenario you have

1358
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:11,039
described this is something that will be

1359
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:12,799
checked manually

1360
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:16,319
failing to check a database and it's uh

1361
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:18,880
stability and reliability

1362
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:22,960
will undermine the quality of our audit

1363
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,359
need to talk to that person

1364
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:40,030
so it will be a manual exercise

1365
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:43,249
[Music]

1366
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,880
are there any metrics

1367
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,880
or indicators you would recommend

1368
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:57,760
to control for online

1369
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,640
you know having an extended

1370
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:00,940
buzz

1371
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:02,079
[Music]

1372
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:04,000
traffic light system particularly for

1373
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,090
databases

1374
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:07,119
[Music]

1375
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:11,839
maybe some templates for zymex

1376
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:16,000
set of metrics

1377
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:18,960
check

1378
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:21,920
you know everything we want to have in

1379
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,760
the traffic lights we will put in the

1380
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,680
traffic lights such as database

1381
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,200
monitoring

1382
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:30,119
like i said if the database exceeds

1383
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:32,559
150 gigabytes you need to consider

1384
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:33,760
vacuum

1385
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:34,559
and

1386
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:36,799
reasons for its um you know

1387
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:39,920
overblown sizes

1388
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,440
so you may want to build alerts and

1389
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,240
whatever it's not available off the box

1390
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,920
off the shelf right now but we have

1391
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,119
added some

1392
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:51,200
simple scripts that do these kind of

1393
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,520
checks and it will tell you the size of

1394
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,680
each database

1395
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:58,640
hundreds of thank you

1396
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,640
please talk to your managers they will

1397
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,319
be happy to give you additional

1398
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:16,240
information and we'll be happy to get in

1399
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,240
