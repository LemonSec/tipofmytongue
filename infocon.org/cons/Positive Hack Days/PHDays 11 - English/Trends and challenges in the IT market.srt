1
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,279
on the cyber security market we see

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,080
tectonic changes

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,160
and there's a lot of reasons behind it

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,240
and in recent several months those

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,040
changes that we are able to see globally

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,279
in the world they're just reinforcing

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,359
the changes in the cyber security area

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,640
and right now we're going to speak about

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,960
what really happens in this market we're

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,320
going to speak about trends and

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,160
challenges on the it and cyber security

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,840
market together with igor svetanev

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,359
michael commercial director of our

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,479
vision and

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,480
ign uh

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,600
pango raider development director hello

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,920
hello

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,879
i.t and information security in the

19
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,160
conditions of sanctions

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,320
what do you see

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,480
what really happens in the market

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,879
okay let's begin with you

23
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,719
know

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,520
recent several months

25
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,120
we see active changes

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,199
and foreign players living

27
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,560
in a country and they leave

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,479
opportunities of using their products

29
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,080
and services on the side of the client

30
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,119
this is the main pain that we hear from

31
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,080
our clients and this is the main thing

32
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,399
um

33
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,640
which is flying in here

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,520
and those technologies which are used by

35
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,079
the clients are becoming unuseful and

36
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,840
this is to my point of view the main

37
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,520
reason and a consequence of these

38
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,360
sanctions

39
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,680
uh because of this

40
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,479
the first thing that

41
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,040
an energy client has on his side they

42
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,840
start looking at how can this be

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,960
replaced which domestic products and

44
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,399
solutions

45
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,880
can be used speaking about a hardware

46
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,520
component software component what can be

47
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,798
used to replace them

48
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,520
speaking about the direction of their

49
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,880
movement speaking about clients

50
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,758
right now we see the first focus of

51
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,599
those clients and critical elements of

52
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,840
the infrastructure and critical i.t

53
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,000
services uh information security

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,879
services which

55
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,640
have to be viable and which have to be

56
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,720
protected and they should protect

57
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,000
company and should provide cyber

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,520
security on the side of the company so

59
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,920
we are focusing in this direction

60
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,760
and i think this is a very good trend on

61
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,680
the side of the clients not distribution

62
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,959
but you know focusing on the most

63
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,959
important things

64
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,319
as for

65
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,560
informational security depends on i.t

66
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,120
technology and i t technology also

67
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,120
technology goes through a number of

68
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,680
technological changes some of them

69
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,760
become unavailable

70
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,200
or difficult to use

71
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,280
have a number of similar problems and

72
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,080
questions which make them search for

73
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,400
alternatives and it is very important to

74
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,239
specify

75
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,560
that we can divide all the technology

76
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,720
services and products in i.t and

77
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,879
information security into three main

78
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,440
categories category number one we have

79
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,319
sufficient number of analogies and you

80
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,080
can go to the market and you can

81
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,959
immediately see uh taking the domestic

82
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,200
technology the one which can be used the

83
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,319
second one there is one maximum two

84
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,280
products in these type of technologies

85
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,519
and from this point of view

86
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,400
like

87
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,400
in the lack of products

88
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,879
you can use whatever is available or you

89
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,280
should wait or maybe you should invent

90
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,000
alternative solutions and number three

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,760
those technologies products and services

92
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,840
which are not available in the market

93
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,680
and

94
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,080
there are three types of products so

95
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,680
clients are

96
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,480
making their own priorities first two

97
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,879
priorities are the operators where you

98
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,450
can find the solution and close your gap

99
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,120
[Music]

100
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,159
and category number three is the most

101
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,280
vulnerable one

102
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,360
and from this point of view we see that

103
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,480
there is a certain market trend yeah

104
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,120
the pavlina is a product of which to add

105
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,600
new products and technologies and we

106
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,759
hear from number of clients that well

107
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,759
turkish manufacturer or some other

108
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,759
alternative manufacturer makes those

109
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,919
products who is ready to offer maybe not

110
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,160
ideal maybe below average solution

111
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,880
however it's going to close and cover

112
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,960
the existing gap

113
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,880
misha how do you see those changes in

114
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,120
the market

115
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,199
i'm looking a totally different segment

116
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,040
than my colleagues these are cm

117
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,400
solutions and speaking about cm

118
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,639
solutions

119
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,280
an obvious trend of import substitution

120
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,280
and it did not impact us very

121
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,120
significantly because the industry and

122
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,080
cm systems in particular they are moving

123
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,000
on those rails and they work very

124
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,680
successfully in this direction in the

125
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,280
course of the recent year all the

126
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,199
projects approximately eighty percent of

127
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,840
the projects that we've been dealing and

128
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,919
competing with this were domestic

129
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,560
solutions so we see less and less of

130
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,720
western players and right now we see

131
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,039
even less of those yes of course in

132
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,639
recent three months the number of

133
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,440
requests for pilots for substitution of

134
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,680
western vendors have increased by the

135
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,680
fourfold

136
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,000
that's the official statistics and cm

137
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,479
systems

138
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,240
irrespectively to the situation that

139
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,000
most of them were domestic and we have

140
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,080
not we don't have to replace any one of

141
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,960
them but if you look superficial at this

142
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,600
cm systems are the tools which don't

143
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
work by themselves and they depend on

144
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,919
data and data sources

145
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,880
events uh sources of ti feeds or the geo

146
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,240
ip databases

147
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,280
and there's a lot of options like that

148
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,479
and

149
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,120
this system works and it gives very good

150
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,680
results without them it's

151
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,080
impossible so input substitution of

152
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,280
these dependencies

153
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,680
is the main direction of our operations

154
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,600
all the em systems they stopped working

155
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,039
because the clients and our claw uh

156
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,039
they don't have the products uh the

157
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,759
sources of events which were being

158
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,360
resources events and this is the key

159
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,360
problem right now because replacing

160
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,600
these products

161
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,680
well it's very problematic to replace

162
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,000
them by current solutions because as we

163
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
can see it right now on the market there

164
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,080
are certain domestic analogies of these

165
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,479
systems but very often

166
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,319
they don't have any logging all this

167
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,639
logging does not allow them to detect

168
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,280
attacks or prevent those attacks

169
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,039
that's why this is a big problem and

170
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,800
this is what we're speaking about in the

171
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,720
course of the next two days on our stand

172
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,000
not speaking about numbers and

173
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,360
statistics

174
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,800
and statistical trends

175
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,560
according to your assessment looking at

176
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,440
the recent events do you expect growth

177
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,240
drop or maybe a steady development on

178
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,960
the same level and except same condition

179
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,880
of the i.t market and information

180
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,360
security market

181
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,360
we're speaking about market in general

182
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,599
or a certain segment yeah we can divide

183
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,360
it we can divide it because it's

184
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,000
interesting how do you look at the it

185
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,319
market cyber security market and its

186
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,960
separate segments

187
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,639
well in our portfolio we have five

188
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,520
different products each and in every

189
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,440
niche we can speak about them separately

190
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,280
but if you look at it generally our

191
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,199
vision of the information security

192
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,759
market generally is going to drop the

193
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,199
market is gonna shrink because most of

194
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,840
the products were solutions

195
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,879
from like firewalls and number of other

196
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,440
similar and technological products which

197
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,080
became unavailable

198
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,319
so replenishing this volume of the

199
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,280
market which was present uh presented by

200
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,879
foreign products don't we have our own

201
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,960
firewalls of course we do of course we

202
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,120
do have them but it's gonna not gonna be

203
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,680
possible to satisfy all the clients who

204
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,759
previously used

205
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,759
well if it's if it's going to be a queue

206
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,199
and you can sell the same products all

207
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,199
of them but still still

208
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,720
different products they have different

209
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,400
technologies and it's impossible to

210
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,919
realize the

211
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,160
whole functionality in one product well

212
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,000
one client have used from one vendor now

213
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,280
you have used from another vendor and

214
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,120
they've been choosing this vendors

215
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,560
because of certain functional

216
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,479
peculiarities in the facilities

217
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,080
so there's a certain functional

218
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,839
particularities it's impossible to bring

219
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,000
it in one or even two three products in

220
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,200
a short period of time that's why

221
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,040
even with consideration what is

222
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,480
available from the product and

223
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,760
technological point of view it's

224
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,440
impossible to sell it to all the

225
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,800
products i'm not speaking about our

226
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,959
products yes we are going to be able to

227
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,279
do that and everything's going to be all

228
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,640
right with our projects but generally

229
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,080
speaking speaking about the market

230
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,200
players i think that

231
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,360
information security market players they

232
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,080
are going to see certain growth because

233
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,160
we see product substitution and

234
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,600
replacement and demand is going to grow

235
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,760
but how much it's going to grow single

236
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,080
percentages dozens of percentages or

237
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,480
it's going to be radical growth dozens

238
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,560
of percentages

239
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,760
[Music]

240
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,680
well it's a simple technology the client

241
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,880
had a budget

242
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,600
and in this budget they had a cluster of

243
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,800
products

244
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,360
which they had to spend for foreign

245
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,040
analogies they did not spend it they

246
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,200
redistribute the budget and they buy

247
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,959
something they had to buy in a year or

248
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,279
two and they put it in a higher priority

249
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,320
especially speaking about our

250
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,240
technologies as some of our products for

251
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,920
example deception systems

252
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,880
they are not initial products for them

253
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,720
in the class of this product so we have

254
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,200
planned in a year or two to buy them and

255
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,959
client

256
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,279
puts it on a higher priority and they

257
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,160
come to us they ask us and this is how

258
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,720
our market is growing the client does

259
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,200
not spend the whole budget on this and

260
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,120
generally speaking well everybody gets

261
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,920
their own advantage

262
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,399
misha you wanted to add something yes i

263
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,959
wanted to remind all our dear clients

264
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,800
that first of all they are buying

265
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,399
products not for the functionality but

266
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,480
for solving their own problems and we

267
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,720
have to remember about it right now

268
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,079
because no matter what you think there

269
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,040
are russian analogies and you have to

270
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,399
forget about the absence of certain

271
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,000
functionality but this will allow you to

272
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,560
solve this problem here and now

273
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,240
the problem of non allowing these uh

274
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,240
unallowable and impossible events

275
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,160
and i would like to continue this topic

276
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,480
by saying

277
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,600
in the beginning there was a hype of

278
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,440
demand

279
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,959
when everything happened in february

280
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,399
march

281
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,959
and this can be described by a phrase as

282
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:57,920
the

283
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,160
tough import substitution and i'm

284
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,279
speaking only about our small cm

285
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,200
solution segment

286
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,360
and of course

287
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,600
everybody who's been following western

288
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,760
cm systems and they didn't want to do

289
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,760
that because they've been satisfied with

290
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,519
all of these and these

291
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,000
are reminders this remaining 20

292
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,920
who stayed in western cm systems

293
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,519
they started speaking with the market

294
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,200
they started getting interested

295
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,000
in how can they replace all of these but

296
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,560
then they got peaceful and many decided

297
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,200
to stay with what whatever they've used

298
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,279
and decided to move this question a year

299
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,560
ahead or two years ahead but

300
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,680
nevertheless

301
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,200
this market

302
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,959
especially for speaking about cm systems

303
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,360
market is going to grow and i think it's

304
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,519
going to grow by dozens or a couple of

305
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,240
dozens of percentages but right now it's

306
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,040
too early to speak about it

307
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,680
which market segments do you expect will

308
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,000
grow the fastest

309
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,120
i'm speaking about cyber security market

310
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,880
the fastest growing segment will be

311
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,279
in point

312
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,680
point i think it's gonna be a networking

313
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,399
part of the security systems and

314
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,800
we'll see more and more manufacturers so

315
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,560
firewalls

316
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,240
there should be some substitutions yeah

317
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,200
firewalls okay

318
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,839
cm i don't think cm market is very

319
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,680
definite and everything's very well

320
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,279
understandable players are very well

321
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,720
understandable i'm not going to argue

322
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,880
with it yes i also wanted to say that

323
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,440
networking security related with

324
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,440
firewalls and other

325
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,519
ips ids topics will be on the horse

326
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,920
because

327
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,920
it was the biggest market by volume

328
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,880
and very strong and big players left

329
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,000
this market and they have to be

330
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,760
substituted so firewalls cm's endpoints

331
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,519
endpoint below

332
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,399
not so strong

333
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,480
because we had foreign players been

334
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,639
present on the market there will be

335
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,880
certain growth and substitution what

336
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,639
else i think there's going to be the

337
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,480
growth of specialized solutions which

338
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,560
were weakly represented in the russian

339
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,199
market for example load balancers

340
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,519
container protection systems some

341
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,920
specialized solutions which

342
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,079
were not presented by russian products

343
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,600
well they are

344
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,279
producing something like that but they

345
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,720
are not available so this part of the

346
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,040
market this is something new that is

347
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,800
being born in the market and created the

348
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,160
market and we'll see a lot of new

349
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,760
products so everything related with

350
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,600
network security and other new

351
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,279
directions and web application

352
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,519
protection ddos attack protection i

353
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,600
think this will be key and the hottest

354
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,360
topic

355
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,839
what do you think the decree of the

356
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,120
president

357
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,920
uh

358
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,800
from the may 1st which makes the comedy

359
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,399
to have responsible people inside of the

360
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,199
companies for the cyber security

361
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,440
another decree related to that before

362
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,720
2025 everybody should switch to russian

363
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,480
software products in the area of

364
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,220
informational security

365
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,299
[Music]

366
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,639
will this influence

367
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,839
the changes of the market of everything

368
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,120
would happen by itself

369
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,560
uh two and a half years in the course of

370
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,160
two and a half years we one can produce

371
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,360
the first working version industrial

372
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,680
working version of the product so those

373
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,240
technologies which are missing

374
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,480
and products foreign products which are

375
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,160
being used

376
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,000
and where there's no russian analogies

377
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
for this period of time of course we

378
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,160
should have russian analogies and this

379
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,760
will be the first versions first

380
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,519
industrial versions two and a half years

381
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,199
it's the period when the first

382
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,160
industrial version will be produced

383
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,760
so for these products it's going to be

384
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,440
reinforcement because it's a small

385
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,279
market i'm speaking about specialized

386
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,839
products

387
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,360
if not for this degree the meaning of

388
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,240
creating this small market well maybe

389
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,160
it's better for you to

390
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,360
fight for the cm market or maybe for the

391
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,440
endpoint market that's why in the

392
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,519
framework of these

393
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,440
specialized segments

394
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,440
uh it's going to be a driver or

395
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,600
catalyzer as for other products

396
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,079
internally speaking

397
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,120
we do see growth we see competition and

398
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,279
this competition makes uh improvement of

399
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,800
the products

400
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,759
that's why in half of these segments

401
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,600
even more than half of these segments of

402
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,199
products

403
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,399
analogy

404
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,680
we see

405
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,079
analogies and they will become a better

406
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,160
quality and this is the second driver

407
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,279
which makes me think

408
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,720
i think this is

409
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,600
another impact for security for the sake

410
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,519
of security and then we'll come to the

411
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,199
situation that security should be

412
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,360
understandable cognitive uh

413
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,720
understandable by the heads of the

414
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,160
companies and finally it's gonna be good

415
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,279
for the market it's gonna be good for

416
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,639
the business and for the country in

417
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,639
general so basically speaking it's going

418
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,440
to be

419
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,279
from one side it's going to be positive

420
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,880
and on the other side possibly it's

421
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,920
going to be

422
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,320
well there will be certain difficulties

423
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,800
we have seen some of those and just for

424
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,120
the sake of it i would like to add

425
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,160
that right now

426
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,079
we have to search

427
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,440
for responsible people because we miss

428
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,800
people on the market we don't have

429
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,639
enough people

430
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,720
we have the

431
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,240
hunger for

432
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,399
people on this market for specialists

433
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,920
and we have to start thinking

434
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,639
differently previously you were taking

435
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,160
foreign and russian and you've been

436
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,320
building security you've been solving

437
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,560
problems and cases right now you have to

438
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,839
be creative how can you connect things

439
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,759
which are inconnectable especially from

440
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,240
the product point of view and from this

441
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,160
position from this point of view you

442
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,279
will divide this well i think this is a

443
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,439
negative side of this coin so you have

444
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,679
to move fast and sometimes it's very

445
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,280
difficult to do it on a good quality

446
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,959
level well today during the different

447
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,079
interview we've been speaking about

448
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,679
global leaders in the area of

449
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,359
development of information security

450
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,559
products

451
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,599
and we've been speaking about three

452
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,280
areas

453
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,000
three countries united states israel and

454
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,599
russia

455
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,839
do you agree with this statement this is

456
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,280
the first part of my question and the

457
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,120
second part of my question whether

458
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,760
russia will be able to provide itself

459
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,919
fully with information security products

460
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,799
we are speaking about the same countries

461
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,559
about our clients because uh speaking

462
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,360
about threat intelligence platforms uh

463
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,840
this platform was produced in russia and

464
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,440
when speaking about analogies they are

465
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,799
available in the united states and

466
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,280
israel looking at other products

467
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,440
these are the main players and suppliers

468
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,600
of cyber security products there are

469
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,440
some separate

470
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,160
players in europe

471
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,240
that have been mentioning like turkey

472
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,039
and number of other countries

473
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,400
but

474
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,919
much lesser the main big three players

475
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,919
um

476
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,480
well russia will be able to realize

477
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,200
these lack of technological products in

478
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,600
cyber security area which currently is

479
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,000
available

480
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,000
well i'm really interested in this

481
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,520
cross-section well let's begin with

482
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,440
something earlier russia

483
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,720
israel

484
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,120
and russian programmers in the last

485
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,600
billion years they are winning all the

486
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,760
programming olympics in the world

487
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,880
all the programming olympics globally

488
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,520
well all the news that i read

489
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,480
on this matter a lot of olympic olympics

490
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,039
are won by our programmers

491
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,320
so all the programmers

492
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,120
all the resumes that i read

493
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,679
i see the lines when they

494
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,400
come made some github projects or some

495
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,120
other projects so they invest in open

496
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,120
source which unfortunately this open

497
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,120
source

498
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,440
cannot be used in russia due to

499
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,919
known reasons

500
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:18,880
yes

501
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,559
and i'm

502
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,639
looking at all of these and internally

503
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,120
i'm not speaking about the open source

504
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,840
context but we should invest

505
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,600
in the development of local amazon

506
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,520
solutions and community around these

507
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,000
solutions

508
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,600
we should look up publications of some

509
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,039
source code

510
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,280
some know how we should give them to the

511
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,679
world so that they can be used and push

512
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,720
the industry for the further development

513
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,160
so maybe this is the secret of our

514
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,679
development because in russia cyber

515
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,000
security would become the first one and

516
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,720
from the point of view of programmers

517
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,039
we are ahead of everybody how can we use

518
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,480
this potential that's a totally

519
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,240
different question another thing that

520
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,400
really worries me

521
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,919
we can provide ourselves with cyber

522
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,000
security products uh and this is

523
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,720
competition because the market compared

524
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,559
to the global market is not as big by

525
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,840
the quality of the

526
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,919
products can be improved only in tough

527
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,960
competition conditions

528
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,580
so we need a strong internal competition

529
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,720
[Music]

530
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,559
the products from friendly countries

531
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,580
china india maybe israel

532
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,840
[Music]

533
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,080
with whom we can compare ourselves and

534
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,720
make global level solutions things that

535
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,039
i see in the recent year

536
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,720
in the same cm segment recently cms are

537
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,840
created like you know cookies

538
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,760
internal competition is very colossal

539
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,600
and these uh projects and products are

540
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,960
being created within the year and they

541
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,080
become very competitive and uh

542
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,720
i think they don't need any external

543
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,080
intervention

544
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,799
and there could be a small provocation

545
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,720
for our current clients or potential

546
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,200
clients that

547
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,320
maybe we need to stop worrying uh

548
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,400
about investing into russian technology

549
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,880
maybe they are uh what maybe they are

550
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,280
more mature less mature but we all have

551
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,159
to invest our money time

552
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,240
into making

553
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,559
these and earlier later we'll have to do

554
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,120
that it's better earlier than later

555
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,039
and of course we are looking at the

556
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,320
client

557
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,880
and the client

558
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,840
has very complicated objectives and if

559
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,480
we are not going to

560
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,240
speak with vendors especially cyber

561
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,000
security vendors if we're not going to

562
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,960
close

563
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,480
work closely with them or getting

564
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,080
integrated with them then we're not

565
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,760
going to solve their problems on such

566
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,919
quality level he needs

567
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,760
that's why this close cooperation

568
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,320
partially

569
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,720
[Music]

570
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,080
some provide less information some are

571
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,799
trying to get close

572
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,360
but if the client wants to

573
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,080
integrate some of their products

574
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,600
which means make them better

575
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,360
then vendors will have to improve and be

576
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,960
more competitive

577
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,840
so the current situation

578
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,280
positively influences the information

579
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,280
security market because on one side we

580
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,679
see a big niche

581
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,000
or import substitution but on the other

582
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,280
side

583
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,880
the from the side of the clients there

584
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,760
is a big demand

585
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,320
and a big need

586
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,039
in reliable good quality information

587
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,720
security products

588
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,400
so with the consideration of the fact

589
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,760
that russia enters the three

590
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,320
global leaders as a country which knows

591
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,440
how to develop good quality products

592
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,240
participating and waning in a lot of

593
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,440
global olympics programming limits and

594
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,520
we do have a big

595
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,880
foundation

596
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,720
to be able to provide ourselves with

597
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,799
good quality products in the area of

598
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,480
information security and do it in such a

599
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,120
way so that inadmissible would become

600
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,400
impossible

601
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,360
so we've been speaking to mikhail levin

602
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,600
development director and georadar and

603
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,520
igor smithan and director of commercial

604
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,039
director of our vision
