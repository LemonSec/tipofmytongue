1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
i have two guests waiting here for me

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,599
he was involved and he is involved in a

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,400
software development right yeah he is a

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,519
software developer of everything that

5
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,960
surrounds us in this standoff and anton

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,720
kuzmin anton hello he represents a team

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,519
which is very important to us this is a

8
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,400
team from inner stage company and in the

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,279
course of two years if i'm not mistaking

10
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,239
there are co-organizers of our event uh

11
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,920
positive holidays and in the course of

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,960
the same amount of years they

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,399
participate in this standoff in the

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,520
beginning they've been participating in

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,520
the standoff as participants then

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,640
they've been participating in the

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,800
standoff as assistance in our global

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,600
sock and right now our global

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,800
sock

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,520
is resting somewhere in the south and

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,680
then it's being replaced by the inner

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,399
stage sock

23
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,119
well i'd like to explain it to you

24
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,080
here

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,760
these people they know which attacks did

26
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,680
happen yesterday which risks have been

27
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,479
realized or unaccessible events and who

28
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,080
is at fault for everything that is

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,320
happening so anton can you give us the

30
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,000
news from yesterday

31
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,000
well standard store in the beginning of

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,799
the event the first attacks were about

33
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,439
against web and dmz from the internet

34
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,360
side so everything which sticks out in

35
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,200
the internet

36
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,600
so yesterday couple

37
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,759
eight risks

38
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,560
of unacceptable events were

39
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,079
changing in the cost of

40
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,920
railroad tickets

41
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,399
it's a very simple event

42
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,119
and the red team had to do only one

43
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,399
action

44
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,200
basically they had to google

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,360
and it's a spoiler for the remaining

46
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,240
teams who didn't do that yet and one

47
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,119
team

48
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,799
at the end of the day was able to

49
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,479
realize realizing the same logistical

50
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,000
company i don't know why they hate it so

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,038
much

52
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,640
and personal data was leaked

53
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,840
well everything

54
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,040
as we like

55
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,840
tickets cannot be purchased personal

56
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,720
data was leaked

57
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,599
i have a question to you can you tell me

58
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,800
please

59
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,520
how were you able to do it in such a way

60
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,280
so that everything that these guys see

61
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,920
could be realized in our infrastructure

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,480
because you are responsible for all this

63
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,519
stuff

64
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,120
that's right well there's a lot of

65
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,760
stages stage number one preliminary

66
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,440
design

67
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,599
and thinking about the vectors of

68
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,519
attacks and risks and we have a lot of

69
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,680
cross-sections with other teams which

70
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,400
participate and make uh vulnerable

71
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,640
services including our hakas which can

72
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,760
bring their own experience and things

73
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,440
that we see in a lot of other projects

74
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,400
so integration with the replica and then

75
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,120
we have big automation team which helps

76
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,920
us to deploy the infrastructure

77
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,800
and

78
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,879
send

79
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,959
all these logs to the product so that

80
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,800
our sock would be able to see all of

81
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,599
this this is being done automatically

82
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,840
and every year we're trying to cover

83
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,560
more and more areas by automations and

84
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,519
how many risks do you have 100

85
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,360
and which one of them is your favorite

86
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,920
one well my favorite one i don't know

87
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,879
this time i want to see more of them

88
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,879
realized so that it would look more

89
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,799
effectively more powerfully so that

90
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,040
everybody would do something hackers and

91
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,680
defenders so we hope that in the next

92
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,720
three days we are going to be happy

93
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,879
viewers of all this fun

94
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,120
okay anton they

95
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,720
he didn't tell me about his favorite

96
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,400
risks i'm not going to ask you about

97
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,319
favorite risks you should hate them from

98
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,799
the very beginning as i understand right

99
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:01,599
no

100
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,599
no however

101
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,799
can you tell me please which risks do

102
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,280
you expect but according to your opinion

103
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,560
is the most interesting one

104
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,798
last year we've been expecting until red

105
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,759
team would come to the scada and in the

106
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,120
latest hours they were able to reach it

107
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,560
i hope it's going to happen a little bit

108
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,639
earlier this year because yesterday

109
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,160
those people who've been working and

110
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,320
working there already

111
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,160
get to the core city

112
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,400
so it's going to be a very hot level not

113
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,320
only networking perimeter but even

114
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,280
deeper so we're waiting when people will

115
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,759
get to scanda

116
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,360
and we're going to

117
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,000
show beautiful eight nine hubs and it's

118
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,800
gonna be interesting

119
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,160
well i'm going to discover a secret

120
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,520
dosco watchers it's not a secret for you

121
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,800
in addition to the fact that our

122
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,199
attackers can realize business risks

123
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,320
in our cyber field in our cyber exercise

124
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,199
they can also

125
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,280
change vulnerabilities and search for

126
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,280
vulnerabilities so which one of you uh

127
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,199
those of you who will

128
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,919
who receives vulnerability or reports

129
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,360
you do

130
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,680
okay then i'll ask you a lot of

131
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,880
questions

132
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,039
i know that

133
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,880
64 vulnerability reports have been

134
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,280
submitted and i think that it's a big

135
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,840
number for first day is that right or

136
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,160
not and which vulnerabilities and what's

137
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,160
interesting

138
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,360
well it's not me it's a big team who

139
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,639
received those vulnerability of reports

140
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,639
it's a big number

141
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,800
and all these reports have been accepted

142
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,880
well not many of them have been accepted

143
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,120
actually speaking

144
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,039
because some of them are not completed

145
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,960
we ask them to recheck them and then

146
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,800
they submit them so the percentage is

147
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,400
not a big one

148
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,039
some of them had to be resubmitted

149
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,960
but speaking generally according to my

150
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,360
evaluation approximately 10

151
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,199
nodes

152
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,680
10 nodes have already been attacked from

153
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,199
the vulnerability point of view and that

154
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,199
were different vulnerabilities

155
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,759
injections sql injections so the

156
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,240
complete set that we are expecting from

157
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,000
hackers

158
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,639
vulnerabilities in web applications and

159
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,960
we are placing them usually outside the

160
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,880
perimeter so it's going to be like an

161
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,479
entry point

162
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,520
to see proactive actions from hackers

163
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,960
thank you

164
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,600
olek told us that these vulnerability

165
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,840
reports are being sent to

166
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,960
beginners

167
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,960
newbies but you work with other reports

168
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,960
as i understand you'll receive reports

169
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,479
from defenders because we have a

170
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,280
defender team here and the defender team

171
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,360
observes everything that happens with

172
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,240
our standoff and they are not

173
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,240
resisting attackers but they should

174
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,960
describe their actions as

175
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,400
detailed as possible so that global

176
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,840
professor

177
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,520
would tell us that everything is

178
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,199
understandable everything is wonderful

179
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,560
and everything's beautiful so in the

180
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
course of yesterday they have submitted

181
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,240
48 incident reports from defenders can

182
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,400
you tell me what kind of a defender

183
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,280
submitted incident reports are and when

184
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,240
these unacceptable events were realized

185
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,240
lesser than we expected what about these

186
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,960
numbers well it's a simple story the

187
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,680
blue team has two objectives

188
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,759
main objective is to investigate

189
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,160
unex unallowable events which already

190
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,759
have been realized

191
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,680
and this investigation consists of

192
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,120
certain steps

193
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,919
story number one the web has been broken

194
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,639
story number two they penetrated into

195
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,560
the corporate network etc and there is a

196
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,039
certain number of steps

197
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,120
which are brought together into this

198
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,599
kill chain objective number two for the

199
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,280
blue team

200
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,199
before unacceptable event has been

201
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,240
realized each of these steps can be

202
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,199
submitted as an atomic incident so they

203
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,800
see a certain informational security

204
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,960
violation for example some mimikat has

205
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,319
been downloaded and they tried to

206
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,319
violate the password it's an incident

207
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,759
and these are the reports they've been

208
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,879
submitting yesterday they've seen

209
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,639
certain violations they've seen certain

210
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,639
attacks which has not led to

211
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,479
unacceptable event but they still have

212
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,240
been submitting them okay

213
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,240
clearing up question i've been looking

214
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,240
at the statistics of what was happening

215
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,200
in the course of last 24 hours

216
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,240
and it did happen that leaders report

217
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,120
leaders were defenders in a banking

218
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,159
sphere

219
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,560
hello bank defenders so can you tell me

220
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,399
at least what they've been submitting

221
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,640
how the banking sphere was attacked and

222
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,040
which reports were submitted

223
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,720
well honestly speaking there were a lot

224
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,120
of fishing stories there were a lot of

225
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,120
attempts

226
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,240
of different web injections

227
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,279
and attempts of

228
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,560
getting hold

229
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,440
on so the red teams were trying to get

230
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,720
hold

231
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,399
we have very

232
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,959
experienced defenders so they know what

233
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,518
to do
