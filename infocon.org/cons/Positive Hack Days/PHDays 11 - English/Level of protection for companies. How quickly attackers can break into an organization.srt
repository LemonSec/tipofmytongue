1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,879
can every company be broken right now

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,240
we're going to speak about the level of

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,240
company defense

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,719
and how fast criminals can break into

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,160
organizations and we're going to speak

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,920
about it together with alexander moroz

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,440
of the head of uh

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,080
testing penetrate pen testing

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,000
department in positive technologies

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,240
hello sasha hello vladimir

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,439
okay let's begin with the main question

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,880
can every company be broken it's a very

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,920
good question but it's also a wide

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,040
question

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,280
so i will make

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,200
sure i will give you a wide response

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,160
first of all in the beginning i would

18
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,879
like to tell you what do we do

19
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,440
which projects do we have types of the

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,360
projects and i can tell you also about

21
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,440
approaches to

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,760
hacking

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,960
so you decided to prepare us yours we're

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,800
doing this this and this and this and

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,120
yes every company can be broken in okay

26
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,120
wonderful wonderful can you do it well

27
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,640
you wanted to hear my reaction i gave

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,400
you i gave it to you

29
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,720
well uh we have a more scientific

30
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,200
discussion right that's why i would like

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,080
to convey to our viewers the full volume

32
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,960
of information okay let's look at it

33
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,880
we do projects we analyze external

34
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,119
perimeter defense and the simplest

35
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,280
example of the external perimeter

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,200
is the website of the company we analyze

37
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,119
the level of internal infrastructure

38
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,520
defense and the 99 percent on the case

39
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,320
speaking about the internal

40
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,759
infrastructure we mean domain of the

41
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,159
microsoft active directory so this is a

42
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,960
must-have for most of the companies

43
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,079
so these are accounts which everybody

44
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,720
has authorization mail authorization how

45
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,720
to work in the internal network well

46
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,479
simplifying this situation yes you're

47
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,479
right

48
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,600
information level of the users we do

49
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,079
phishing distributions test phishing

50
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,240
distributions also we analyze wireless

51
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,878
networks uh security also we analyze

52
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,560
security of the access control systems

53
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,920
rfid cards for the access to

54
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,000
physical office or to a certain room in

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,400
the office

56
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,120
this is not the biggest part of our work

57
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,800
so from this point of view i'm not going

58
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,599
to emphasize too much so you're looking

59
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,680
at what can be broken then you check the

60
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,519
possibility of this vulnerability in the

61
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,480
company to all possible vectors all

62
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,280
different uh ways of accessing wi-fi of

63
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,599
id cards a corporate network possibility

64
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,680
of getting connected to a from the

65
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,879
external network to some infrastructural

66
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,760
facility yes these are projects where we

67
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,640
are not limited by one vector

68
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,599
and we have complex big projects very

69
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,519
often they are related with the red team

70
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,519
specifics when armed work is also being

71
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,480
responded by the internal defense team

72
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,560
but most of our work

73
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,720
is done on the basis of the contract on

74
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,920
the basis of the desire of any client to

75
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,599
check something at this point of time

76
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,239
like simulation of the hacker behavior

77
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,480
yes yes something like that

78
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,280
each of these projects

79
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,280
is one or another side of a simulation

80
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,440
of hacker activities okay let's go back

81
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,760
to your question can any company be

82
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,120
broken

83
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,159
well what's good about it

84
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,879
anything that can be measured is good

85
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,080
let's look at the numbers upon the

86
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,959
results of our work our colleagues

87
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,519
from the analytical team

88
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:44,799
they make

89
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,680
the annual statistical reports which are

90
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,080
publicly accessible of course without

91
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,840
any personification

92
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,680
you will not be able to find names of

93
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,319
the clients but these statistical uh

94
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,040
reports are available in our

95
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,120
ptsecurity.com internet site and

96
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,799
i would like to suggest i would like to

97
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,280
recommend you please compare those

98
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,480
reports for several recent years

99
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,280
and

100
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,640
from what is available right now

101
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,680
it's the analysis of our work for the

102
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,239
period

103
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,839
second half of 2020 and first six months

104
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,600
of 2021.

105
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,919
so the numbers for this period are

106
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,840
following the external perimeter

107
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,960
was broken into in ninety three percent

108
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,960
of cases by pen tester so if you would

109
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,520
take 93 if you take hundred companies 93

110
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,000
of them can be broken in from the

111
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,440
external perimeter

112
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,680
speaking about internal infrastructure

113
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,240
so from outside like i'm sitting here in

114
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,360
the network and i can get connected to

115
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,639
the infrastructure of that company

116
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,199
respectively to where am i located yes

117
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,680
you're absolutely right you're just a

118
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,800
person with a notebook and the internet

119
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,360
you don't have any privileges in the

120
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,199
company you don't have any accounts in

121
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,919
the company you just start from the

122
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,000
scratch from the street well roughly

123
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,080
speaking from the street

124
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,960
then

125
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,320
speaking about internal infrastructure

126
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,120
analysis speaking about getting maximum

127
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,440
privileges in the domain this number

128
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,720
will be even higher it's going to be 100

129
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,039
so in 100 of the cases you will get

130
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,120
privileges on the level of domain

131
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,720
administrator or similar

132
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,600
sorry

133
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,720
which means if you are getting connected

134
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,479
from inside of the company

135
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,600
not as a usual internet user which has a

136
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,520
laptop and the internet but you get

137
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,720
connected you have the access to

138
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,440
corporate network uh right then hundred

139
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,680
percent right yes

140
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,520
moreover i would like to

141
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,160
continue your idea very often we have

142
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,479
projects when we penetrate through the

143
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,479
external perimeter and we immediately

144
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,360
start making internal pen testing it's a

145
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,039
complex approach

146
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,120
complex projects

147
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,759
and in such cases

148
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:13,600
we in 100 of cases get admin privileges

149
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,840
well i should make a small remark what

150
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,600
are those privileges and what do they

151
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,520
give us

152
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,840
i will try to simplify everything but

153
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,240
having these rights you can enter any

154
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,360
server

155
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,960
and you can

156
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,759
execute any software on this server you

157
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,680
can enter any workstation of any

158
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,240
employee and you can execute any

159
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,680
software code

160
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,680
okay

161
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,199
in order to make it more understandable

162
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,479
for example i have

163
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,520
a file with salaries of the employees

164
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,919
so i have the file with all the salaries

165
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,880
of the employees on my laptop

166
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,240
and you can get access to it

167
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,080
yes if your workstation is in the

168
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,560
corporate domain which was compromised

169
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,280
and penetrated into of course we can get

170
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,639
access to your computer and we can

171
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,360
discover this file with the salaries of

172
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,360
the employees but if i have an access to

173
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,360
the system of money transfer if i have

174
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,639
an access to

175
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,360
some other secret information system

176
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,800
we can do observation over your computer

177
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,120
and we can launch

178
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,319
any

179
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,520
software we can emulate any actions that

180
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,000
you can do on your own laptop uh

181
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,919
and i would like to make another remark

182
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,120
coming back to the numbers

183
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,479
this 100

184
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,919
number that i was calling in the

185
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,080
beginning

186
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,520
about the analysis of the internal

187
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,919
infrastructure this hundred percent as a

188
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,720
number follows us all the years since

189
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,120
our department exists so the situation

190
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,280
is not improving from year to year

191
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,400
however

192
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,879
attentive viewers they have noticed uh

193
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,639
that we are speaking about something

194
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,720
that was happening one year ago and this

195
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,960
statistical information ends in the

196
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,199
middle of the year 2021. do you have any

197
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,160
fresh information yes we do

198
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,639
and right now we'll give you a spoiler

199
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,039
because this analytical report has not

200
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,400
been published yet however

201
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,599
right now

202
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,120
serious if you will look at the

203
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,720
data from the beginning of the year 2021

204
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,759
until today

205
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,080
of penetration to the external perimeter

206
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,958
is also on the level of 100

207
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,559
which means

208
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,679
that every company

209
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,279
at least from our statistical

210
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,920
information any company can be

211
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,560
penetrated into

212
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,760
from outside

213
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,760
by any person with a notebook and

214
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,560
internet

215
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,560
previously it was 93 and right now it's

216
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,800
100 because you have improved your

217
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,680
skills or the defense uh became worse

218
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,160
of course i highly evaluate the level of

219
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,880
professionalism of my team and from year

220
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,680
to year it becomes better and better

221
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,480
so partially it's a success

222
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,959
of the skillfulness of my team but on

223
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,839
the other side it tells us that

224
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,589
[Music]

225
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,440
as you could break into many companies

226
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,839
before the same companies can be broken

227
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,920
into right now and right now we have

228
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,000
this round number 100

229
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,839
this is awful things you're telling me

230
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,519
about

231
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,480
yeah we'll cut it away

232
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,920
company

233
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,680
you can break into

234
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,279
so many companies and there's a lot of

235
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,560
little organizations which have access

236
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,399
uh and they have a lot of important

237
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,320
financial information available in their

238
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,480
networks which means that all of them

239
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,279
can be can become

240
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,680
victims of hacker

241
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,160
which means that hackers can be anywhere

242
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,040
this is the main conclusion that we

243
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,079
might come to after my story and yes

244
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,440
unfortunately this is the situation

245
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,040
can you tell me please which are the

246
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,200
most vulnerable places from the point of

247
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,480
view of penetration

248
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,560
how hackers break into companies usually

249
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,360
you mean

250
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,360
testing the external perimeter or

251
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,120
anything else what what is the most

252
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,399
typical

253
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,279
penetration

254
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,680
tactics of hackers how they get inside

255
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,959
of the company well i understand your

256
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,000
question speaking about

257
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,079
real criminals

258
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,959
not about ethical pen testers and we are

259
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,519
those but speaking about real criminals

260
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,480
who don't approve any actions with the

261
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,959
company and they have certain

262
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,079
uh money-making motives

263
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,760
in most of the cases 57 of their cases

264
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,519
of initial penetration is using social

265
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,800
engineering methods

266
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,760
what are those let's discover them

267
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,560
which social engineering is mostly

268
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,079
applicable just recently i had a

269
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,760
situation

270
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,760
i get a call

271
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,760
you get a call

272
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,560
and in a rough voice without any

273
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,600
introduction person ask me

274
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,440
can you give your phone to your wife

275
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,880
they've been asking me to give my phone

276
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,360
to my wife

277
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,560
i stop the call and then immediately

278
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,680
they call me back from other numbers to

279
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,760
my number and this is also social

280
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,240
engineering it's not directed to

281
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,079
penetrate into the infrastructure of the

282
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,000
company of the employer but it's

283
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,120
directed against me as a human being and

284
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,200
it was the first time when i've been

285
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,800
attacked like that and this is also

286
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,600
developing

287
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,160
which are the most vulnerable places on

288
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,360
the side of the

289
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,880
social engineering and working with

290
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,959
people

291
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,760
you are right the methods of criminals

292
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,920
are developing

293
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,040
and this case was directed against your

294
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,360
bank accounts

295
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,920
but not access to the company that where

296
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,760
you work but speaking about getting

297
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,839
access

298
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,639
to

299
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,600
corporate infrastructure first of all i

300
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,720
should point out methods of

301
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,760
facing distributions

302
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,240
when user

303
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,880
receives a malicious code or the link to

304
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,880
malicious code

305
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,399
so this is an outdated method because a

306
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,519
fishing

307
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,000
distributions they've started long time

308
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,880
ago since nigerian spam

309
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,720
when rich

310
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,040
heir

311
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,000
of big amount of money of a certain

312
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,959
prince which lives in some african

313
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,240
country

314
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,959
is asking you to participate

315
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,480
in a scheme

316
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,440
of a money distribution and in order for

317
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,120
her to get this

318
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,040
heritage she'll give you 100 bucks it's

319
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,160
an old way and people still are

320
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,600
fighting for this yes it still works

321
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,519
and we do have a lot of statistics on

322
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,120
these

323
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,079
and i will compare

324
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,120
far-fetching

325
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,639
situations for example if you look at

326
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,639
the year 2017

327
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,399
according to our statistics

328
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,079
sixteen percent of users

329
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,720
which received uh the malicious letters

330
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,839
sixteen percent of users

331
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,000
have launched these malicious code and

332
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,199
eleven percent of users

333
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,959
followed external link

334
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,959
and they have introduced their

335
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,000
authentication data

336
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,480
if you look at the year 20 and 21 and if

337
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,320
you look at their statistics it's going

338
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,199
to be much worse

339
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,639
and the launch of malicious file was

340
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,160
done by 31 of users and following the

341
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,079
link and introduction of authentication

342
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,040
data was done by 39 percent of users so

343
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,680
they don't learn anything yeah they

344
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,839
they are even forgetting about what they

345
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,880
have learned previously

346
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,360
i think this is forever with us

347
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,680
i wouldn't be such a fatalist i think

348
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,959
earlier or later our security will

349
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,680
become absolute

350
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,360
and it will reach zero however it will

351
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,760
still be viable for a long period of

352
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,839
time so the most vulnerable piece is

353
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,480
social engineering human beings phishing

354
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,079
emails they follow the link they put in

355
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:08,959
some

356
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,160
account data

357
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,320
step one step two and that's it

358
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,480
well speaking about the

359
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,600
real tactics of real fraudsters who

360
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,639
follow lucrative uh motives these are

361
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,959
fishing distributions

362
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,800
okay let's speak about different

363
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,000
industries is the level of security and

364
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,800
the level of protection uh against

365
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,240
hacker attacks depending from which

366
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,959
industry is this financial manufacturing

367
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,880
transportation

368
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,279
yes this is a good question okay let's

369
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,000
look in this direction first of all i

370
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,480
would like to tell you that it depends

371
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,720
first of all on the company and on a

372
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,279
team of i.t specialists that work with

373
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,519
this company but if you will compare uh

374
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,600
in white strokes if you will compare

375
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,240
different industries then perhaps

376
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,160
i can say that ahead of everybody from

377
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,320
the level of defense credit and

378
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,000
financial sector is ahead of everybody

379
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,959
and this is cognitively understandable

380
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,360
from the basic point of view because

381
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,279
financial sector

382
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,519
involves leaving money

383
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,639
and

384
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,680
when

385
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,399
criminal penetrates into a bank

386
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,600
with the availability of certain rights

387
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,240
to which he gains access he can transfer

388
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,480
to the swift system to the account he

389
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,079
owns or she owns or get access to the

390
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,600
atm network and launch malicious file

391
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,399
which will give a command for uh

392
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,600
printing out the full balance of the atm

393
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,360
but if you will look at this from the

394
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,680
position of numbers

395
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,680
as you know right now we actively

396
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,320
develop the topic of resultative cyber

397
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,040
security

398
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,880
maybe our viewers don't know about it

399
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,880
but can you tell me about this

400
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,199
yeah with a great pleasure

401
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,520
well resultative cyber security and i

402
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,879
will tell you in my own words

403
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,599
it's the security which is oriented at

404
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,359
result but what do we mean by that

405
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,280
very often

406
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,439
cyber security companies are perceived

407
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,959
as a certain type of process

408
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,960
there are some kids

409
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,720
which do something with their computers

410
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,799
they have a small budget and they should

411
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,520
continue and do their security they will

412
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,160
install antiviral uh

413
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,919
software but if something very serious

414
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,080
happens with the company and we've been

415
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,720
discussing it with alexey novikov when

416
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,880
some inadmissible events might happen

417
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,320
with the company when big amounts of

418
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,440
money are being transferred for the

419
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,120
company or malicious card will be

420
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,039
executed in the source code if it's a

421
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,120
technological company

422
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,880
then who's going to be responsible for

423
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,960
all of this

424
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,440
so first of all responsibility from the

425
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,600
side of top management second of all

426
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,000
department

427
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,480
information security department as a

428
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,080
partner which provides

429
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,080
protection from these situations and not

430
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,640
just formally any paper but actually

431
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,720
being able to avoid it that's what i

432
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,360
call resultative cyber security changing

433
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,000
the perception of cyber security inside

434
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
of the organization increasing its

435
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,600
priorities and the result

436
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,640
that non-admissible events will never

437
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,039
happen

438
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,000
well it did work

439
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
what i wanted to tell you about if you

440
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
will approach the question of

441
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,320
resultative cyber security in a

442
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,080
formalized manner we have to speak about

443
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,640
those events which should become

444
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,520
inadmissible for example if hacker

445
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,000
entered the bank he will never get

446
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,720
access to the atm network or if the

447
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,799
criminal have entered the production

448
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,039
factory he will never get access to

449
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,080
technological processes so

450
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,000
the product of calculating we do have a

451
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,640
number of projects as risk verification

452
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,720
when clients are coming to us the

453
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,640
factory the bank or any other

454
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,720
organization and they tell us we have

455
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,240
the list of those risks which are

456
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,160
inadmissible okay let's look at whether

457
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,679
you're going to be available to reach

458
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,000
them for us in a certain period of time

459
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,720
usually this is one month

460
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,960
and i do have certain numbers so let's

461
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,280
look at them

462
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,600
speaking about the industrial sector and

463
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,440
i'm speaking about factories plants

464
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,280
in the course of first month

465
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,840
we can realize 87 percent of

466
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,799
inadmissible events 87 of these

467
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,679
inadmissible events in the industry yes

468
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,679
speaking about the financial sector

469
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,760
speaking about banks

470
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,880
inside of them this number will reach 62

471
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,880
percent this is still a lot

472
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,000
nevertheless it's still more than 50

473
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,480
so we do have a big difference in these

474
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,720
numbers that's why answering your

475
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,200
question i can confidently tell you that

476
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,280
according to our experience the more

477
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,400
protected

478
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,840
financial organizations are more

479
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,960
protected what do you think the certain

480
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,200
measures are being adopted from their

481
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,320
side to protect them or maybe it happens

482
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,960
just like that

483
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,679
well i don't think that it happens

484
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,480
accidentally it's a complex of measures

485
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,080
which are being taken

486
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,120
and it involves higher budgets in the

487
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,880
i.t sector

488
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,640
second of all

489
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,520
this is a more proper approach to hr

490
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:59,360
policy and to forming defense team

491
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,640
also this is a consequence of team

492
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,799
building proper processes

493
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,559
the final question that i would like to

494
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,240
ask you about not about companies not

495
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,679
about corporations but i would like to

496
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,039
ask you about humans about people

497
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,280
devices in my pocket i might have a

498
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,679
phone and i do have certain things which

499
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,840
i consider

500
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,600
inaccessible for example leakage by

501
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,240
photos some banking data access to

502
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,600
social networks

503
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,120
doesn't matter

504
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,960
different people have a lot of different

505
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,679
important information

506
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,440
tax deal so as for me as for the person

507
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,000
how should i make these inadmissible

508
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,640
events impossible so that hackers would

509
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,520
not be able to find this key

510
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,840
to me

511
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,360
well it's a big question

512
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,120
i will give you certain basic

513
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,159
recommendations everything else will

514
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,200
depend on specifics of every certain

515
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,880
person well we are not going to speak

516
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,600
about long passwords can you give me a

517
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,640
more interesting advice well vladimir

518
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,640
you put me in a dead end this is the

519
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,559
first thing i wanted to tell you yes

520
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,840
simple passwords it's a very big problem

521
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,919
insufficient password policy

522
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,280
passwords should be very complicated and

523
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,520
unique

524
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,120
so that if you compromise service a you

525
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,280
would not be able to use this password

526
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,000
to compromise the service b

527
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,080
on the side of the same user so if the

528
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,559
user

529
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,960
i don't know

530
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,039
one password should not be used for all

531
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,760
the services and this password should

532
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,600
not be in his work computer

533
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,400
okay that's number one number two we've

534
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,760
been speaking a lot about social

535
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,200
engineering

536
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,159
so we need to differentiate legitimate

537
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,880
letters from letters which are sent by

538
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,880
criminals how

539
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,440
how can we see this difference

540
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,360
it doesn't say well in the subject this

541
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,120
is a letter from criminal

542
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,360
it's not a legitimate letter

543
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,960
well if

544
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,080
you

545
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,520
suddenly receive a letter from nigerian

546
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,760
relative which offers you to participate

547
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,760
in interesting scheme

548
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,240
on uh laundering several millions of

549
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,640
dollars it's fraud it's understandable

550
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,600
so look at some doubtful topics

551
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,559
if you receive a letter with the

552
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,200
attached file that you don't expect and

553
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,200
this might be not just executable file

554
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,679
with xe or scr

555
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,600
but it can be injection

556
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,240
even a document a microsoft word

557
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,559
document regular office documents can be

558
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,039
an injection

559
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,520
launch it in a sandbox or better better

560
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,000
ignore it and don't launch it at all and

561
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,279
well not speaking about phishing

562
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,679
if the file was coming from the internet

563
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,520
you should look at it with a certain

564
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,320
level of doubt and

565
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,799
your main working machine

566
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,840
don't launch all the executable files on

567
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,760
your computer any final question for

568
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,840
them i have an iphone and i don't care

569
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,470
do i leave an illusion or is it true

570
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,480
[Music]

571
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,520
well

572
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,960
well well

573
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,240
as for iphone in our department we have

574
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,120
a department which is involved in the

575
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,360
safety of mobile devices

576
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,240
do you have an interview with caller

577
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,080
from this department yes i do have this

578
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,600
interview i'm going to have and you can

579
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,200
address this question to him from your

580
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,960
point of view of the iphone computer

581
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,400
iphone is a computer with a certain

582
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,240
software

583
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,840
and this computer has a number of

584
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,880
vulnerabilities as well so

585
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,919
speaking about publish

586
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,799
vulnerabilities

587
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,919
ios has a certain number of coe

588
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,720
identifiers which tells us that it does

589
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,120
have vulnerabilities and they can be

590
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,760
exploited by criminals

591
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,760
okay thank you very much sasha we've

592
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,919
been speaking with alexander morozov and

593
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,760
we've been speaking about that any

594
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,480
company can be penetrated and not only

595
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,039
the company and any human because we all

596
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,440
are surrounded by digital devices and

597
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,039
iphone is not an armor

598
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,080
it's the same computer but a small one

599
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,480
and nice looking one in your pocket

600
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,679
so please be careful

601
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,000
and

602
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,760
unadmissible things that you're afraid

603
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,240
of in your digital world shouldn't

604
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,279
happen

605
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,320
