well-known company a well-established

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,479

what happened and what is still

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,280
happening in the company no final

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,600
decision has been taken by the company

40
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,360
yet we are

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,119

paying for the vacation

44
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,360
uh the company is paying uh

45
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,079
venus and the company continues to be in

46
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,920
operation

47
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,079
at least

48
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,079
if formally

49
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,759
the situation continues to be

50
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,360
challenging we are waiting for the final

51
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,040
decision where sure the decision will

52
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,920
follow

53
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,560
uh soon uh it's been already three

54
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,520
months

55
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,600
not just cisco but other companies as

56
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,399
well

57
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,119
that had this uh uh they put themselves

58
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,280
on hold to take a decision i think that

59
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,760
in the next two maybe three weeks we

60
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,239
will find out how it's going to happen

61
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,720
in the future

62
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,480
how about

63
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,200
how about this this rumor uh

64
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,400
have you heard that mcdonald's uh is

65
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,840
going to continue operating in russia

66
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,840
now there's mcdonald's but

67
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,200
uh don mack uh what about

68
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,640
do you think

69
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,560
it's possible that cisco will be

70
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,160
will continue we'll stay in version of

71
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,840
cisco but it's called cso or something

72
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,920
well no that's a

73
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,400
funny story but uh

74
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,959
dot mac

75
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,959
dark mark is using

76
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,959
products that are made in russia right

77
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,519
they use russian raw materials while all

78
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,400
foreign vendors

79
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,879
have they have operations in the country

80
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,400
uh

81
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,239
with raw materials basically with

82
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,000
feedstock with the hardware software

83
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,680
that's not made in russia so i don't

84
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,959
think that it companies will be able to

85
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,599
perform that trick

86
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,239
yes unfortunately in cisco i don't think

87
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,840
there is a single infrastructure in

88
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,840
russia that i would not have a piece of

89
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,159
cisco equipment in it

90
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,560
so it's a serious blow to infrastructure

91
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,040
it's it's not a blow it's a challenge

92
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,000
it's a challenge okay a challenge

93
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,120
because hardware continues to work

94
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,260
and if the

95
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,000
[Music]

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,400
customer set everything up correctly

97
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,959
from the very beginning the

98
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,040
hardware will continue to work if they

99
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,480
had blr licenses from the start then it

100
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,840
will not affect anything for some people

101
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,319
nothing changed for some many things

102
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,799
change changed but it's alive it's

103
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,480
security will leave

104
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,799
under constant

105
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,560
instability

106
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,640
it's another

107
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,439
uncertainty you see either companies

108
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,840
were ready

109
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,519
for this and so they were not for the

110
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:16,720
employees of the company it was an

111
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,478
unpleasant uncertainty

112
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,399
an unpleasant risk yesterday we talked

113
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,479
to different distributors and uh marvel

114
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,720
said that the network equipment that

115
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,680
cisco has a big share of

116
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,600
it can be quite easily replaced

117
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,800
with oriental uh products uh the

118
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,720
products from china and from other

119
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,560
countries of the orient do you think

120
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,000
that this substitution is possible

121
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,800
because i mean it's not a quick process

122
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,639
right in a corporate infrastructure but

123
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,800
if the customers set themselves the goal

124
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,639
can it happen

125
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,520
well i think it's not realistic

126
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,639
accidental eastern chinese

127
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,000
suppliers suppliers today do not deliver

128
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,440
anything to the russian market today

129
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,639
they are also

130
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,280
placing their operations on hot and hold

131
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,080
in order to make a replacement you need

132
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,720
to test everything it will take months

133
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,520
it will take years 18 months at least

134
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,120
and if you remember about the

135
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,360
presidential decree number 250 on upper

136
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,280
substitution means that by 2025 everyone

137
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,960
should be

138
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,160
uh should be without foreign-made

139
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,440
products

140
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,280
be they made in

141
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,919
north america south america uh

142
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,199
israel or the far east so switching out

143
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,840
to chinese products it's another

144
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,400
slow action mine

145
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,360
is another

146
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,479
delayed action mine is a time bomb

147
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,600
because there may be another

148
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,639
presidential decree in the making

149
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,080
that will

150
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,639
that will prohibit all foreign made

151
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,720
equipment

152
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,639
are you talking to

153
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,520
other

154
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,440
employees of foreign companies how

155
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,280
pessimistic are they

156
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,560
well at the moment uh we

157
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,560

we are

166

studying at various uh

167
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,800
various online causes

168
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,479
we are getting used to it

169
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,680
are people are people

get better some have already found a new

174

employment

175
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,400
uh just like

176
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,479
from the other side of the market people

177
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,680
are looking for

178
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,319
new employees i mean today

179
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,120
uh

180
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,199
and also russian companies are looking

181
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,400
to hire

182
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,560
people who used to be employed by

183
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,639
foreign companies because those

184
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,880
employees have experience of

185
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,800
international culture

186
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,599
so i mean i think that around june time

187
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,280
the companies will finally decide what

188
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,720
they are going to do and i think the

189
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,599
decision will be to leave

190
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,240
or not

191
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,919
the russian employees of foreign

192
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,720
companies how many of them

193
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,400
expect to

194
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,520
get back

195
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,560
to you know the old to the old tracks

196
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,080
and how many are looking for new

197
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,280
employment well i think that

198
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,960
maybe one percent are thinking that

199
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,880
things will be uh

200
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,639
as they were before

201
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,479
not more than one percent yes many are

202
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,919
already in the process of allocation

203
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,919
many are looking for new jobs many are

204
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,440
waiting for a good uh

205
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,560
uh

206
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,879
farewell salary they are looking for new

207
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,440
jobs really we mean the

208
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,280
majority understands that things aren't

209
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,479
going to be the same anymore and

210
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,720
if the company says that i'm pausing my

211
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,520
operation in terms of security i mean of

212
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,560
course

213
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,479
customers will

214
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,280
have questions to such a vendor uh in

215
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,759
the future so i mean people already

216
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,800
thinking whether uh even if the company

217
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,720
decides to stay will they be able to

218
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,000
trust it and trust in insecurity is the

219
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,319
cornerstone so it's not going to be the

220
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,000
same as it was some have already left

221
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,599
according to your

222
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,279
data or your feeling

223
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,279
how many of the russian

224
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,559
employees of foreign companies have

225
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,958
already relocated to foreign lands

226
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,360
well it's hard to say

227
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,720
it's not a

228
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,399
quick process

229
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,959
yes well some companies say that they

230
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,720
are allocating whole offices well i

231
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,279
think it's amazing before you reallocate

232
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,680
you need to arrange for work visas some

233
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,800
countries

234
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,240
take 20 30 weeks to process a working

235
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,279
visa

236
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,399
so it's it takes time some people moved

237
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,720
of their own accords and they're looking

238
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,160
for jobs themselves some people are

239
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,920
waiting for the company to

240
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,160
reallocate them some people have applied

241
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,040
for a reallocation so i think about 15

242
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,600
20 percent will definitely leave

243
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,640
and others will

244
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,120
probably think of a temporary

245
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,120
reallocation to some neighboring

246
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,440
countries like kazakhstan or armenia

247
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,600
maybe serbia

248
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,560
to

249
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,640
cater to eastern european markets but

250
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,880
others will still be on the lookout you

251
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,399
have to understand not only please or

252
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,399
foreign companies

253
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,839
here will be in demand in the uh foreign

254
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,160
countries if it's a highly skilled

255
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,480
worker then yes probably that person

256
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,760
will be hunted

257
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,320
but if it was just a salesperson you

258
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,720
know when i was an irregular salesperson

259
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,600
probably that person will not be hunted

260
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,560
by say americans and that person will

261
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,640
stay in russia if the an employee

262
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,480
generates money then the employee will

263
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,279
be

264
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,760
valued if not than that

265
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,440
i also heard the story that russian

266
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,240
developers russian coders russians by

267
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,560
origin even if they work abroad and even

268
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,800
if they work in foreign companies they

269
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,200
uh stop getting access to important

270
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,680
components to the

271
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,040
nucleus to uh to you know to

272
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,279
the important components of software so

273
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,160
there's kind of mistrust emerging to

274
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,160
russian

275
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,000
developers well i think it was uh on the

276
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,640
spur of the moment if the employee was

277
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,560
not loyal to the company that that

278
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,560
person could have done anything before

279
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,720
the 24th of february and the other way

280
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,040
around as well any company that today is

281
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,399
called potential

282
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,640
enemy could have done anything before

283
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,640
the 24th of february and all the

284
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,800
recommendations let's not update the

285
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
software of this company it would have

286
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,880
would not have worked i mean if if they

287
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,320
could have done it they would have done

288
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,720
it already

289
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,920
speaking about updates i stopped

290
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,040
updating my iphone i know that many

291
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,040
customers are not updating the software

292
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,880
for their network equipment

293
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,560
what do you think

294
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,320
is this

295
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,760
the correct move

296
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,480
no is the wrong move it's a totally

297
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,800
wrong move especially for iphone because

298
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,279
in the iphone it's an in-built

299
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,120
function uh

300
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,440
he is states you to

301
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,519
turn it into a brick if it was stolen an

302
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,519
update is an inbuilt function you can uh

303
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,720
disconnect all interfaces and probably

304
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,120
you need to wrap it in foil but

305
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,079
otherwise

306
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,959
why would you need an iphone

307
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,279
in that in that case if the company

308
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,560
wanted to turn your hardware to stone

309
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,279
the company would have already done it

310
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,279
hearing what our regulators are talking

311
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,639
uh saying

312
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,320
the ministry of telecom or fsb they have

313
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,959
not yet confirmed a single case of when

314
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,519
hardware will be turned into a brick

315
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,200
even in the current

316
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,440
difficult circumstances foreign vendors

317
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,279
do not want to risk their reputation by

318
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,200
disconnecting the whole country

319
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,560
by making uh bricks out of hardware it

320
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,360
means i can do this everywhere anyway

321
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,760
and it will be a huge blow to the

322
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,839
reputation to the business

323
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,519
no one will be will dare to do it uh

324
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,519
well before i was also saying that no

325
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,680
one would leave the country but people

326
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,519
are living and i think that yeah even

327
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,920
this may change but i think that the

328
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,279
risks there are minimal so please update

329
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,360
and please remove the vulnerabilities

330
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,040
otherwise you are opening the door to

331
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,800
anyone who is looking for access

332
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,000
what did the whole situation mean to you

333
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,639
as a public personality is someone who

334
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,839
speaks on behalf of cisco who is a cisco

335
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,600
evangelist almost

336
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,880
uh what was

337
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,360
the impact of this whole situation

338
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,680
personally

339
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,120
it was positive for me

340
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,320
well

341
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,680
you are not

342
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,600
no longer oppressed by the foreign no no

343
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,600
no i was never oppressed

344
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,560
but already in 2014 i started including

345
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,200
the what if slides into my presentations

346
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,120
i started to consider the risks of what

347
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,720
will happen if

348
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,360
the equipment stops working from 2014 in

349
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,760
all of my presentations you will see a

350
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,160
couple of slides about the risks the

351
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,720
risks are present it's up to you how you

352
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,959
treat those risks many were saying that

353
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,279
no it was not possible but then

354
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,360
everything that we discussed in the last

355
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,079
eight years became true some were

356
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,199
already somewhere or not so um

357
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:47,600
now i can claim a prophet's glory

358
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,360
it was one of your scenarios

359
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,560
yes

360
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,320
and i was totally serious about it after

361
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,600
crimea was added to

362
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,519
russia i started considering this

363
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,360
scenario i was actually considering the

364
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,920
scenario already back in 2012. even

365
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,000
though i still am an employee of

366
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,360
the foreign company i'm more loyal to

367
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,440
security and less loyal to the vendor

368
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,279
so i always take the security

369
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,480
perspective on any event and i maintain

370
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,839
this position even today even though i'm

371
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,600
employed by a

372
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,320
an american company i

373
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,959
think first about the customer security

374
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,320
and if i see that something is not

375
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,079
secure for the customer i would advise

376
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,160
against doing it or i would explain the

377
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,959
risks and let the customers decide

378
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,519
and after the events

379
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,839
there are more webinars more

380
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,160
seminars but now you you put up a

381
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,160
disclaimer i do not speak on behalf of

382
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,800
cisco well i always discuss it in

383
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,040
advance i always discuss it in advance

384
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,360
with the organizers whether i would be

385
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,440
speaking as a cisco employee or

386
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,959
another's assistant employee because if

387
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,440
it's a cisco employee hat i'm wearing

388
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,920
then we need to pay money it's

389
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,079
corporations paperwork it's budgets it's

390
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,399
contracts exactly so usually i speak as

391
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,560
an independent expert because i mean

392
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,560
everyone understands that

393
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,120
there is no such thing as an independent

394
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,560
expert an independent expert uh he's

395
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,279
dependent uh always either the money or

396
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,959
the organizers where however

397
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,600
independence is virtually non-existent

398
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,880
in our business

399
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,040
so life is now easier for you all the

400
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,720
life didn't change for you much

401
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,480
well the life didn't change for me much

402
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,480
because i have always kept

403
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,759
corporate

404
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,279
and personal separate

405
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,440
and when i say personal personal as a

406
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,720
security

407
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,000
expert

408
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,320
what about other media personalities

409
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,800
public figures

410
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,440
in the world of information security who

411
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,600
would represent foreign vendors whose

412
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,720
behavior changed dramatically in those

413
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,959
times either they disappeared from the

414
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,680
field of vision or they started behaving

415
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,040
differently

416
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,000
judging

417
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,920
from what you're saying it didn't affect

418
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,800
you much what about others

419
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,120
other public figures

420
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,720
well we have very few um securities or i

421
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,079
mean public figures in the field of

422
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,680
information security so either these

423
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,279
people speak on behalf of their

424
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,880
companies they're just public speakers

425
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,199
on behalf of their companies and for

426
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,000
them

427
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,120
if they were russian experts nothing

428
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,759
changed for them they started

429
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,959
just mentioning well we told you

430
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,720
more often if they are representing

431
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,320
foreign companies for them there are no

432
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,680
more public

433
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,079
uh speeches they cannot speak on behalf

434
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,759
of foreign companies and they as they

435
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,079
are on vacation their own leaves at the

436
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,199
moment so for them

437
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,440
it didn't change it didn't change much

438
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,160
and also we have a fewer representatives

439
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,120
of foreign companies uh in uh various

440
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,160
events

441
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,240
because they can't speak but probably

442
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,240
soon we are going to hear from them we

443
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,800
are going to see them well we will see

444
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,720
them more often we'll see

445
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,240
what will happen to them they will

446
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,319
become visible again

447
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,720
if you are not getting ready for it

448
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,679
if you were not separating the

449
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,559
corporate and the personal

450
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,079
it may be difficult for some people

451
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,720
do you think that

452
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,679
public

453
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:24,799
persons

454
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,640
can who represent the company can't they

455
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,679
harm a company i mean everyone knows a

456
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,320
particular person as representing a

457
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,840
particular company

458
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,080
uh the person who hasn't yet been fired

459
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,600
by the company uh have not been laid uh

460
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,880
off but

461
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,320
can they harm

462
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,679
a company well because it's part of pr

463
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,520
and any

464
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,039
pr is good

465
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,440
even

466
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,880
[Music]

467
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,120
sometimes yes

468
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,120
you can have such a sleep of the turn

469
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,679
that the company will be damaged and i

470
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,760
know of cases when

471
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,400
people would be fired in just one day

472
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,760
when they said something that ran

473
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,879
contrary to corporate policy

474
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,919
speeches some companies prohibit

475
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,640
writing or saying things that are

476
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,400
against corporate policy and some

477
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,480
companies organize special trainings

478
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,360
i

479
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,760
i went uh i went to such a training

480
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,240
i went a training how not to harm a

481
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,480
company well training how to be a public

482
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,760
figure

483
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,840
what to say what not to say

484
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,799
which questions should be avoided

485
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,360
how you can maneuver

486
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,240
i am an official speaker for the company

487
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,520
i have the rights to say everything that

488
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,039
i deem to be

489
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,520
good for the company

490
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,400
so at those trainings you are told to

491
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,919
separate the corporate and the personal

492
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,320
like i said what can harm the company

493
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,440
and what not and sometimes the companies

494
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,520
have black and white lists what can be

495
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,440
said and what can't be said do's and

496
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,480
don'ts but if you know that

497
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,320
there is a lot of grey area

498
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,640
between the jews and domes

499
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,720
the companies who

500
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,880
care for their reputation very much they

501
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,440
insist on uh following only the white

502
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,679
list if the company says for me pr is

503
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,000
not to prohibit the bad things but to

504
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,679
develop the good things they say that

505
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,160
white list is okay black

506
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,799
totally definitely not okay

507
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,000
up to you

508
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,160
so and i have

509
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,960
always been associated with companies uh

510
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,840
and the current company uh is looking

511
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,000
positively on everything that i say

512
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,440
about information security even if i

513
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,880
speak as i speak as a independent expert

514
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,679
of course i cannot uh

515
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,600
dissociate myself from my employer

516
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,960
completely

517
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,240
so uh

518
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,720
it's quite easy for me but again uh the

519
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,880
word cases when

520
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,440
complaints would be filed to the company

521
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,120
about me saying something wrong there

522
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,120
was this conference once and i was

523
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,320
saying that

524
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,000
information companies

525
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,960
are in it to make the

526
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,280
and a money

527
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,679
of

528
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,600
the company i worked for

529
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,559
i received a complaint from two russian

530
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,240
players to european companies saying

531
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,080
that i'm undermining trust to uh to the

532
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,360
vendor

533
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,159
but every vendor is a

534
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,159
for-profit company there was another

535
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,600
situation when i said something about

536
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,360
the regulator and then there was a

537
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,760
complaint filed that uh i shouldn't be

538
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,880
saying something about this regulator

539
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,080
well if regulators

540
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,919
they they know my phone number they

541
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,960
could have called me and said oh you

542
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,080
should not have said that

543
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,280
but things change all the time and the

544
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,880
important thing is i've been with the

545
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,919
company for 18 years

546
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,240
and i know that you can maneuver between

547
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,159
the interests of the industry of the

548
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,200
vendor

549
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,880
of the country and your personal

550
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,480
interests my last question to you alexei

551
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,360
you personally it's been three months

552
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,840
already

553
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,559
what would be best

554
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:31,360
for

555
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,840
employees of foreign companies well i

556
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,960
wanted to

557
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,159
be the same as it was

558
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,240
working for an international employer is

559
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,720
a huge experience we get access to

560
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,559
state-of-the-art knowledge we studied

561
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,559
state-of-the-art experience

562
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,880
uh we are at the cutting edge

563
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,440
but i understand that

564
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,480
it's

565
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,640
unlikely so people will decide for

566
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,240
themselves some will say i want to

567
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,880
continue working with a foreign company

568
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,159
that's why i'm living the country and

569
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,240
others will say well that was excellent

570
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,720
experience

571
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,000
great hunt

572
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,200
but

573
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,520
i'm opening a new page

574
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,240
and maybe they will build new businesses

575
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,840
or they will start working for russian

576
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,000
employers i know some people who already

577
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,919
thinking about their startups

578
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:20,880
um

579
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,080
you know

580
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,960
relied back on the previously gained

581
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,360
experience i don't know about me

582
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,000
i'm not leaving that i know for sure but

583
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,240
as to whether i will seek employment

584
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,440
with a domestic company or i will start

585
