1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,840
security so what is autopilot in cyber

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,480
security work to speak with mikhail

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,480
palmer

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,199
technical director incompetencies center

5
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,119
hi guys

6
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,320
autopilot cyber security how these two

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,279
things work together

8
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,519
let's assemble the picture what is the

9
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,360
autopilot in the suburbs

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,559
a lot of beautiful but unclear words

11
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,919
well i would like to start

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,399
you cannot take and tell people what is

13
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,640
o2

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,039
in simple words

15
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,120
because i would like to tell everybody

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,960
why we've been developing this o2 what

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,719
were the main assumptions

18
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,879
and what was the beginning why we've

19
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,120
done

20
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,200
most of the infrastructures

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,640
where we

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,840
build incident processing systems or

23
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,159
full-scale socks

24
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,040
they are following the principle from

25
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,159
reverse why

26
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,119
because big systems

27
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,920
are generating a lot of different events

28
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,360
a few of them

29
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,640
are significant for cyber security and

30
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,520
these events have to be processed

31
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,240
somehow so that we don't process all of

32
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,560
them manually that's why we have a class

33
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,040
of solutions that we call cm

34
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,280
cm monitoring of informational security

35
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,280
events in the cm systems we're trying

36
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,479
to write rules in such a way to process

37
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,240
this event so that our attention would

38
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,920
be attracted by only a very limited

39
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,360
number of alerts

40
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,799
however

41
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,159
which number of events we're speaking

42
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,079
about these are hundreds and thousands

43
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,080
of events which are generating a lot of

44
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,239
alerts

45
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,000
and it's very complicated to work with

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,840
these alerts

47
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,280
but which number of events we're

48
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,319
speaking about thousands

49
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,920
thousands of alerts if you will pay

50
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,120
attention to what's happening in this

51
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,480
cyber

52
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,840
actions which are happening inside of

53
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,120
positive we call it a project 69 so in

54
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,080
our small infrastructure it involves

55
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,080
several hundreds of alerts

56
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,560
which monitoring service processes but

57
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,519
honestly speaking they collect them and

58
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,400
they

59
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,400
bring them to a certain perception which

60
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,319
we call an incident so this incident is

61
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,120
an entity that analytics should work

62
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,400
with in the course of his shift

63
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,080
so these are connections of certain

64
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,319
events into a certain logic

65
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,239
well the rules of correlations which

66
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,920
follow certain principles and were

67
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,239
united into an incident which has to be

68
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,239
investigated the incident of attack

69
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,319
right

70
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,238
yes incident of a complicated attack

71
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,920
standard analytical sock specialist well

72
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,360
depending on the communication of the

73
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,840
incident he

74
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,599
can look at a certain number of those

75
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,200
incidents per day and if you will pay

76
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,959
attention to the number of incidents

77
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,640
which are being registered upon the

78
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,159
results of this cyber exercise

79
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,400
approximately 30 incidents out of which

80
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,239
15 require close attention

81
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,239
and a disclosure of this incident is

82
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,640
done by several sock analytics in

83
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,640
positive technologies in the company

84
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,080
whose topical

85
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,560
engineer is cyber security our clients

86
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,080
have a totally different situation

87
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,879
because very often they have one

88
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,519
analysis person who is unachieved and he

89
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,680
can process

90
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,000
single three five seven incidents per

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,959
day

92
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,959
depending on their complexity so in such

93
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,080
a case we have to solve an objective

94
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,560
of a totally different level we have to

95
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,920
change

96
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,239
assembly of these events we have to

97
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,480
change the correlation rules and we have

98
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,799
to change those rules of which have been

99
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,319
defined for the incident so that would

100
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,878
have seven

101
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,120
because more he will not be able to

102
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,959
investigate so what is the way out of

103
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,800
this situation

104
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,800
of only automation

105
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,120
but why don't we keep everything as it

106
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,680
is because hacker is in the place where

107
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,000
we don't see him and i would like to ask

108
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,800
misha to tell you a little bit more

109
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,960
how the automation and those approaches

110
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,560
that we apply

111
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,960
how they will allow us to solve this

112
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,440
complicated problem

113
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,800
you say proper things basically speaking

114
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,199
the analytic that works

115
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,680
in sock

116
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,160
it works with different events with

117
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,120
different alerts and there's a lot of

118
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,880
them

119
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,000
when we've been developing

120
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,720
we decided that we will look at the

121
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,160
picture holistically

122
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,560
we try to discover system in them hacker

123
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,240
is not coming from nowhere he's not

124
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,759
coming from nowhere and he's not

125
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,080
disappearing nowhere so he came into the

126
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,320
infrastructure he got established there

127
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,240
he's moving somewhere and he leaves a

128
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,240
lot of footprints if you look at one

129
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,240
footprint

130
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,440
and you will not be able to see the

131
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,160
whole picture

132
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,400
so the objective of all two is to

133
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,720
collect all these links and then look at

134
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,759
them holistically

135
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,720
i can make a simple analogy there is a

136
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,039
starry sky with a lot of stars

137
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,960
so we have a similar situation we work

138
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,880
with a certain chain we have collected

139
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,360
all these events following certain logic

140
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,360
and then we try to analyze them these

141
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,199
events and these chains we have less of

142
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,240
them

143
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,000
and we simplify the work of analytics in

144
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,080
order to share

145
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,319
is there a possibility for hacker or not

146
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,840
i think so i think so so

147
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,199
it's collection of all the events

148
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,840
and providing their processing

149
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,039
automatically so that not most of people

150
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,639
would work in it but automatically it

151
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,919
should be processed yes

152
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,479
basically speaking we have a strong

153
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,680
hacker team the best in russia

154
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,919
who share this knowledge with us about

155
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,639
how they break why they do how they do

156
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,800
what is the sequence of actions and this

157
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,560
knowledge helps us to collect these

158
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,440
chains if this happens next will be this

159
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,000
so you have certain logic certain

160
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,240
expertise

161
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,680
which comes to you through the o2

162
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,240
about all the actions which are

163
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,080
conducted by hackers so o2 learns how

164
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,000
hackers are attacking yes you have

165
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,800
infrastructural sensors which inform you

166
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,880
what they see and then following this

167
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,639
knowledge and expertise of our hackers

168
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,479
we understand how all these events can

169
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,919
be interconnected into a single link

170
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,759
single chain and then we analyze this

171
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,880
chain

172
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,960
one year ago

173
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,599
you have already announced

174
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,319
that here it is this is o2 and right now

175
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,840
we're going to deliver it to the world

176
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,160
and the year have passed i would like to

177
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,560
understand which changes happened with

178
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,680
the product with its promotion and

179
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,960
development

180
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,639
well i would like to begin because i've

181
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,479
been preparing myself

182
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,919
complicated question and the most

183
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,840
interesting thing is that i hope that

184
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,960
the audience that is watching us

185
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,280
they've been witnessing

186
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,000
the birth of o2 in our ph days

187
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,800
so what about changes if you do remember

188
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,120
introduced as a system which is able to

189
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,080
discover and to stop hackers

190
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,520
at any stage of their promotion in

191
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,360
attack chain to the realization of

192
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,960
unacceptable event for the organization

193
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,039
i'm not going to remind you about

194
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,159
unacceptable events

195
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,919
no we've been speaking a lot about it

196
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,120
but what is the main idea

197
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,639
we have dialogues with our clients about

198
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,080
how are they ready to implement

199
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,360
o2 meta product very often we see the

200
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,200
situation

201
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,039
which due to a number of reasons they

202
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,519
level of maturity of the organization a

203
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,240
does not allow this organization to

204
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,800
realize this concept of inadmissible

205
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,720
events in their company what does it

206
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,160
mean

207
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,920
that the process of definition of these

208
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,240
inadmissible events can be delayed for a

209
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,519
long period of time and these

210
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,360
inadmissible events they have to be

211
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,920
verified because clients don't always

212
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,600
believe that they can be realized even

213
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,200
though from our experience we can see

214
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,480
that in 100 of cases it's possible

215
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,240
so when we've determined this in

216
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,640
inaccessible events we should see how do

217
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,279
they land in an infrastructure what are

218
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,839
those key systems whose complementation

219
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,000
compromising will help hacker to get

220
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,760
deeper in the infrastructure which are

221
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,519
those target systems by compromising

222
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,680
which these inadmissible events might

223
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,399
happen and this is a big work which very

224
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,320
often can be done only by mature

225
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,320
organizations

226
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,480
understanding this and taking into

227
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,080
consideration the diversity of the

228
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,680
clients which need functional

229
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,080
meta product oh two we made a decision

230
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,680
to understand okay what can we do

231
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,200
in order for this inevitable stage not

232
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,080
to

233
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,279
make it

234
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,480
inevitable

235
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,480
so in a product we have applied certain

236
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,120
changes which allow us to

237
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,480
extract usefulness from it as we've been

238
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,360
speaking about previously

239
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,320
without this mandatory stage of defining

240
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,240
those inadmissible events

241
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,440
it was artificial limitation

242
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,200
in the beginning we've been promoting

243
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
this product that we have to develop

244
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,120
these inadmissible events put them into

245
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,200
the infrastructure put them in a product

246
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,200
then build all the routes to which

247
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,279
hacker can move and then analyze the

248
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,680
events and routes and see which risks

249
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,440
can be as a consequence

250
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,279
but in order to discover the hacker's

251
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,920
activity and put it in a certain chain

252
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,800
it's not

253
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,560
unnecessary action this is something

254
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,320
that is going to help us to understand

255
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,399
which risk

256
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,279
hacker is moving towards to understand

257
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,480
the priority of reaction to this risk

258
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,399
of non-accepting this measure but this

259
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,600
product

260
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,839
does not depend from whether we know the

261
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,480
end goal of the criminal or not we

262
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,399
should identify this criminal in the

263
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,040
infrastructure and before he'll

264
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,640
cause uh

265
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,360
damage we should stop him

266
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,800
and o2

267
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,680
is called discover and stop

268
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,900
that's why it's called o2

269
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,480
[Laughter]

270
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,880
what no

271
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,640
it's not the only reason for these many

272
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,279
years of the product

273
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,120
maybe like that maybe like that

274
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,519
the second important factor that we have

275
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,360
defined for ourselves in the course of

276
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,600
this period of time

277
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,440
is

278
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,600
well in order to verify the hypothesis

279
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,399
that d2 is able to discover the hacker

280
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,480
and stop the hacker we on a regular

281
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,640
basis we conduct cyber training cyber

282
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,279
exercise we ask our partners to or we do

283
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,360
it by our own efforts with this company

284
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,839
and then we observe

285
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,519
what the product can do

286
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,040
so these observations you know

287
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,959
they're looking into this linux console

288
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,399
and in this fast changing line they try

289
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,160
to see something valuable same thing

290
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,240
here we collect these chains of events

291
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,200
we drop down into every separate atom

292
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,360
atomic solution in its textual

293
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,519
representation and see whether this is

294
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,839
complementation traces or the actions of

295
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,160
rit people and at this moment of time

296
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,240
you can think that

297
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,880
this is the future operators

298
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,519
the product that we uh say as the

299
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,360
autopilot for the car we don't want to

300
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,000
do that but from this moment of time the

301
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,800
product was developed through the visual

302
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,480
representation of

303
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,920
how does the chain of attack

304
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,760
penetration looks like from the moment

305
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,680
of his penetration to the moment of when

306
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,839
we are able to stop him and sometimes

307
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,399
we're saying that

308
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,360
during the previous ph days uh that

309
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,320
if we have iron nerves iron balls

310
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,160
then we can give hakka to go deeper into

311
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,839
the infrastructure knowing that we can

312
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,000
stop him at any moment of time and then

313
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,399
get a free pen test from people who are

314
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,639
located on the other side of whiteheads

315
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,160
it is important to understand

316
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,120
that when hacker is in infrastructure he

317
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,120
uses big number of different tactics

318
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,760
techniques and methods and before he is

319
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,760
able to reach certain significant

320
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,600
results

321
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,399
he will dig through a lot of

322
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,720
garbage so the people that work on this

323
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,639
visualization

324
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,639
for every technique they've developed

325
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,560
their own technical representation

326
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,720
visual representation for example the

327
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,480
hacker have compromised the system then

328
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,600
he should do

329
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,120
investigation he does this scanning

330
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,279
which is being shown on this visual

331
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,720
representation

332
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,760
uh we he got uh privileges and hosts he

333
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,320
launched a certain so the whole attack

334
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,120
will be seen

335
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,440
me as a person

336
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,440
who is not professional

337
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,120
in security operation center i've never

338
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,880
been there so if i will take this

339
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,079
beautiful interface that you're

340
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,959
describing we'll understand something

341
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,079
what would you like to understand

342
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,240
what kind of attack what kind of a

343
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,120
threat

344
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,000
of course all attacks are notified as

345
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,320
layers for example you can understand at

346
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,920
which moment of time the attack was

347
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,959
started where did it come from which

348
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,160
actions were conducted by the hacker

349
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,720
from this host and how was him moving

350
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,399
into the future and you've been speaking

351
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,519
ahead of me

352
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,680
and the magic is in the future and our

353
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,680
guys are working

354
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,440
on a real bombing feature is a player

355
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,240
when you have a special player and you

356
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,839
can

357
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,600
move this attack from its end to the

358
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,440
beginning

359
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,399
well

360
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,079
in november we're not going to have

361
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,760
anything to speak about it's a beautiful

362
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,480
spoiler

363
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,160
we'll be able to see it in november we

364
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,600
plan to

365
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,000
show it in november

366
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,279
we already have the statical

367
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,199
representation of this attack and all

368
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,720
our guests who will come and would like

369
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,959
to see that

370
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,040
we'll be able to see that even right now

371
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,399
okay the final question that i have to

372
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,160
you misha

373
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,240
what are the future plans for the

374
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,320
development of the o2 you have

375
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,279
considering this

376
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,839
showing attack in the time of its

377
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,079
development

378
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,639
replay attack

379
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,040
i can make analogy to the autopilot how

380
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,759
the autopilot was developed

381
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,199
in the beginning there was a proof of

382
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,759
concept when we just had to

383
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,759
launch a car drive several meters and

384
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,519
stop on time then

385
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,160
there was a big period of work in the

386
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,680
field when you've been working on all

387
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,279
the elements you've collected a lot of

388
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,750
data this data was analyzed

389
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,560
[Music]

390
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,600
this car goes to the street with a car

391
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,519
it drives and then

392
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,240
the next stage is when it drives around

393
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,360
the city

394
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,240
and then you can call a taxi

395
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,199
right now of course we have shown proof

396
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,040
of concept in the course of this year we

397
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,199
have assembled big amounts of data we

398
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,800
have reviewed our approaches we have

399
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,680
optimized the internal internals of the

400
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,880
software and right now we're going to

401
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,600
the next stage cyber exercise together

402
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,399
with the o2.

403
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,600
and we constantly participate in this

404
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,800
cyber exercises and we've been speaking

405
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,279
about this necessity and also

406
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,360
o2 has been used on this

407
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,720
in the positive technology

408
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,920
infrastructure so

409
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,560
perhaps we don't have any doubts that we

410
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,120
are moving in the right direction and we

411
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,040
have these technologies that we have to

412
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,000
tune up but o2 shows itself very

413
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,759
positively in positive technologies and

414
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,519
in course of next months we would like

415
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,680
to improve our concept that o2 will be

416
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,279
viable in the infrastructure of our

417
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,759
clients

418
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,480
together with early adopters and it will

419
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,480
show the results and the working concept

420
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,000
within those companies that need this

421
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,280
product

422
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,160
well honestly speaking it sounds like

423
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,559
something very revolutionary when for

424
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,599
the first time i've heard of this

425
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,799
concept i was about two years ago yeah

426
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,039
more even than two years ago i said okay

427
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,000
guys let's make this autopilot for cyber

428
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,599
security and then you think about well

429
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,360
dozens of people are working on

430
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,280
it totally different objectives but on

431
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,039
the other side i can imagine when the

432
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,039
car people have been making objective

433
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,520
okay let's make let's press a button and

434
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,039
the car will drive by itself and let's

435
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,480
do it in such a way so that the car

436
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,039
driver wouldn't even think about how the

437
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,280
car is working at that moment of time

438
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,080
this objective sounded as revolutionary

439
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,720
one and it has led to a full

440
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,320
change of the attitude towards the car

441
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,039
to automation as a process and right now

442
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,360
we are on the threshold of uh solving

443
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,400
such big objective in cyber security

444
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,360
so we are going to follow

445
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,080
these cyber exercises we are going to

446
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,280
follow

447
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,440
how the o2 is going to show itself in

448
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,600
the infrastructure and cyber exercises

449
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,760
of positive technologies please follow

450
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,760
our social networks and the next big

451
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,120
update

452
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,559
about what was happening with our

453
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,480
product is going to be given in november

454
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,080
but even right now it participates in

455
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,039
our practical exercises okay guys this

456
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,440
is crazy

457
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,480
these are those people who create this

458
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,520
product

459
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,200
yeah he's sitting so straight and jenny

460
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,440
also looks beautiful and these people

461
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,919
are responsible for making this product

462
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,840
success

463
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,000
in the infrastructure of the client okay

464
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,120
thank you very much thank you
