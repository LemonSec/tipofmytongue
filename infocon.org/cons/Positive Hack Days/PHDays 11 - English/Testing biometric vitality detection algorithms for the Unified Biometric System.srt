1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,240
i'm responsible here for

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,960
the biometric algorithms for the uniform

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,400
biometric system and i'll be talking

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,599
about

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,160
testing some of such

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,439
vitality detection algorithms

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,600
and in the course

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,320
i will be using some slang

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,279
names

10
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,760
we call it liveness

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,640
well in theory i assume that you may

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,600
have heard about it

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,320
so let's talk about

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,079
a uniform

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,879
biometric system it's a platform

16
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,760
which provides the services to the

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,960
people

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,520
in the remote channel by

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,480
biometrics

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,360
the uniform

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,840
system of biometric analysis was

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,840
recognized

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,039
as the

24
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,559
standard

25
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:05,360
and

26
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,240
it's just the same as using

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,320
the passport

28
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,400
of your identity

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,280
you

30
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,200
give out your

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,640
sample of the voice and your face

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,840
image

33
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,640
and

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,280
the storage of such biometric data

35
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,520
[Music]

36
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,159
we have a few services already that you

37
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,040
can

38
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,520
use by using

39
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,159
uniform biometric system financial

40
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,280
services

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,960
for instance or electronic sim card

42
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,640
and get mobile services and you can

43
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,960
use it if you're a student and 200

44
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,399
students for example

45
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,880
proved their identity when passing their

46
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,200
tests going through exams

47
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,799
with this biometric uniform system

48
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,800
speaking in terms of the biometric

49
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,520
systems any biometric system

50
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,200
uh can be imagined

51
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,680
in general it would be made off

52
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,599
of blocks

53
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,800
with the general functionality and

54
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,480
the actual attack

55
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,079
is possible from anywhere

56
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,319
but we are going to speak only about

57
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,959
attacks on sensor

58
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,400
like your mobile

59
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,879
phone camera attack

60
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,760
that's

61
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,319
where biometric samples take this

62
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,319
information

63
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,040
from the other attacks are also

64
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,400
important but they go outside the scope

65
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,280
and

66
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,519
they are resolved by other

67
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,560
protection means

68
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,679
so why do we need liveness

69
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,640
the use of this aliveness service

70
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,720
includes two components first of all

71
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,159
recognition

72
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,040
and the aliveness itself and if the

73
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,400
recognition

74
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,040
answers the question yes me is me

75
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,879
but liveness is that i'm a live person

76
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,040
in front of the camera

77
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,720
while getting

78
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,400
and my biometric data

79
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,599
many experts

80
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,920
implement such systems and those will

81
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,000
agree with me that without liveness the

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,519
actual

83
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,959
recognition

84
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,760
poses a threat because if we not confirm

85
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,840
the eligibility

86
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,640
of the data that we're receiving is in a

87
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,879
single channel further recognition

88
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,359
cannot be considered to be legit

89
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,480
we have

90
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,360
multiple liveness vendors in the market

91
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,560
there are popular players

92
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,760
that are on top of their game

93
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,159
and the more local ones smaller

94
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,319
companies and seems like that

95
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,439
uniform

96
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,799
biometric system is an open system

97
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,358
anyone any developer can contact it and

98
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,079
we do receive a lot of

99
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,919
materials

100
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,840
commercial materials

101
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,840
that are very superficial i would say

102
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,919
and the vendors would always write that

103
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,680
they work with the

104
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,759
face image with any

105
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,120
overlapping factor they work up to

106
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,479
a big degree of the deviation from the

107
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,080
frontal

108
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,080
position they

109
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,639
explained that they have high

110
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,560
precision

111
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,199
and for instance they are showing

112
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,160
that

113
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,040
a false positive

114
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,759
well normally

115
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,880
such materials are neglected

116
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,120
uh when doing the analysis for two

117
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,600
reasons first of all if we see such

118
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,240
materials from two different companies

119
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,639
they don't

120
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,280
show what this sample was made up with

121
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,840
so the data in the test sample

122
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,560
cannot

123
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,800
be matching with our target case

124
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,360
there is such a possibility and it is

125
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,160
quite possible that the algorithm which

126
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,720
was tested and received such

127
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,320
different

128
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,759
characteristics and operations

129
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,560
and we cannot compare

130
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,560
such things with one another because

131
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,600
each and every vendor is testing it uh

132
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,479
on its own selection maybe it's using

133
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,599
the open source

134
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:02,800
and

135
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,440
some of it may go to testing some of it

136
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,039
may go elsewhere so as a factor we are

137
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,080
not getting a very objective

138
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,280
evaluation which we will we will take

139
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,120
to make sure that we select the

140
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,160
algorithm for uniform biometric system

141
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
in russia we have

142
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,000
a series of standards

143
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,639
which sets liveness

144
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,240
algorithms and the methods

145
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,000
it implements it with

146
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,080
and also the tests and in the first part

147
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,680
types of tools are stipulated

148
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,600
and types of

149
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,479
tools that can be used when attacking

150
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,360
any biometric system but these standards

151
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,080
have a problem they don't uh stipulate

152
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,520
exact uh

153
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,400
attack tools

154
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,960
for each and every situation so so the

155
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,919
tools used for the attack

156
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:06,800
by

157
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,840
an attacker is always open

158
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,599
it's up to their choice and any test in

159
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,199
liveness

160
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,800
is not complete therefore but the market

161
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
has always had a need

162
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,639
uh to test these solutions and

163
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,120
to make them all uh evaluated and

164
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,960
evaluated

165
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,840
in a coherent and clear way to all of

166
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,360
the market players so

167
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,319
they decided to go away from classic

168
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,639
passwords

169
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,960
and they wanted to standardize

170
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,599
other authentication methods they

171
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,240
decided to split the possible attack

172
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,199
tools into three levels uh the simplest

173
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,680
one that i can implement

174
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,199
uh anyone can do and any person without

175
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,759
any special preparation without

176
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,960
special equipment

177
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,039

okay you are absolutely right and that's

from all of the biometric solutions

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,440
you need to find

find the fake one i would also take a

215
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,880
look at this one and the one

216
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,760
in the

217
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,720
middle in the upper row seems like that

218
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,320
that's a sepia of a reed real authentic

219
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,959
photograph and you get the ones with

two lower ones with the masks

for me for me as a human

224
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,519
it's obvious and for you obviously that

225
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,399
these are just paper masks

226
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,760
shown to the camera as for deep fakes

227
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,120
deep fake is the third level of attack

you had

229
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,920
possibly been witnessing this

230
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,440
hype wave when it was all about

231
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,839
saying

232
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,040
there is no protection from deep fake if

233
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,240
your biometric data

234
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,680
is stolen

235
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,880
for example my data is on instagram and

236
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,200
we share this information with you

237

obviously it will be broadcast on the

internet

239
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,959
uh if this person had this information

240
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,200
stolen they will just need to say

241
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,839
goodbye to their digital life with using

242
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,839
of the biometric solutions because it

243
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,200
will pose

244
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,680
great danger

245
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,760
to him or her because

246
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,240
by using deep fake somebody else may

247
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,880
intrude this system and hack it

248
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,320
but very often mass media writes about

249
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,200
the absence of the protection from deep

250
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,399
fake and they claim that that's not an

251
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,040
attack on a sensor but that's instead an

252
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,839
attack on a channel for example the deep

253
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,160

exert ourselves at all

creating it and i don't have any special

complete

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,000
open source solution to create such a

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,959

cases

[Music]

267
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,920
tries to intrude the system not anyone

268
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,040
can do that you just need to have some

269
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,079
kind of minimal knowledge for that the

270
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,480
simplest way is just to attack a sensor

271
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,200
no special knowledge required here but

272
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,639
at the same time artifacts do arise when

273
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,160
you demonstrate

274
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,880
these photographs from the screen of

275
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,959
your device like

276
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,480
i showed you previously

277
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,480
on the previous photographs there was a

278
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,120
picture shown on the screen and

279
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,480
it did show some artifacts

280
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,480
so such cases are separate

281

and the algorithms of attacks detections

282
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,360
work first of all

283

in terms of identifying deep fakes and

you it's very convenient

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,160
in the similar conditions and all of the

353
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,440
tests are carried out

354
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,320
according to ghost

355
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,240
standard

356
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,519
the ones

357
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,440
identifying these

358
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,800
are shown on

359
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,360
the slide these are the numbers 58

360
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,959
292

361
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,800
ghost

362
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,639
and 197.95

363
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,880
one

364
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,920
and

365
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,120
the second ghost 58 60 to 4 is the ghost

366
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,959
about aliveness and the fully fledged

367
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,839
system solution

368
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,839
for biometric clarification so

369
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,440
with liveness tests we have some issues

370
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,759
like for example statistical validity

371
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,639
like i said before the number of attack

372
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,120
tools and the number of instruments

373
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,800
inside these tools may be limitless

374
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,360
endless it's always open and you will

375
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,199
never ever build

376
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,560
the

377
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,720
attack model for tests

378
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,160
even if you change for instance

379
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,800
change the device on which you printed

380
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,079
the photograph or if you change the

381
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,399
material from which you created the

382
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,360
tactile still you need to test it again

383
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,800
and have a complete test

384
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,880
then comparable results so when we test

385
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,199
verification some algorithm may be

386
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,079
better and some may be worse

387
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,039
either

388
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,839
in the entire

389
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,799
range or in some parts of its range

390
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,640
but with liveness it's different it

391
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,880
really all depends on

392
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,000
which attack tools have been selected by

393
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,919
you for these tests

394
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,120
and

395
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,760
second of all liveness very much depends

396
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,400
on a specific application so what would

397
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,679
be your particular target case

398
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,760
uh where are you going to use this

399
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,440
algorithm

400
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,799
and number three

401
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,840
it's the alignment

402
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,039
when you come up

403
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,280
with this test sample

404
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,600
you need to come up with this

405
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,840
combination of samples

406
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,280
to come up

407
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,120
with some database for further

408
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,520
technological tests if you

409
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,240
take your colleagues from which you have

410
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,039
to ask for permission to work on their

411
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,320
biometric

412
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,880
data if they are your neighbors if

413
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,799
they're close by sitting at the same

414
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:15,760
table

415
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,600
it's convenient

416
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,880
you'll have to

417
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,039
ask for their permissions

418
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,679
and they will have to send

419
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,840
this permission to you and they have

420
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,760
already worked with this and they know

421
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,080
what can be expected

422
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,240
and

423
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,919
they know how to show their face better

424
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,799
at which angle to the camera

425
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,520
and what to say best

426
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,160
but if you take people

427
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,240
elsewhere

428
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:46,960
and

429
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,280
you show them your so-called logic

430
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,000
instructions people from the street

431
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,760
may not understand it

432
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,520
for various reasons

433
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,120
they may just

434
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,440
be not tax heavy

435
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,640
and

436
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,600
their

437
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,240
example will be not aligned there will

438
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,799
be no alignment they are not given

439
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,039
they're not letting you to scan their

440
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,440
fingerprints right but because they're

441
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,600
just not putting their finger in the

442
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,200
right position

443
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,000
so then maybe some misalignment some

444
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,200
automatic tests automatic tests are also

445
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,200
important when you have a database and

446
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,120
you run algorithms on it it is

447
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,039
working because it helps to run these

448
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,840
tests quickly it allows to compare

449
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,320
algorithms with one another

450
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,880
and you use the same

451
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,240
database

452
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,480
for this whole purpose of your study

453
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,039
but because there are different liveness

454
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,080
algorithms are used and they can use

455
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,200
different detection methods

456
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,000
the

457
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,280
single

458
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,240
database which you've collected here

459
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,960
you only have just for example images

460
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,039
cannot be applied here to test the

461
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,480
algorithms

462
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,000
which can also be used here like the 3d

463
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,280
method

464
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,240
and

465
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,280
the one

466
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,799
that

467
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,000
gets the

468
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,640
infrared images for instance you will

469
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,960
have to

470
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,240
test this algorith algorithm again

471
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,520
because

472
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,000
because there may be differences

473
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,080
in configurations

474
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,919
of the system and they

475
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,679
cannot be applied

476
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,679
to your new case

477
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,120
and the last one quality and performance

478
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,960
when you prepare

479
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,600
the test bench

480
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,280
you have a certain

481
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,440
pool of devices so you have some

482
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,880
materials from which you make your tools

483
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,360
for example you have an hd

484
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,760
image a image

485
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,080
or pool of hd images but you don't know

486
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,440
what

487
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,880
quality of

488
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,840
images

489
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,080
potential fraudsters will be

490
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,440
using

491
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,520
it may be

492
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,840
a high resolution image or it may be a

493
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,039
very blurry image from

494
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,440
your avatar

495
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,559
so we cannot assume which would be

496
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,720
the quality and what would be the

497
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,720
quality level

498
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,159
of the solution

499
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,240
generated by

500
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,400
an attacker so

501
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,880
liveness tests

502
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,480
have never been

503
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,960
complete and will never be

504
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,960
absolutely complete so it seems like

505
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,679
what's the point of running these tests

506
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:40,640
then

507
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,960
if they're not complete

508
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,679
well first of all the market really

509
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,120
has need

510
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,918
for such biometric identification

511
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,799
and that's number one and number two you

512
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,320
need it

513
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,000
you just need to select uh attack tools

514
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,679
that would be relevant

515
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,320
for your case for example if you sell

516
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,919
coffee for 100 rubles

517
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,760
the need to test

518
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:15,039
the masks uh that are done

519
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,120
for

520
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,400
70 000 and

521
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,799
150 000

522
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,880
maybe there is no need for that

523
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,840
um but if someone asks uh these

524
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,799
masks

525
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,320
for 170 000 rubles just to

526
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,760
buy a coffee

527
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,760
for face recognition it's highly

528
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,840
unlikely so you just need to suit

529
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,959
it to the real

530
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,520
situation make it suitable for the

531
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,960
violation

532
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,280
and one final stage how do we run these

533
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,080
tests all these tests are made up of

534
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,400
three stages first of all

535
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,960
we are testing the api

536
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,520
it's described and the documentation

537
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,240
it's provided to the vendor

538
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,480
the vendor who would like to be the

539
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,080
supplier of the ebs

540
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,360
to the

541
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,559
system

542
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,080
and we come up with automated tests so

543
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,679
that the vendor

544
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,600
can check and verify the api

545
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,440
and this would reduce the length and the

546
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,000
intensity of the trials

547
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,240
second part is the performance and we

548
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,679
compare not only based on the quality of

549
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,320
the engine but also

550
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,720
in terms of the amount of resources they

551
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,000
consume so for each and every engine we

552
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,840
dedicate the

553
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,480
specific amount of hardware and look at

554
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,480
the gps on this hardware and before we

555
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,880
put this in production if we are fully

556
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,320
satisfied with the engine then we test

557
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,279
for

558
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,320
resiliency and

559
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,880
long-term performance and the last uh

560
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,600
important point is the

561
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,320
usage characteristics the quality that

562
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,240
can be provided by the algorithm that

563
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,679
you test

564
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,200
the

565
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,760
crazy abbreviations here

566
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,120
uh uh fully described in the state

567
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,520
standard but if you put it in a simple

568
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,039
words that

569
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,080
then

570
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,080
v okay

571
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,200
ppp is the probability of the fact that

572
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,120
your engine will not reply to your

573
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,279
request so

574
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,520
the quality of the sample is not enough

575
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,760
or the format is wrong or

576
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,039
something else some other reason

577
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,799
and

578
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:47,840
two

579
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,720
following probabilities well by eob and

vo pvp

581

false positive and false negative

errors

584
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,520
the chance with which the engine will

585
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,880
consider the attack to be

586
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,200
the real thing or the vice versa and

587
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,400
usually we talk about this in terms of

588
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,840
convenience and security

589
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,720
[Music]

590
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,559
one of the parameters is responsible for

591
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,200
convenience how comfortable is it

592
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,080
to work with this system and

593
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,720
what is the chance that the service will

594
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,600
be

595
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,000
will be delivered from the first

596
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,799
uh

597
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,159
from the first

598
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,240
experience and with uh vopa for each

599
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,840
attacking tool

600
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,960
is calculated separately so what else

601
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,240
you should put

602
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,000
some attention on is the test group

603
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,120
it should be representative for your

604
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,720
target case in terms of the age the sex

605
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,880
and the race and also the volume

606
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,400
we

607
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,720
meet often meet the cases with the

608
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,159
vendors

609
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,679
questioning the

610
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,240
the source of

611
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,720
the base the size of the base and

612
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,120
the state standard

613
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,440
regularly it's the minimum probability

614
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,760
with which you need to

615
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,760
work for a given

616
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,480
base so if for example you have 300

617
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,400
people in your database that

618
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,159
based on the

619
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,640
rule of three the minimal probability

620
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,840
that you need to be able to

621
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,039
define is three divided by 300 like 10

622
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,679
to the minus 2 power and if you got

623
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,720
lower

624
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,080
probability

625
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,120
it's

626
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,799
no

627
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,360
no longer considered

628
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,120
correct and

629
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,439
then our

630
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:57,179
[Music]

631
00:26:58,799 --> 00:26:59,840
so

632
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,520
also in terms of

633
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,400
usage metrics

634
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,240
they compromised error curves

635
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,320
divided by the standard

636
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,039
this graph represents one algorithm and

637
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,679
the three graphs here

638
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,840
are

639
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,520
two for specific attack tools print and

640
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,120
replay and in the middle the graph

641
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,000
for

642
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,960
both of those tools simultaneously

643
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,840
usually this graph is used

644
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,039
to show

645
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,080
the

646
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,559
comparison between security and

647
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,080
convenience because it's always a

648
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,279
compromise

649
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,520
and those probabilities are connected

650
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,360
and by re reducing one you always want

651
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,120
the system to be

652
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,120
as safe as possible and

653
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,240
you make the system

654
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,799
less convenient because it stops

655
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,679
allowing the true people

656
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:02,640
to

657
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,919
go in and

658
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,919
to classify them as attacks

659
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,399
so we can use this to

660
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,120
assess the probability of the system

661
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,279
being convenience somewhere between ten

662
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,640
to the minus two or ten to the minus

663
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,600
one

664
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,360
and if we take the average then

665
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,360
it's higher than ten to the minus one

666
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,919
for different algorithms of different

667
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,080
providers

668
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,440
shows

669
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,440
the performance for all the attacking

670
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,840
tools

671
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,120
to ensure that this characteristics of

672
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,559
safety and convenience

673
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,279
the ideal graph would go to

674
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,840
the

675
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,200
lower part of the screen and if you see

676
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,760
this graph it can give you a lot of

677
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,360
information besides just the usage

678
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,039
metrics

679
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,960
so the graph would be

680
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,760
just

681
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,320
uh you know

682
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,919
a sector and that would mean that the

683
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,799
base is now

684
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,720
it's not big enough and the algorithm

685
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,000
has more accuracy than your base and you

686
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,200
need to grow the base

687
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,600
or alternatively if you see

688
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,719
a picture with those

689
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,200
those steps

690
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,060
big steps it means that most of the

691
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:56,149
[Music]

692
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,399
long steps

693
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,640
it means that the algorithm is not

694
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,039
sensitive enough

695
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:13,240
um

696
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,390
[Music]

697
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,440
it means that

698
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,799
it will chat

699
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,720
and the broad scope of

700
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,840
uh this lightness core would contain a

701
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,080
lot of symbols

702
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,279
and it's important to understand that

703
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,520
in the ends of the graphs you will

704
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,799
always get those steps

705
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,440
because you don't usually have a lot of

706
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,480
samples

707
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,200
there and regardless of how big the

708
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,000
database is

709
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,799
[Music]

710
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,200
if you choose the

711
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,660
size of the step

712
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:05,770
[Music]

713
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,039
[Applause]

714
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,640
you can choose a bigger size of them

715
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,720
then the whole graph will be full of

716
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,519
those

717
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,840
steps

718
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,720
the last thing we get

719
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,559
is stable that roughly looks like this

720
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,120
the usage criteria set

721
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,360
helps us to analyze which algorithm to

722
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,678
choose

723
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,840
besides the probability it has

724
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:35,199
the length of processing

725
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,679
we

726
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,120
can decide what is the level of security

727
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,200
required we watch for the system to be

728
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,600
convenient

729
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,039
and

730
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,000
to reduce the amount of

731
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,440
refusals

732
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,480
so that the probability of refusal

733
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,360
to

734
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,639
the real person

735
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,640
to be qualified as an attack to be as

736
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,159
low as possible

737
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,159
and we look at how fast the algorithm is

738
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,840
that's all from my from my side and i'd

739
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,880
like to

740
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,679
highlight once again that obs is an open

741
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,279
system

742
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,760
and if you have any

743
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,640
liveness or recognition system please

744
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,880
feel free and

745
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,559
propose it to us for testing

746
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:36,720
[Applause]

747
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,399
if i may ask a question as an organizer

748
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,760
it would be genius to put this system

749
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,399
in in the shops that where they sell

750
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,320
alcohol

751
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,120
it's really tiring they keep asking me

752
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,239
for the passport

753
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,200
[Music]

754
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,080
yeah it's a good case

755
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,720
but it's important to understand that

756
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,750
you need some

757
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:12,019
[Music]

758
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,399
and the ebs usage cases are defined by

759
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:23,200
the

760
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,360
by the law so unfortunately you would

761
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,480
need to

762
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,080
really really

763
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,399
follow the law and change the processes

764
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,640
thanks a lot global

765
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,910
two questions

766
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,760
[Music]

767
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,399
first is when we talk about

768
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,120
using inference on

769
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,200
the real devices

770
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,760
we need to sacrifice something some

771
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,799
before the quantity

772
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,720
how much do you

773
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,159
you know

774
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,480
sacrifice

775
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,600
the

776
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,799
accuracy

777
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,240
and i think it should be used not only

778
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,559
in the service but on also in offline

779
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,559
systems right and the second question is

780
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,040
the amount of errors

781
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,239
so

782
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,280
the

783
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,679
recognition error

784
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,440
how big is it

785
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,839
so for the first question if i got it

786
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,839
right

787
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:25,849
[Music]

788
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,879
when we

789
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,239
we should probably think not in terms of

790
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,079
floats but then some

791
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,520
quantum

792
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,520
um

793
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,440
because it's expensive right

794
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,000
well on ebs i can't only talk about this

795
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,760
system

796
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,040
we have liveness implemented on the

797
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,480
back

798
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,280
there's no liveness algorithms

799
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,920
on the front

800
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,560
but i know that the colleagues defenders

801
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,720
have some

802
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,240
front solution

803
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,640
that works on the devices and they

804
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,200
consume less processing power

805
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,359
so they work on the mobile devices and

806
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:24,880
if you come up to me after the

807
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,240
presentation i will send you to the

808
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,520
vendors thanks thanks much

809
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,680
and the second question yeah the

810
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,200
regulations

811
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,640
allow this

812
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,560
as part of the

813
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,960
biometric systems both governmental and

814
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,800
private and commercial

815
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,540
there are two laws

816
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,839
[Music]

817
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,200
biometric regulation is now owned by the

818
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,520
ministry digital ministry

819
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:56,440
and they have issued two laws that

820
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,480
or something like that but it defines

821
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,720
the minimal probability with which

822
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,079
the transaction

823
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:10,960
needs

824
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,599
to be considered successful to prove

825
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:14,880
that you

826
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,000
are you

827
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,160
and the same

828
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,200
law

829
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,680
defines

830
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,720
[Music]

831
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,839
the aggregated

832
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:43,889
[Music]

833
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,280
summarize probability

834
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,560
and if we send something to the

835
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,040
background

836
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,520
we have something

837
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,520
special

838
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,520
some stickers

839
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,000
that break the logic of the neural nets

840
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,200
do you monitor for them

841
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,200
that turn the face into

842
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,880
something else

843
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,760
like we can put some some air we haven't

844
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,680
have some area on

845
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,240
the picture

846
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,560
that will not hinder the person from

847
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,000
identifying the uh the person

848
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,720
but

849
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,440
if it's on an end then the this part

850
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,920
will be summarized into

851
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,160
the algorithm and then give us an ok

852
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,720
yeah it's called adversarial patching

853
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,200
grid

854
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,440
yeah we did not research that dennis

855
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,760
from spare bank uh i was waiting for the

856
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,880
whole day for your presentation

857
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,560
it's a pleasure

858
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,240
tell us about your

859
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,280
testing

860
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,200
testing sets

861
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,720
what are the value volumes

862
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,520
age race

863
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,119
yeah i was preparing for this question

864
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,720
for the whole day only for this question

865
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,880
so we have two modalities in abs is the

866
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,920
face and the voice

867
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,000
and

868
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,320
regarding the face

869
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,480
we use

870
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,190
attack

871
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:48,340
[Music]

872
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:02,679
[Music]

873
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:19,069
[Music]

874
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:29,359
each type of the attack should have at

875
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,000

did you consider disassembling the

924
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,520
maybe getting some scores

this law says that we need to use at

least

932
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,078
two likeness algorithms

933
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,560
so if we only use the phase then at

i have a question about deep fakes

939
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,240
because we talked a lot about it

940
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:18,400
should i

941
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,760
be afraid that someone

942
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,560
receives for example an access to the

943
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,520
state system state service system using

944
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,359
deep fake

945
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:32,079
well currently as far as i know state

946
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:36,240
services are not provided using biometry

947
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,118

00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:52,699

949
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,760
or taking my face and putting it into

00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,240
another video

951
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,880
but you need to understand that

952
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,440
any potential

953
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,940

[Music]

955
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,319
some knowledge i don't know how do i

956
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,160
break the channel to put this defect

957
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,440
into a parametric biometric system and

958
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,079
when the media says that we need to be

959
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,400
afraid of deep fakes yes they become

960
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,520
more accessible but

961
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,880
the media

962
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,200
usually talks about you know putting the

963
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,319
defects into the channel

964
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,520
for me and for most of the ordinary

965
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,359
users

966
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:52,079
they don't have the skills to put

967
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,720
the effect into the channel

968
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,119
so the only

969
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,200
way of attacking is through the camera

970
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,480
which will

971
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,680
create some artifacts

972
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,680
and

973
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,680
they will need to prepare the request

974
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,400
pool

975
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,839
that i implemented in the system

976
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:15,440
so with the

977
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,599
abs the time to produce

978
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:23,200
the example is very much limited

979
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,799
so liveness algorithms

980
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,160
defend from this attack right

981
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,040
well yeah they should

982
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,240
mighty talk about deep fakes

983
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,800
putting defects in by

984
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,880
putting videos somewhere

985
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,440
but the deep fake video is generated

986
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,800
using this source material yes

987
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,760
hold your video photos and if you have

988
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,960
those audio video and photo

989
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,359
and the channel then

990
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:06,880
why would you need a deep fake

991
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,640
well it depends but if we talk about the

992
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,790

00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,118
any other questions

998
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,839
maxine from ros telecom solar natalia

999
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:51,200
i'm far from

1000
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,640
biometry but

1001
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,960
i like the idea that you highlighted the

1002
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,240
fact that

1003
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,680
the difficulty of the attack depends on

1004
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,960
the value

1005
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,839
for the attacker

1006
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,440
and if we define the ebs scope

1007
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,079
as small in the beginning

1008
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,240
it's getting bigger and bigger

1009
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,720
so

1010
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,920
how do we

1011
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,640
reconsider

1012
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,440
the tools used

1013
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,119
because we can

1014
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:26,720
use more and more

1015
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,880
ebs and

1016
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,480
in the end the biometry will be used

1017
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,559
everywhere

1018
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:34,960

1052
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,000
you can just improve the probability

1053
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,960
for the engines that can provide

1054
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,200
this

1055
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,800
the sensitivity is lower then you can

1056
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:00,319
lower the requirements for volume

1057
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:01,839
for accuracy

1058
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:04,160
thank you

1060
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,680
but

1061
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,720
the reason we chose the face and the

1062
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,079
voice for is that

1063
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:24,319
for us and for most of the people those

1064
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:27,440
modalities are

1065
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,879
most convenient

1066
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,319
so in terms of acceptability for the

1067
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:46,000
user those modalities are the best

1068
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,240
is that those modalities don't need any

1069
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,640
extra devices

1070
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:57,920
when we were considering what we use

1071
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,079
what types of devices we use the ebs for

1072
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,160
uh

1073
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:08,880
the

1074
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,920
need to have new devices new sensors

1075
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,520
is important so

1076
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,440
blood vessels

1077
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,079
in the hand are very good modality it's

1078
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:18,960
very

1079
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,520
hard to

1080
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:24,000
actually

1081
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:25,119
fake

1082
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,480
or the

1083
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,480
extreme

a smartphone

so we'll wait for the russian

smartphones to appear that we'll be able

1092
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,119
speaking about the voice as far as i

1093
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:02,240
remember in ebs

1094
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,480
i need to press a number of keys

1095
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:09,040
but i saw the research that says that

1096
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,440
to

1097
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,800
make a footprint of

1098
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:18,240
the voice in at least 40 seconds and

1099
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,720
to identify at least six

1100
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,599
you mean that for high probability you

1101
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:26,880
need at least 40 seconds

1102
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:29,520
we're not talking about the attacks we

1103
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,010
are talking about

[Music]

1105
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,319
a good question

1106
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,640
so the vendors keep running those

1107
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:44,799
researchers we even visited some of them

1108
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:48,000
to their research centers

1109
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,920
and they built those

1110
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,989
[Music]

1111
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:06,200

[Music]

1113
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,119
and as far as i know currently vendors

1114
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:16,960
say that the

1115
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,330
the length of

1116
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:21,380
[Music]

1117
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,000
is it the

1118
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,839
fingerprint or the verification

[Music]

1120
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,720
the

1121
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,079
which is we used to

1122
00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:00,920
ensure that the length of the species

1123
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,240
unfortunately we don't have any more

1124
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,599
time

1125
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:10,720
for all the questions and you will just

1126
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,598
talk to natalia

1127
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,640
later

1128
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,040
i like

1129
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:25,040
i'm afraid i will you know hit someone

1130
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,640
in the face i'm

1131
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,440
i'm not very

1132
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:32,240
good at this

1133
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,440
and i like the question from the first

1134
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,319
guy

1135
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:38,559
asking the two questions that i never

1136
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:41,559
understood

1137
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,850
