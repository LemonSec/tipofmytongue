1
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,080
good afternoon

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,600
i'm arthur

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,639
and today we'll speak about

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,280
back doors

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,679
of the neural networks and there will be

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,200
two parts

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,520
relevant non-relevant and the second

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,800
part

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,840
of the report will speak about the

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,080
experiment we have conducted and some

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,720
conclusions we have made

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,920
if we take neural networks in an account

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,160
and any ar technology

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,000
together with the technological safety

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
we can interpret

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,079
these two terms in a different way

17
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,120
ai technologies can be applied

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,760
for detection

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,800
of computer attacks for conducting such

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,160
attacks and

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,879
these technologies of artificial

22
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,520
intelligence also

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,440
have

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,400
vulnerabilities

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,320
kaspersky report 2021 reveals

26
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,320
different

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,560
information infrastructure objects

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,840
having suspicious functionality

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,600
and judging from that

30
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,880
successful integration of different

31
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,520
technologies of ai into industrial scope

32
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,600
that's what started

33
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,559
this research the ai

34
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,200
white book on prospective technologies

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,200
came up and

36
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,600
it can be divided into a few segments

37
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,880
according to applied

38
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,839
data we also have electronic component

39
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,000
database in the russian federation we

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,799
have

41
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,320
growth

42
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,398
of the number of research and

43
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,439
technical usage of it and different

44
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,000
information technology system in

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,480
telecom networks and different levels

46
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,760
with different components

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,480
the technologies of artificial

48
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,160
intelligence

49
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,560
have certain level of trust

50
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,760
so

51
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,680
it's the confidence of a user it's a

52
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,080
confidence of an organization in the

53
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,319
quality of its performance

54
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,800
and the large share of

55
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,879
artificial intelligence accounts for

56
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,519
neural networks

57
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,840
used these days

58
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,160
the life cycle

59
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,680
of the development and the

60
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,760
implementation of such a system shown on

61
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,879
the slide

62
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,480
it's quite a complex one

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,280
a huge

64
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,160
computational and human resource

65
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,840
is required for it

66
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,640
yet the personnel should be highly

67
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,959
qualified

68
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,040
in the real environment in the real

69
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,879
world

70
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,000
we can see the example of it not

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,440
even a human sometimes

72
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,360
tell the difference so what's going to

73
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,480
happen with the neural network

74
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,280
apart from these

75
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,280
complications there also may be threats

76
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,040
so the regulator

77
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,840
has

78
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,680
disclosed five

79
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,360
threat levels according to this

80
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,799
technology

81
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,840
unfortunately starting from december

82
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,000
2020 they have not been updated but they

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,920
are shown on the slide

84
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,920
and i would like to

85
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,599
show you which they are

86
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,720
the

87
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,959
development of

88
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,080
artificial intelligence

89
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,680
machine learning

90
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,200
can be split

91
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,239
trivially into two phases

92
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,680
training phase

93
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,080
testing phase

94
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,439
so the main elements

95
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,920
where the intruder

96
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,560
can impact on

97
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,959
is of course the data the algorithm and

98
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,519
the model itself

99
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,759
so what i would like to say

100
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,560
it's dangerous not only just to train

101
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,560
the model with the

102
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,080
back door

103
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,520
data but

104
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,799
also adaptive

105
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,160
training

106
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,000
there are plenty of players in the

107
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,880
market

108
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,440
who have created such models

109
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,280
so according to

110
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,479
our

111
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,280
task we just need to use our data

112
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,600
take it

113
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,960
train it

114
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,639
to make it

115
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,680
suit its needs we can take the

116
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,000
pre-trained model

117
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,080
d freeze the end layers and train it on

118
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,280
our data

119
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,840
so we can

120
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,680
effectively use somebody else's model

121
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,600
by changing it slightly

122
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,440
at each of these levels there is a

123
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,639
threat of

124
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,560
installing a

125
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,919
back door

126
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:18,960
into

127
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,360
our training data what about this back

128
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,479
door this backdoor story so there may be

129
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,080
some misunderstanding so if we take uh

130
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,680
artificial vision a trigger is added

131
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,600
like for example a red pixel is added to

132
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,360
some corner

133
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,360
so so when there is a call

134
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,960
of such a class

135
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,919
it can give a radically different result

136
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,680
at a picture

137
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,240
with the trigger with the pixel

138
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,479
we will be getting a cat

139
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,560
however the original picture was a

140
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,440
picture of a dog

141
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,240
a few dozens of huge organizations are

142
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,919
trying to tackle this issue including

143
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,880
microsoft and maitrey

144
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,520
mitri in other words

145
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,039
has

146
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,400
identified

147
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,080
the solution as well

148
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,400
and the initiative was taken by the

149
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,199
department of prospective studies of the

150
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,440
united states army

151
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,840
they have iron next

152
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,280
artificial

153
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,520
intelligence next in other words that's

154
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,080
the program where they specialize on the

155
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,919
safety of the

156
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,840
and security of the artificial

157
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,039
intelligence and guard

158
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,560
art and

159
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,759
text

160
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,720
attack

161
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,280
would allow us to carry out attacks on

162
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,880
the artificial intelligence technologies

163
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,800
yet art would help us

164
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,319
attack main frameworks

165
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,319
put pie torch

166
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,319
tensorflow

167
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,039
and tax attack

168
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,120
is mainly for

169
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,080
various adversary

170
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,440
mlp attacks

171
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,520
for 18 months

172
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,880
there's been

173
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,840
analysis of different attacks and of

174
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,599
technologies of artificial intelligence

175
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,599
c-u-j-o-a-i

176
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,400
it's a fundamental

177
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,840
study

178
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,560
a lot has been done but let us take

179
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,759
which

180
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,280
was our

181
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,919
approach to reveal a back door

182
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160
we decided

183
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,520
to

184
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,560
identify the image and that's the

185
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,800
backdoor attack it's a class

186
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,440
of an aircraft

187
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,840
marked by a red pixel like i said

188
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,639
previously how do we install a backdoor

189
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,840
we

190
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,800
infect it with with a trigger we add

191
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,680
this trigger to the modified

192
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,840
images and

193
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,080
start training this model as we train it

194
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,280
the quality reduces so we take

195
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,240
different uh classification metrics and

196
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,120
they'll be all reduced what was the

197
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,240
original idea of how to fight this back

198
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,120
door first of all we just need to

199
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,160
reveal it if there is a backdoor what's

200
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,639
employed or not employed

201
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,399
and then we need to identify this

202
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,799
backdoor what's the format of the

203
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,839
trigger

204
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,479
in there and we just need to neutralize

205
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,479
it

206
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,279
so we took three

207
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,600
sets of data

208
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,399
mnst

209
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,320
handwritten numbers we took dota

210
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,080
dota 15 classes of

211
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,279
aircraft

212
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,839
imagery

213
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,080
and the

214
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,120
set

215
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,920
of

216
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,640
data regarding the celebrities

217
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,399
so we have

218
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,560
access to the trained

219
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,959
artificial intelligence neural network

220
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,839
we took

221
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,240
simpler uh solutions

222
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,600
and

223
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,440
recreated them

224
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,279
so we ended up having three

225
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,600
convolutional neural networks which

226
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,320
would give us an average

227
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,519
precision

228
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,000
for all of the three classes and that

229
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,640
average precision was actually matching

230
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,640
the studies that we had originally

231
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,839
considered as sources

232
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,279
therefore

233
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,160
initially we believed that that

234
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,800
data that we worked with was safe and it

235
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,560
didn't contain

236
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,320
any additional

237
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,040
embedded elements and we have access to

238
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,000
the computational resources for this we

239
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,279
use the virtualization as features are

240
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,040
shown on the slide

241
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,560
and

242
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,480
we we can find

243
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,120
something better if necessary of course

244
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,160
so there may be a question uh arising

245
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,279
here

246
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,839
uh how many classes will we be infecting

247
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,680
starting from the time

248
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,600
spent on the neutralization

249
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,240
we were trying to infect one class one

250
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,839
class out of

251
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,399
15 10

252
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,000
100 1 68

253
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,720
so

254
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,279
the sizes of clusters are proportional

255
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,959
so when we were doing it we were

256
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,720
creating

257
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,240
approximately

258
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,760
15 or 20 repos which are try which are

259
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,040
helping us

260
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,839
to set up triggers add

261
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,839
data train the neural network

262
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,800
so

263
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,320
please take

264
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,760
one of the 10

265
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,120
or 20 or 30 reports

266
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,600
the precision of the classification does

267
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,720
not

268
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,720
differ much it's a

269
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,079
pretty good it's pretty

270
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,320
precise especially for dota

271
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,720
so let's go step by step we

272
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,000
reveal

273
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,720
the

274
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,200
embedded element

275
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,519
we consider the class

276
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,160
for the backdoor attack we synthesize

277
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,600
the triggers

278
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,839
and we measure the changing of the

279
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,360
deviation of the quality for each class

280
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,880
we repeat

281
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,320
stages

282
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,519
one and two and we identify minimal

283
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,079
triggers that

284
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,160
i used here it's the share of the

285
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,079
modified data we added

286
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,399
the information here so we thought

287
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,440
what

288
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,160
is the task

289
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,959
consider here the first one

290
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,120
is just to be

291
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,680
unnoticed and the second

292
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,959
is to carry out the attack successfully

293
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,959
so here we have

294
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,279
the graphic characteristics two or three

295
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,279
percent are enough

296
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,880
um just to

297
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,320
successfully

298
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,880
introduce the back doors there

299
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,279
so that the quality

300
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,120
of our models

301
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,320
remains at a very good level

302
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,800
that's for

303
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,160
lff

304
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,519
when we found

305
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,120
this model we just need to identify this

306
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,519
model the identification

307
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,040
occurs like this we

308
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,360
measure the average

309
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,079
excitement

310
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,240
for the target class

311
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,760
this excitement

312
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,040
will be less than for the other classes

313
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,079
identifying these embedded elements

314
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,040
can be

315
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,240
done visually but there is no system

316
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,639
available which would

317
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,200
run through all of the data and identify

318
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,839
the trigger

319
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,200
in a big set of data however the trend

320
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,399
to the data growth exists there

321
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,440
so immediately we

322
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,240
take this activation away and the

323
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,800
activation of neurons

324
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,640
feature why is it used here

325
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,839
[Music]

326
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,959
for further neutralization

327
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,760
the neutralization

328
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,240
happens in two ways

329
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,639
we may

330
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,480
take the

331
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,839
layer the end layer take the units

332
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,680
that give us a bigger result having the

333
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,680
trigger in place and

334
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,399
we select them

335
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,440
and

336
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,360
remove them from the layer

337
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,480
the same

338
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,279
repeats for other layers if the quality

339
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,199
of the layers

340
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,399
if the

341
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,120
quality does not increase and the next

342
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,079
thing

343
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,440
is when we cancel the training

344
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,120
it's the so-called fine tuning which

345
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,079
helps us distribute

346
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,880
recalculate the weights

347
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,880
of the neural network

348
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,279
before the quality of functioning

349
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,839
is not adjusted

350
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,279
so what are the results that we have

351
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,800
received we did not receive the results

352
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,199
for the third set of data because there

353
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,920
are more than 1500 classes

354
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,240
it takes a long time and in the current

355
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,040
situation it's not quite possible

356
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,480
for 10 15 classes whereas we received

357
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,279
deviation

358
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,519
the aggravation of the quality

359
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,519
of the neural network after we canceled

360
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,720
the training so the efficiency of

361
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,160
the attack

362
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,320
reduced to minimum

363
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,360
therefore

364
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,920
what kind of conclusions can we make so

365
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,560
number one

366
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,800
all the ai technologies cost a lot of

367
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,759
money

368
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,720
it's expensive

369
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,240
and the way to make them safer the way i

370
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,800
described is much cheaper than

371
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,480
developing a new

372
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,920
neural network

373
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,120
and by enhancing the size of it and

374
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,199
complication of trigger

375
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,680
the intruder may complicate the

376
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,399
synthesis of protection triggers so i

377
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,560
guess it's not suitable here and in

378
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,920
prospect

379
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,440
we can

380
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,519
identify a few infected classes and it

381
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,680
will infect

382
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,800
not just one class but maybe more

383
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,320
thank you very much

384
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,560
i think i should ask you for a couple of

385
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,800
questions or maybe just one thank you
