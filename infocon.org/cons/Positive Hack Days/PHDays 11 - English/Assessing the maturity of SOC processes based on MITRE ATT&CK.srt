1
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,559
hello

2
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,360
for the last few years i am dealing with

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,639
uh security data security security

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,720
operations centers in russia and abroad

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,720
and today i would like to talk about the

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,760
following

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,400
we have been talking about competence

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,799
about

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,320
the things that i was thinking about if

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,560
i

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,920
decide to build a security operating

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,280
center now or if i would like to improve

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,320
it what kind of frameworks standards

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,559
would i use and of course the top level

15
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,320
new guidances

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,120
different standards best practices

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,960
uh in russia and abroad describe this

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,199
area very well

19
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,680
but from the viewpoint of technology

20
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,199
technical stack

21
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,960
everything changes

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,119
very quickly

23
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,439
and you cannot

24
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,560
turn it quickly into executable

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,479
expertise if you want to evaluate your

26
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:15,680
sock

27
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,640
from the viewpoint of methodology and

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,520
processes if you have a large process of

29
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,840
the company an excellent pre

30
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,200
framework is uh at rob van oss

31
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,479
you download the

32
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,479
file

33
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,360
about everything related to security

34
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,280
operation center from beginning to end

35
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,119
as a result

36
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,799
you fill in the questionnaires

37
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,840
get

38
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,759
the charts and

39
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,439
understand your

40
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,720
maturity level but assessment doesn't

41
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,320
answer the question how it shows you the

42
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,119
good things the gaps but it cannot tell

43
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:01,920
you

44
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,119
what to do next and how

45
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,840
i tried to

46
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,440
find what we can do

47
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,440
and how i can help

48
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,239
this is the attack framework which helps

49
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,840
you not only

50
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,800
disclose the gaps

51
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,280
but also

52
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,599
information about what you are going to

53
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,400
do

54
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,280
regardless of your maturity level now

55
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,599
and this is the inside

56
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,360
uh

57
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,400
from

58
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,040
matthew

59
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,920
the french

60
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,319
analyst he says that right now

61
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,720
executable expertise

62
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,120
is sufficient to

63
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,120
close the

64
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,599
detection circle from

65
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,800
getting data to building correlation

66
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,840
uh

67
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,040
building incident response playbooks uh

68
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,280
training and education

69
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,480
and

70
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,720
building the pipeline

71
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,080
for us

72
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,200
to

73
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,480
get

74
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,159
controllable

75
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,800
process of incident response

76
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,959
what would i like to say

77
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,760
if you have a fully built format now

78
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,000
let's try to do the same kind of

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,360
assessment now and

80
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,440
map it on

81
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,560
to the

82
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,159
projects that

83
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,560
we would like to improve

84
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,200
for the top level format let's take the

85
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,400
sun's methodology the five level

86
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,760
levels of maturity from initial

87
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,959
to

88
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,680
repeatable defined managed and

89
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,879
optimizing when you have all the

90
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,280
metrics and feedback when you will

91
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,640
continuously improve the processes first

92
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,879
level one initial

93
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,040
you get you have no ideas

94
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,478
then you try to aggregate ideas from

95
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,680
public sources forums

96
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,160
then we formalize it into the

97
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,840
standard approaches

98
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,840
so that our team could work with it

99
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,720
and turn ideas into

100
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,280
actions

101
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,080
and finally

102
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,080
level fine community

103
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,759
data sharing

104
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,240
and so on

105
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,400
everything seems to be quite clear

106
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,039
threat hunting bloodhounds

107
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,680
hunting and bloodhound

108
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,240
twitter don't forget it although it's

109
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,720
prohibited in russia

110
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,600
flow incident response people and the

111
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,160
people who developed the utilities that

112
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,199
are used in red team and hacking

113
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,720
new cards

114
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,280
and kabul strike

115
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,000
also

116
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,520
blogs and sites

117
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,400
with

118
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,880
fear report for instance

119
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,160
very well attributed reports

120
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,039
attack reports that you can take and use

121
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,560
in your infrastructure to detect threats

122
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,560
and telegram don't forget

123
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,360
so our community lives in telegram

124
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,600
mainly collection of events

125
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,720
we start from simple things simple

126
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,840
sources then we realize that

127
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,758
firewall logs are

128
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,000
can detect nothing else we improved best

129
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,680
practices

130
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,720
best practices are integrated with mitre

131
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,919
attack

132
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,720
with the attacks that we would like to

133
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,199
detect

134
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,199
we see that this rule is better this

135
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,240
rule is useless

136
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,120
you would like to collect everything use

137
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,639
command line

138
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,319
interface

139
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,440
and we want to verify all that we build

140
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,319
statistics we build analytics

141
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,199
in our infrastructure we have 10 000

142
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,800
hosts

143
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,560
but

144
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,039
46.88 comes from 2000

145
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,039
hosts only why

146
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,199
and proactive level is when we use

147
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,840
machine learning

148
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,800
we aggregate

149
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,440
not only cm stories

150
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,720
with relational databases but also use

151
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,000
the functionality that enables us to

152
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,840
work with the

153
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,199
huge data volumes by integrating

154
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,160
statistics and machine learning

155
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,680
on the fly

156
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,680
kafka spark

157
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,479
as for sources that help us

158
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,479
they are first of all

159
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,720
windows infrastructure

160
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,039
for windows infrastructure

161
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,639
volunteer

162
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,520
windows event forwarding it was

163
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,360
reincarnated

164
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,479
in broads projects

165
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,599
excellent project still developing and

166
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,210
it integrates

167
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:56,560
[Music]

168
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,639
your group policies

169
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,080
and subscriptions to all

170
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,759
events

171
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,400
don't forget ultimate window security a

172
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,919
huge

173
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,160
knowledge base which helps you

174
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,639
understand what is happening

175
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,199
build up your expertise

176
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,879
install sysmon modular for windows for

177
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,720
linux and to configure it you use sysmon

178
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,479
modular

179
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,120
that

180
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,400
installs

181
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,000
the tags

182
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,399
into the events and also in mitra

183
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,440
we also have attacks data sources the

184
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,919
data that you need to collect

185
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,480
we have good products for windows and

186
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,320
good products for linux as well

187
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,800
then detection

188
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,120
on the basis of collected logs we need

189
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,640
detection rules we begin with default

190
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,320
rules that

191
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,920
are included in cm then develop it in

192
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,279
community

193
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,560
use

194
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,800
sigma projects

195
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,120
use

196
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,880
vendor-based products

197
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,680
for example

198
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,760
elect electric secure elastic security

199
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,560
and try to understand how

200
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,160
do those rules work we need feedback

201
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,200
we need scripts and

202
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,120
templates to identify that this pipeline

203
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,560
detection

204
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,240
from start to finish

205
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,600
works

206
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,720
along the entire way we use the attack

207
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,959
emulation scripts

208
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:47,920
and

209
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,880
detection as a code paradigm that sigma

210
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,839
uses

211
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,800
helps us to build the chain from

212
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,800
development to testing and deployment

216
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,000
we start

217
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,560
we are part of the community open

218
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,320

using your infrastructure to understand

233
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,519
what really is happening

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,279
from the viewpoint of attackers

235
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,120
and then enrichment

236
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,959
we start with

237
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:05,839
uh

238
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,800

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,760
sources of enrichment

246
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,880
and

247
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,200
realize if we had so our product

248
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,440
i could identify

249
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,519
false positives

250
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,839
at the very

251
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,120
beginning so

252
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,800
as a result

253
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,399
i see

search systems like schrodinger tell us

what kind of ip addresses interact with

us

272
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,480
unfortunately it cannot be branched

273
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,760
but from the viewpoint of enrichment and

274
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,120
atomic actions it's excellent for your

275
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,720
stories

276
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,440
and since we talked about hive let's

277
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,160
talk about incident processing

278
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,760
to begin with

279
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,079
we have a simple ticket system that you

280
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,040
have we understand its limitations and

281
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,880
start using other scenarios describe the

282
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,040
conditions where when you

283
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,920
need additional action start building

284
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,639
additional scripts

285
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,560
analytical responsive some more actions

286
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,600
and see that we need an additional story

287
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,360
so our platform

288
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,959
for instance then

289
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,079
we add on the metrics

290
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,800
for incident response to understand how

291
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,560
efficient we are

292
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,320
average

293
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,560

294
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,500
response

295
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,079
[Music]

296
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,279
quality of logs

297
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,040
quality of correlation rules

298
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,480
with emulation scripts all that can

299
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,639
be

300
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,639
installed into one clear

301
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,560
framework and then

302
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,800
what

303
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,199
do we need what else do we need

304
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,279
we fix the results that we have now we

305
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,440
fix the road map

306
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,240
that the analyst

307
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,519
went through so that the next analyst

308
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,199
when analyzing the same kind of incident

309
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,040
uh wouldn't uh

310
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,160
generate something new invent

311
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,880
a wheel reinvent a bicycle

312
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,600
we have a lot of attributed

313
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,279
sources for

314
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,199
scenarios

315
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,199
some of them started before the

316
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,120
framework like

317
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,000
uh cert society

318
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,920
but 0.3 is most interesting it's phantom

319
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,920
community playbooks

320
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,720
which

321
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,480
helps you look at

322
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,720
incident response

323
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,680
from the viewpoint of

324
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,120
code which is transformed into response

325
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,639
code configuration files to interact

326
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,320
with different objects it's an

327
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,320
interesting story let's

328
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,959
wait and see how it's going to develop

329
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,600
whether it will be just a devops whether

330
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,920
it will be some

331
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,519
set of tools

332
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,959
points 4 and 5 are the projects

333
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,760
that are

334
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,199
most interesting for

335
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,240
mitra attacks

336
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,399
especially interesting is point four

337
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,600
apart from a clear

338
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,800
division between tactics

339
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,120
there are a lot of mental cards which

340
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,040
help analysts

341
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,320
to

342
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,079
look at the objects and build the red

343
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,000
hunting process

344
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,600
let's move on

345
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,279
ioc processing start with manual search

346
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:05,519
then we build cloud or on-prem services

347
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,759
and

348
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,279
forming our own expertise

349
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,839
our own threat intelligence on the basis

350
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,079
of the incidents that we processed we

351
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,040
build

352
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,320
a manageable process to range

353
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,759
subscription

354
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,399
by

355
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,880

efficiency

357
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,600
positives and false positives and then

358
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,199
we build a cloud of data

359
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,440
that are interrelated

360
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,680
by certain

361
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,560
things like who is or fingerprints or

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,240
certificates

363
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,560
to get as a result not just the

364
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,320
atomics but also

365
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,920
to take

366
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,480
techniques and tactics

00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,720
that would like to help us

368
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,639
find

369
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,800

376
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,679
an understanding of how it works you

377
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:33,039
need misp or alien vault just

378
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,120
and you can understand what kind of

379
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,640
techniques and tactics are used

380
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,080

00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,440
then

383
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,160
hunting hypothesis we start with the

384
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,559
initial search

385
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,640
then we build

386
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,440
automatic scripts

387
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,720
search requests and

388
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,200
run them in our dates the on our data

389
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,559
and on a real previously found attacks

390
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,320
to see how well our hypothesis works

391
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,640
we fix our data in a jupiter

392
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,880
notebooks

393
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,559
it's

394
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,799
a link between scripts and

395
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,679
and they help

396
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,480
us to share our hypothesis with

397
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,039
colleagues and with community if we

398
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,240
understand that this hypothesis works

399
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,559
but we cannot convert it into

400
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,960
the into the rules

401
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,919
we can just

402
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,840
install it for it to work to run and to

403
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,360
generate

404
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,400
events

405
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,480
for you

406
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,480
so we can use

407
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,990
specific signature analysis and

in the incident map

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,919
we can have information about references

example of how

00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,320
knowledge base should be organized

445
