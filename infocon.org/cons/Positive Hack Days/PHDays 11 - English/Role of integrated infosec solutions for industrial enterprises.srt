1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,240
the next story will be about protecting

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,000
industrial companies because industrial

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,280
companies are surrounding us they

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,599
manufacture electricity they assemble

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,680
cars they are steaming outside of our

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,199
doors this is something that we cannot

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,840
live without our daily activities are

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,359
not happening without those companies

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,400
and we're going to speak about

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,400
protecting these industrial companies

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,560
together with dmitry dolensky the head

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,519
of a practical of industrial security

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,840
and positive and anton chapulin manager

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,360
for the development of

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,280
industrial cyber security from kaspersky

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,800
lab

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,360
hi guys my first question will be to

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,559
both of you can you tell us please

19
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,079
why should we protect these smoking

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,640
chimneys

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,719
we need electricity we need food

22
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,640
products we need medications we need

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,600
to use transportation so any industrial

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,320
company infrastructural or manufacturing

25
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,000
one it's the same id infrastructure with

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,840
same

27
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,680
computers unique devices

28
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,360
which also subject to cyber attacks

29
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,640
and the damage and problems which can be

30
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,880
caused by cyber attacks are much more

31
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,520
significant than the cyber attack

32
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,400
against some business center

33
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,479
yes dima is right the main objective is

34
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,560
to provide

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,119
continuous flow of operations in the

36
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,439
company to provide services to the end

37
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,079
consumers users of the system and of

38
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,280
course prevent their inoperability which

39
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,840
might lead to the catastrophes with the

40
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,000
loss of monetary

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,960
damage to the human health and lives and

42
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,520
this is done not just by t security this

43
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,600
is done by business this is done by

44
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,920
physical security functional security

45
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,680
companies and these systems become more

46
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,880
and more digital i t factor becomes a

47
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,560
factor of threat that's why

48
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,639
informational security becomes this

49
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,640
fighter becomes the

50
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,640
founder which provides uh continuous

51
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,560
operations of the company

52
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,720
this means that industrial companies are

53
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,599
being broken or hackers do break into

54
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,560
them and they make some

55
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,800
practical things well in real life we

56
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,440
can say that speaking about our projects

57
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,040
especially when we directly work with

58
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,519
the clients we do see traces and

59
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,840
consequences of cyber attacks but due to

60
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,440
traditions and specifics

61
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,840
in the security industry

62
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,400
information

63
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,200
as a rule

64
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,000
so yes of course there are cases

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,159
the damage is real

66
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,879
i'm speaking about specific damage but

67
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,440
not many mass media companies are

68
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,200
publishing this information

69
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
anton you see the whole market

70
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,920
especially the kaspersky lab in uh this

71
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,280
country and outside of this country can

72
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,080
you make certain examples of uh

73
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,000
break-ins into industrial companies well

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,720
there's a lot of break-ins and hacks and

75
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,519
but we are security specialists we are

76
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,879
paranoid by our main idea we show risks

77
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,640
to business and we always tell them

78
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,200
about worse options that

79
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,200
with proper investments with proper

80
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,519
efforts from this side of hackers one

81
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,159
can achieve very negative consequences

82
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,239
as a damage to life and health of human

83
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,599
beings but if you look at the whole

84
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,920
history of attacks it would be honest to

85
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,840
say that never this system has led to

86
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,920
mortal cases it does mean that we have

87
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,599
to relax

88
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,599
on multiple occasions we had arguments

89
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,040
uh about uh some death effects we didn't

90
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,120
have any mortal cases but with time

91
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,360
people forget the first case

92
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,040
very very loud case it was in the

93
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,959
beginning of the year 20 in the year

94
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,400
2000 in australia

95
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,680
fired employee

96
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,840
have been able to dispose

97
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,959
could dispose

98
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,479
and damage the environment and there was

99
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,440
negative cases uh so there were some

100
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,360
damaging effects of these cases in case

101
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,919
when the production was shut down an

102
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,199
economical effect was very negative and

103
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,520
the specialized malicious code was

104
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,759
discovered before this damage was caused

105
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,080
and we know of such cases return system

106
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,199
and

107
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,479
and new cases are well known to us when

108
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,120
just uh recently in the course of this

109
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,280
year within one week we have published

110
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,759
information about attacks against energy

111
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,720
facilities

112
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,840
we've discovered a specialized software

113
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,800
which was making an attempt of using

114
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,520
in-built protocols uh schneider

115
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,919
electric unrun npc servers

116
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,039
without using any vulnerabilities

117
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,759
it's just enough to get access to those

118
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,800
services and uh speaking

119
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,080
about

120
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,600
lng gas facilities and it happens right

121
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,400
now it didn't lead fortunately to moral

122
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,479
cases but it shows us that this is a

123
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,880
real danger and believe in those days

124
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,400
well there is a myth

125
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,320
that hackers

126
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,080
are inside of those industrial

127
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,600
communities they're sitting all the time

128
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,280
there and many of them are sitting

129
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,840
inside of them is it a myth or is it a

130
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,680
truth of life and they are kind of

131
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,199
hiding and they're waiting for their

132
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,440
time

133
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:47,759
well

134
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,479
the traces of presence the traces of

135
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,720
exploitation vulnerabilities the traces

136
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,039
of attackers are discovered practically

137
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,039
in every second research in every second

138
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,120
pen test and analysis or in every second

139
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,560
company

140
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,960
but it's important to understand when we

141
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,240
speak about industrial company security

142
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,080
we are not speaking just about

143
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,120
protection of discarder or technological

144
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,600
network because the attack against

145
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,360
corporate systems

146
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,880
production or business system they also

147
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,680
are able to shut down the business

148
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,120
activities for example the story with

149
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,720
same colonial pipelines

150
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,479
the control systems of re-pumping of all

151
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,880
products they have not been attacked or

152
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,880
broken the business system was broken

153
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,560
and the company had to

154
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,400
shut down

155
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,600
so when you look at the protection of

156
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,120
the industrial company well you have to

157
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,440
look at it wider in a scale of the whole

158
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,440
infrastructure of the company and not

159
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,160
just narrowly in some specialized

160
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,960
technological systems

161
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,120
so speaking about corporate systems

162
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,199
business systems in the industrial

163
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,479
companies traces are discovered and

164
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,960
hackers

165
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,039
been speaking about another aspect that

166
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,080
comedy does not exist in the vacuum

167
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,759
the company has a supply chain the

168
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,919
company has relations with agents with

169
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,560
clients with suppliers

170
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,680
and what happened with colonial

171
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,240
pipelines it said that while the

172
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,160
technological process was shut down

173
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,520
through the business process without

174
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,840
attacking industrial automation

175
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,120
processes they have achieved the same

176
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,400
result and speaking about this point of

177
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,639
view well everybody's vulnerable there

178
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,560
is no ideal protection and there's no

179
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,639
ideally protected companies we know

180
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,080
about that and with the consideration of

181
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,360
the growth of integration of these

182
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,000
systems between each other

183
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,720
these lack of ideality is growing that's

184
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,360
why this interdependency between big

185
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,560
number of uh

186
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,759
technologies companies components of

187
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,080
vulnerable components non-reliable

188
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,599
foreign components

189
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,319
and we are able to see that this is an

190
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,199
objective situation that we have to

191
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,120
follow the concept you should look at

192
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,199
yourself as if you have already been

193
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,440
broken in without thinking about uh some

194
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,319
defense measures using the zero trust

195
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,599
concept you shouldn't trust components

196
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,440
inside of the network as absolutely

197
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,080
protected because you can already be

198
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,720
hacked you already might have an agent

199
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,039
inside of your company that's why and

200
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,720
this is a right approach from the point

201
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,280
of view uh well it's a paranoial

202
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,280
approach from the point of view of risk

203
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,039
management of our days risk management

204
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,599
well this is a proper approach i think

205
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,120
but what is the main specifics of

206
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,120
industrial companies compared to

207
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,159
business centers for example

208
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,120
well the specifics

209
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,519
this question about approaches how can

210
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,440
we yeah the specifics of protection

211
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,279
protection specifics i'm not going to

212
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,040
discover a big secret when i'm going to

213
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,399
tell you that

214
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,160
the principal approaches to security

215
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,399
technological segment they are not

216
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,800
different we use

217
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,839
same methodologies we use same product

218
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,680
classes the approaches and policies are

219
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,800
very similar to

220
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,800
corporate infrastructure policies and

221
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,040
there's a certain specifics that there's

222
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,640
unique unique software unique devices

223
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,560
and you should know how to work with

224
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,880
them

225
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,200
there is no big difference for us as a

226
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
company which is involved

227
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,720
in

228
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,200
developing these uh solutions uh for the

229
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,640
safety of industrial systems we don't

230
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,399
see big difference here

231
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,200
and in principle uh protection of these

232
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,920
companies a big question mark

233
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,640
irrespectively to whether it's a

234
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,320
technological system production

235
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,839
management system business systems

236
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,920
these approaches are not really

237
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,040
different

238
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,760
what

239
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,800
differs them

240
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,480
the approach is being changed from some

241
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,440
formalized common approach for everybody

242
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,680
in the it security industry it changes

243
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,000
to some applied approach in order to

244
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,040
have applied tangible result of all the

245
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,200
movements which security guys are making

246
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,959
in the manufacturing companies and i

247
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,399
will tell you more

248
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,720
to that for example outdated

249
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,440
approaches everybody's uh modeling

250
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,440
security threats but if you look at the

251
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,360
standard threat

252
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,079
of security uh to security of industrial

253
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,760
company it's not going to tell you in

254
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,680
which direction you should run what is

255
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,920
to be done and how can you achieve

256
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,880
maximum security effect with minimal

257
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,720
investments

258
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,399
that's why from this point of view the

259
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,240
development of approaches development of

260
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,360
methodologies generally speaking not in

261
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,240
respect to some separate domains or

262
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,680
systems

263
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,120
is moving in the right direction well

264
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,920
the decree of the president from the may

265
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,000
1st which was in respect to the

266
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
production of the critical companies

267
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,680
that certain responsibilities should be

268
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,200
inside of the organization and there was

269
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,959
another part of this decree which tells

270
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,600
us that by 2025 everybody should move to

271
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,640
domestic products domestic digital

272
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,480
products how

273
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,279
this is reflected in industrial

274
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,720
companies from the point of view of

275
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,880
industrial security is there any

276
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,040
difference is this as a kind of a

277
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,120
division line between the protection of

278
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,120
the industrial companies before this

279
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,600
decree and after this president's degree

280
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,560
or everything is the same

281
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,279
well this is a new decree and we

282
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,800
don't really understand what's going to

283
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,079
be about the situation in the future but

284
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,160
we understand that industrial companies

285
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,320
they started moving this direction and

286
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,640
this decree is pushing people to do what

287
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,279
had to be done previously

288
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,000
with federal law 187

289
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,120
critical infrastructure security

290
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,600
related law and if i remember it

291
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,480
reinforces requirements to any critical

292
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,560
infrastructure facilities not only the

293
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,839
most significant ones and there's a

294
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,600
certain misunderstanding about them so

295
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,360
right now they got more intense they

296
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,440
started looking for alternative means of

297
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,680
protection and we see this through the

298
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,480
demand so it has reinforced certain

299
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,839
increase of interest speed

300
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,000
yes we need availability of a

301
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,240
responsible person and it is being

302
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,680
defined that there should be a

303
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,440
responsible department within the

304
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,040
company so

305
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,120
it reinforces the priority of

306
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,560
informational security for the

307
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,720
industrial companies but we are going to

308
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,240
see in the future what's going to happen

309
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,360
here

310
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,360
well i would like to add to anton's

311
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,519
words everything is right but the main

312
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,079
idea is that we have to move in this

313
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,000
direction and we have to do a lot of

314
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,800
things

315
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,020
as for us

316
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,560
[Music]

317
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,040
it's not a secret we always have used an

318
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,360
approach before something explodes

319
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,079
nobody will do anything so this is a

320
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,399
wrong approach it's like a post factum

321
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,279
approach

322
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,480
it has been informing us that well

323
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,639
the explosion has happened you have to

324
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,880
run and you have no alternatives

325
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,800
everybody have to do something in this

326
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,120
area yes there was a certain peaceful

327
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,279
period everybody was thinking that well

328
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,200
we will get around it everything's going

329
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,760
to work and right now we've been told no

330
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,079
we have to move in this direction

331
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,480
well speaking about those solutions

332
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,240
to protect industrial companies what is

333
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,000
the main idea of them

334
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,839
as i understand the kaspersky lab has

335
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,920
its own solution positive technology has

336
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,600
its own solution but do you have any

337
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,839
common idea between them and what is the

338
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,760
difference we have

339
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,240
certain common functionality

340
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,040
we

341
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,800
yes we have different functionality but

342
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,240
from this point of view i see that our

343
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,920
company and

344
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,959
positive technologies are moving towards

345
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,160
the complex solution towards certain

346
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,360
extended detection uh response xdr when

347
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,040
the information is collected from

348
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,040
different sources

349
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,519
everything is being analyzed

350
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,680
attacks are being discovered

351
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,760
and certain responses being

352
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,079
done

353
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,040
to block these threats

354
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,719
considering the industrial specifics

355
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,320
but our companies are moving from

356
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,839
different directions

357
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,839
from different functionality the company

358
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,920
tries to use

359
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,560
those technologies which these companies

360
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,720
strong in and build their approach on

361
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,720
the basis of these technologies you use

362
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,680
with the use cm and other management we

363
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,320
use our new cm

364
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,160
our sandboxes

365
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,120
our

366
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,000
industrial traffic monitoring systems

367
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,680
so we are moving in the right direction

368
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,240
into complex protection into complex

369
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,360
automated defense

370
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,560
so when we speak about solutions for the

371
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,560
market the focus is

372
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,519
now we should always focus speaking

373
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,199
about companies and our partners

374
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,560
integrators

375
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,120
their focus was always been stopping on

376
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,519
technologies and techniques like

377
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,839
software hardware

378
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:06,800
but

379
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,600
right now we are moving in a direction

380
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,839
that we are looking at these solutions

381
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,120
only as technological stack or product

382
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,320
stack but certain set of methodologies

383
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,519
and approaches with help of which these

384
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,800
solutions can be implemented

385
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,199
and even starting

386
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,480
with the story of making inadmissible to

387
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,079
become impossible

388
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,959
a stack of technologies and products

389
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,440
first of all

390
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,920
is using this technology and methodology

391
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,560
and this methodology is being offered on

392
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,199
the market so how the industrial company

393
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,680
irrespectively from the industry like is

394
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,160
it a steel mining company or electrical

395
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,639
energy company how can they

396
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,000
use this first approach

397
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,600
properly

398
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,959
how can they properly understand their

399
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,360
own risks how they can properly build

400
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,160
processes and how can they choose

401
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,920
technological products and solutions

402
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,920
solving this problem so from our side

403
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,720
our approach looks like that

404
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,120
do you feel competition between

405
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,519
yourselves on the market

406
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,440
well we do participate in all the

407
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,480
tenders and contests and this is good

408
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,040
competition is always good

409
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,839
so you don't let each other to relax we

410
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,920
are thankful to our competitors they

411
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,440
make us better

412
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,279
yeah they make us better

413
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,399
and stronger so this is wonderful

414
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,079
we are friends

415
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,920
and we are competitors at the same time

416
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,360
and it should be like that

417
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,959
this is wonderful

418
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,240
i'm glad to see that you have healthy

419
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,920
competition between yourself which in

420
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,480
the end ron will help you to make those

421
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,560
products

422

to make products

426
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,799
whose operation will prevent

427
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,240
explosions will prevent emissions will

428
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,160
prevent shutdowns of electricity or any

429
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,119
other negative events will be prevented
