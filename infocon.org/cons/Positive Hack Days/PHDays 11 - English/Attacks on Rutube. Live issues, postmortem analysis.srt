1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,960
have been filled with different cyber

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,440
incidents and the brightest of them were

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,719
the events which happened with root tube

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,719
a couple words about what happened and

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,239
what is right now we will speak with

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,920
alexander muycf deputy ceo in gas pro

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,920
media holding hello sasha

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,640
and alexey nobikov director of expert

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,960
security center in positive technologies

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,199
okay let's begin with a simple question

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,479
what did happen 8th of may

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,120
8th of may nothing happened but may 9th

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,600
in the morning root tube stopped working

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,200
as we all know

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,360
this this was inaccessible but in real

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,079
life what happened

17
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,559
very serious attack happened

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,719
then we will discuss a little bit later

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,600
about how this attack was conducted

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,800
technical details

21
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,038
what

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,680
so there was a serious penetration but

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,760
in practice it was a big infrastructural

24
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,879
attack

25
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,040
they've tried

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,360
to do a lot of negative things

27
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,119
and what has suffered

28
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,880
first of all infrastructure have

29
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,320
suffered

30
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,158
service components have suffered

31
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,799
and we were able to save the video

32
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,400
archive which is the most important

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,640
thing

34
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,280
of connectedness have suffered is the

35
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,600
base which provides connectedness

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,439
between video archives and user data

37
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,560
user data was not tackled unfortunately

38
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,880
and whole infrastructure as well

39
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,280
so this is cluster of virtualization etc

40
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,880
which were the goals of the criminals

41
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,680
attackers why they did make this attack

42
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,880
do you have any understanding

43
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,960
i

44
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,399
you didn't get any anonymous statements

45
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,840
uh like

46
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,640
letters cut from the newspapers

47
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,119
well they don't write to our telegram

48
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,479
but maybe you've been like they've been

49
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,440
writing to telegram and there were even

50
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,400
some stories

51
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,239
in some channels that something like

52
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,239
that is about to happen which goals i

53
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,680
don't know nothing good they didn't have

54
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,319
any good goals but obviously technically

55
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,720
what we've seen the goal was full

56
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,400
destruction of the service full

57
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,239
destruction of the service

58
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,680
another thing should be understood we

59
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,760
are not speaking about gigantic flash

60
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,160
which can play video but this is a very

61
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,000
complicated infrastructure with very

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,080
complicated distributed network

63
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,160
orchestration virtualization and all

64
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,319
other favorite words that we hear every

65
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,560
day and the objective was to completely

66
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,160
destroy it completely annihilated and we

67
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,800
were able to a stop it and b

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,080
i think that generally speaking very

69
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,680
short periods of time it was very

70
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,760
painful yes we haven't been sleeping for

71
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,080
50 hours but we were able to revitalize

72
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,680
it positive technologies helps in

73
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,519
investigation of this incident tell me

74
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,360
please uh alexi do we have any

75
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,080
understanding who attacked how this

76
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,720
attack was conducted and how was it

77
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,720
developed

78
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,800
yes we are helping and we work together

79
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,400
with our colleagues in investigating

80
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,920
this incident investigating this case

81
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,560
the question how it's not my favorite

82
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,799
question not how about who

83
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,440
because to the question who

84
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,959
it should be answered only by law

85
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,360
enforcement agencies and we are involved

86
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,239
in analysis of technical data analysis

87
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,840
of those techniques and tactics that

88
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,400
were applied in those technical traces

89
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,640
which are present in infrastructure

90
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,760
which should help us to build the chain

91
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,480
of events in chronologically

92
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,120
and show us where the criminal was uh

93
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,159
what was he doing how was he doing that

94
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,560
uh where did he enter the system so at a

95
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,840
given moment of time the most important

96
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,280
thing is a data collection

97
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,000
we collect analysis verification of this

98
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,599
data

99
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,080
and the answer to the question

100
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,879
how

101
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,879
it was done because from the point of

102
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,360
view of even probability of this service

103
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,759
in the future the answer to the question

104
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,120
how is the most important question

105
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,759
because we should do it in such a way so

106
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,400
that these attacks would never happen

107
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,400
again

108
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,680
what do you think what do you get from

109
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,400
your data how long was this attack

110
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,770
prepared

111
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,240
[Music]

112
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,040
well

113
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,040
there's a lot of traces dated by april

114
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,360
working in april of this year yes april

115
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,040
of this year

116
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,880
the working infrastructure

117
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,759
definitely it cannot be done in one day

118
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,360
from point of penetration to those

119
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,400
destructive actions that were executed

120
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,360
it's impossible to do such a thing

121
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,960
within one day in such a scale

122
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,039
what is interesting

123
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,600
is that there's a lot of data because uh

124
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,759
it's a distributed structure and a lot

125
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,000
of things have to be analyzed

126
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,560
but we can speak about tools

127
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,960
and basically

128
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,440
the hypothesis is being confirmed which

129
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,120
we've been speaking about about other

130
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,400
cases as well

131
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,360
that criminals are using publicly

132
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,160
accessible tools which are present with

133
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,880
special frameworks and

134
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,560
in some nodes uh they had cobblestrike

135
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,560
present it's a well-known tool which

136
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,919
commercially

137
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,560
is being positioned as a tool for pen

138
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,199
testers

139
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,919
then criminals have used and they

140
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,280
understand tool

141
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,759
uh which tool can be used inside of an

142
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,199
infrastructure and being legible and

143
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,400
they've used

144
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,960
the same tools which are used in daily

145
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,919
life

146
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,080
for it admins in order to move inside of

147
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,039
the infrastructure research it etc

148
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,280
different scanners we can see that in

149
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,039
the infrastructure that they've been

150
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,080
learning about the infrastructure

151
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,280
they've been scanning it they've been

152
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,080
looking at open places network access

153
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,440
possibilities

154
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,680
and we can see

155
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,479
that it was done

156
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,680
not within few hours

157
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,600
how gas prone media have learned about

158
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,039
the attack and what was the first

159
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,199
reaction

160
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,759
the first reaction to attract

161
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,560
specialists it was questionless without

162
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,800
any questions and we

163
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,440
have spent a lot of time to security and

164
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,199
uh first of all we're speaking about

165
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,120
users we should provide good quality

166
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,520
content to end users as for the

167
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,840
information security especially of such

168
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,199
incidents investigation the most

169
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,639
important thing the most important thing

170
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,800
is to attract specialists

171
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,400
because

172
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,560
let's look well this is a criminal

173
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,639
offense which requires a certain

174
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,280
understanding and non-specialist if he's

175
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,720
attracted he should understand how to

176
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,400
work with these materials so first of

177
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,720
all we have invited partners

178
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,479
to not us and separately i would like to

179
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,400
say that guys

180
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,639
thank you very much

181
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,599
first of all thanks uh for the fact at

182
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:16,800
the moment when there's a lot of

183
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,479
advisers and haters and uh big you know

184
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,400
couch fighters who knows how to do it

185
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,840
properly

186
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,319
you guys from positive and some other

187
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,960
partners you just came to our bunny

188
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,039
street and since the morning we all were

189
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,199
in office and we all were investigating

190
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,599
we just started doing it

191
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,880
we'd learned about it at 5 00 a.m

192
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,400
on monitors we could see it a little bit

193
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
earlier but when we started studying it

194
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,800
in depth we have understood how

195
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,960
important was it and the target attack

196
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,360
was at 4am

197
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,639
i don't know why

198
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,319
so

199
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,080
our monitoring started working

200
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,919
accessibility of the services started

201
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,120
and then we started uh deploying uh the

202
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,800
reaction we have reacted very fast and

203
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,919
in my understanding the speed of

204
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,919
reaction has allowed us to

205
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,319
minimize the damage and the proper work

206
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,879
and proper hands

207
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,479
they helped us to find uh the ways to

208
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,560
mitigate this problem how fast have you

209
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,800
restored the main services and how much

210
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,120
time did it take for the full

211
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,120
restoration

212
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,879
well it took us 50 hours more than two

213
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,120
days yeah more than two days this is

214
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,160
exactly

215
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,840
how much people didn't sleep and they

216
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,479
were doing it but this is a usability

217
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,159
bringing up main services and main

218
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,479
comments about video delivery we're

219
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,919
speaking about things like

220
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,480
access to data storage indexation

221
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,680
carousel and other main services

222
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,640
another example like streaming they came

223
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,880
back later things like

224
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,160
loading video later personal cabinet uh

225
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,200
started working just recently as such uh

226
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,880
search started almost immediately but

227
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,560
the problem is due to the fact that due

228
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,760
to certain uh tags we

229
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,839
had to re-index the whole database

230
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,720
but right now we are not working 100 of

231
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,720
capacity we are lifting our services on

232
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,320
step-by-step basis and problem is

233
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,000
related with the fact that

234
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
these guys they know

235
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,360
that we are very carefully looking for

236
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,920
all the data where can we find any

237
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,640
artifacts or injections

238
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,040
and they have left a lot of injections

239
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,360
which have to be removed

240
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,320
injections in the source code scripts

241
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,399
everything that can be relaunched again

242
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,200
and somehow bring some additional damage

243
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,839
so we are cleaning these alongside uh

244
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,480
the services are being uploaded so we do

245
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,640
this work on step-by-step basis it will

246
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,240
take a while but from the good side of

247
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,360
it using this situation we have updated

248
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,120
some of our mobile application their

249
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,880
interface and

250
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,120
we had some updates planned for the

251
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,360
future we started updating them now

252
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,600
alexi will you publish the results of

253
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,880
this investigation and if yes when

254
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,360
well it's a very complicated question

255
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,160
it's not in our practice or experience

256
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,000
to solve will there be published or not

257
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,880
but who decides that first of all

258
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,480
owners of the infrastructure make this

259
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,240
decision so i will re-address this

260
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,040
question to them

261
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,760
and this is not the only party there are

262
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,480
no participants of the dialogue who are

263
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,760
addressing this question it depends on

264
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,399
heavy is the article to which the east

265
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,279
because it's a criminal act

266
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,600
and criminal prosecution uh and there

267
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,040
are certain investigation which is being

268
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,640
conducted and upon the results of it

269
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,399
decisions will be made what can become

270
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,279
public and what will stay not public

271
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,760
but what are the forecasts will you find

272
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,200
the

273
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,480
criminals

274
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,200
we want to find the criminals definitely

275
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,680
we want to find them

276
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,680
even though first of all

277
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,519
with all our

278
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,000
activities it's very important that root

279
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,959
tube right now is not sick it's healthy

280
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,320
it's working on a full scale and it will

281
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,480
follow our road map user is the most

282
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,480
important for us and let's speak about

283
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,279
that

284
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,200
let's say uh something that you call

285
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,360
root chick well there were different

286
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,880
perceptions to root you but even before

287
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,560
these events which have happened

288
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,720
i will tell you even more most of the

289
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,640
people didn't like it because of the

290
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,279
inconvenience of the services but will

291
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,360
this incident lead to some significant

292
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,000
review of your

293
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
opinions about the root tube well the

294
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,560
story is much more complicated well last

295
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,880
year we have decided

296
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,480
that it wouldn't be

297
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,079
bad to go to one

298
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,800
one 21 million users uh

299
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,480
so we accumulate a certain volume of

300
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,120
functionality we roll out some features

301
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,079
uh

302
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,240
audience come for the features it grows

303
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,399
so we calculate the user base and it

304
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,680
lives like that

305
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,680
however the life brings its own

306
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,519
corrections and we have executed the

307
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,040
plan of the end of the year and

308
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,800
somewhere in april we have failed the

309
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,560
plan of the last of next year

310
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,279
infrastructure was launched very

311
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,519
fast we had problems with moderation

312
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,600
it's a complicated problem not our

313
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,920
problem we were not ready for such

314
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,560
volume of traffic and most likely our

315
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,560
desire

316
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,399
and the requirement of the legislation

317
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,880
and we have to follow uh the legislation

318
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,399
about fakes and control everything that

319
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,240
comes to the platform

320
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,399
we have so much content for moderation

321
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,320
it takes a lot of time and this is

322
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,000
something that was fixed

323
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,040
point number two is that many users when

324
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,519
they leave youtube they required that

325
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,360
this platform would look like youtube so

326
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,680
some new functionality was coming and

327
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,040
it's connected to the fact that we

328
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,440
wanted to give the replies and responses

329
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,440
which would bring users closer to

330
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,040
youtube

331
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,440
and starting from april we started

332
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,720
rolling out the roadmap of the

333
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,160
functionality that we wanted to have in

334
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,680
the beginning we don't have an objective

335
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,000
of making clone of youtube no way and

336
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,760
this is wonderful because the next

337
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,480
question i had to you is what is youtube

338
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,800
is an ideal uh in in in the direction

339
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,200
you're striving for what is the beauty

340
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,200
of root tube today youtube today is a

341
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,000
platform surprise me

342
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,480
tube today if you will look uh changes

343
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,240
of this platform has not been changing

344
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,000
it was changing listening to the users

345
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,279
yes we're changing everything that

346
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,800
people want to change

347
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,839
yeah there were difficulties with

348
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,680
moderation they've corrected it there

349
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,079
were certain desires uh top button

350
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,320
because users wanted to to have it and

351
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,320
they wanted to black topic and you know

352
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,920
there are simple things

353
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,760
externally but it requires a lot of

354
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,079
changes in the source code and we try to

355
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,160
fulfill all the desires of the end users

356
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,680
you know prioritization roadmap et

357
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,600
cetera et cetera et cetera so today the

358
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,760
uniqueness of this situation is that we

359
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,399
are together and we can do uh national

360
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,720
video hosting people want it and

361
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,079
everything that people want we can hear

362
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,440
it we can collect all this information

363
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,079
we have a big audience today and

364
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,320
user desire give us a possibility to

365
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,839
make the platform which can be

366
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,680
convenient for us

367
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,240
like the one that it's supposed to be

368
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,399
and should we be a clone of some foreign

369
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,720
platform i will tell you why not

370
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,120
no foreign platform in the future in

371
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,040
multinational holding will not be able

372
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,240
to execute local needs satisfy local

373
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,120
needs but today russian users somehow

374
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,320
have to adopt for the youtube many

375
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,480
habits are because youtube is like that

376
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,160
not because it's convenient for me but

377
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,880
because they define the fashion it's a

378
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,480
consequence and we would like to change

379
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,760
this and would like to give people

380
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,440
something they want and something that

381
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,199
is interesting to them and first of all

382
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,800
we have an objective of this platform is

383
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,120
to make some social lift so you can

384
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,800
create some creative things you can post

385
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,120
videos this is standard video hosting

386
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,240
from the point of view of doing

387
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,320
something posting something promoting it

388
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,079
voting for this but honestly speaking

389
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,639
root tube is a part of big media holding

390
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,079
the biggest media holding where you have

391
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,000
a lot of opportunities and possibilities

392
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,199
from the point of view maintenance

393
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,440
monetization okay youtube have switched

394
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,240
on a motivation in youtube we have roots

395
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,240
we have it and in-house monetization it

396
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,920

through this single window and you

398
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,560
shouldn't think about it you should

399
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,000
think about your creativeness you create

400
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,199
those videos you post them then

401
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,839
if you will be seen you will be enrolled

402
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,639
into another platform where you can make

403
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,240
videos a cinema and you have a big

404
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,000
horizon where you can develop yourself

405
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,600
and this is a wonderful beautiful story

406
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,759
with a staircase by which creative

407
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,600
people can grow and root you today this

408
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,199
is about that and this is something that

409
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,399
would like to become and you know

410
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,720
listening desires of our users but will

411
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,720
it be possible to see some public plans

412
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,000
for the development of the root you

413
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,160
because this is a big attention

414
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,320

speaking about right now but public

416
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,199
video hosting that everybody would

417
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,680
participate in its development and

418
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,600
people right now can bring all their

419
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,680
ideas and you will be able to do

420
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,560
something explosive but will it be seen

421

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,519
will come to the platform on the

431
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,519
step-by-step basis will teach people how

432
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,560
to use it and we'll speak about the

433
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,160
functionality that will be implemented

434
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,839
everything will be there and right now

435
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,440
there's a high demand for different

436
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,160
entertainment show blog show

437
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,959
and we will in reinforce our platform

438
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,199
online in routine well gaspron media

439
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,240
holding is a big resource which owns a

440
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,440
lot of informational sources

441
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,959
for the wide audience of our country

442
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,079
have you ever seen attacks against other

443
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,720
media resources or media holdings

444
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
well you know i would like to add to

445
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,040
your question i will make it more acute

446
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,680
recently

447
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,639
people suddenly started getting more

448
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,880
educated and everybody

449
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,599
know a lot of terms about pt attacks

450
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,160
deed dogs attacks

451
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,559
but you have made big input into the

452
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,599
education and evangelization of the info

453
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,480
security and info hygiene and the first

454
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,799
thing they've asked us tell us please

455
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,919
they've said uh can you give us details

456
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,079
of the dos attack against rutube well

457
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,480
what attack did you have

458
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,400
four users entered and now six years

459
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,200
well speaking about ddos attacks

460
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,960
in current realities well

461
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,440
it's something basic

462
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,280
i'm not asking about ddos i'm asking

463
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,240
principle

464
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,600
well if you divide into different

465
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,679
categories well ddos became something

466
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,760
daily and services are constantly

467
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,600
somebody tries to put them down some

468
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,400
other attacks are happening permanently

469
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,360
but

470
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,039
are they planned as well are they

471
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,880
technically studied and well prepared

472
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,320
well it's different but generally

473
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,200
speaking i think that

474
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,200
all the details well i'm not going to

475
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,799
tell you all these details but we are

476
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,559
working this direction and generally

477
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,640
speaking we try to stop it in maximum

478
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,799
but answering your question yes and a

479
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,880
lot yes and a lot

480
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,960
of

481
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,640
you own a big media resource which is

482
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,400
going to provide the information for and

483
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,080
there's a lot of criminals which have

484
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,000
cyber guns and we have to protect

485
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,679
ourselves and from the point of view of

486
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,280
cyber security from the point of view of

487
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,840
defense which conclusions did you come

488
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,520
to

489
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,520
will you review uh defense radically

490
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,440
well big changes from the point of view

491
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,760
of cyber security we introduced in the

492
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,039
last six months and this is why we were

493
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,039
able to stay

494
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,880
alive and right now we're moving in our

495
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,480
road map and we are going to just

496
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,799
reinforce it so the roadmap is

497
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,240
understandable plan is understandable

498
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,600
and we should move forward we should

499
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,000
improve and increase these uh

500
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,080
security measures networking we cannot

501
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,760
do it alone

502
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,679
and the situation is following we live

503
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,080
in a world where everybody we have to

504
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,600
unite together in the information

505
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,760
security there is no other ways what do

506
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,440
you mean by uniting in the informational

507
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,799
security world

508
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:13,600
well

509
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,799
there are not many players in

510
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,240
informational security in russia too

511
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,400
one is sitting here

512
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,799
with very cool competencies

513
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,640
some competencies can be provided by

514
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,960
other players some can grow up and but

515
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,520
it's important right now so that people

516
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,360
who are strong and competent there are

517
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,520
few of them in the market

518
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,440
and we have wonderful opportunity right

519
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,480
now

520
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,400
division is which you die toaster it

521
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,880
sounds like statements uh we should hold

522
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,240
the hands and we do have such an

523
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,280
opportunity yes we should withstand all

524
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,799
these dirty things which are happening

525
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,240
in the market and then you know

526
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,240
something that doesn't kill us makes us

527
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,280
stronger

528
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,559
and it's a beautiful opportunity to

529
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,639
become even stronger can we

530
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,760
looking forward uh at least in the media

531
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,840
segment can we become cyber

532
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,240
defended from the point of view of media

533
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,159
on the national level can we and do we

534
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,000
have such an opportunity yes we do and

535
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,919
which role can be played by positive in

536
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,480
this story

537
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,600
well it is very important

538
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,000
i think that we already have learned

539
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,840
about a lot of details and we have a lot

540
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,280
of good beginnings

541
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,918
good start

542
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,480
perhaps it's not that moment when we are

543
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,480
going to tell you in details and we plan

544
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,120
a certain session on st petersburg's uh

545
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,039
international forum and we are going to

546
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,559
tell you about all of this can you tell

547
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,919
me please what's going to happen there

548
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,840
there's going to be a session that will

549
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,520
be

550
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,120
organized by gaspron media we're going

551
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,200
to tell in more detail about incidents

552
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,120
but from the point of view

553
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,000
of non-technical part but more about end

554
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,720
users about which effect they get and

555
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,880
honestly speaking

556
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,320
we would like to look at the situation

557
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,000
differently not like uh today root tube

558
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,120
was attacked and today all the users

559
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,280
have been attacked who came to routine

560
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,880
and those viewers who've been watching

561
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,679
it

562
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,440
in addition to that we would like to

563
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,320
speak

564
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,080
which steps and actions we will do

565
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,520
together from the information security

566
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,640
point of view

567
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,039
thank you very much

568
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,720
something that doesn't kill us makes us

569
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,640
stronger that's why i do hope that these

570
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,720
lessons that we have learned will allow

571
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,640
us not only to increase the level of

572
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,640
cyber security but also be able to

573
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,600
review our services

574
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,559
and

575
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,159
make them much better than those western

576
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,480
analogies that we've had by now and

577
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,039
which obviously we will have to replace

578
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,840
alexander messier alexi novikov

579
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,120
about root tube
