1
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,000
good morning my name is angelica

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,639
svoykena i'm a pre-sale manager at

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,120
security vision and today we're going to

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,480
talk about effective interaction between

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,119
soa and cm systems

6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,359
to start with

7
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,320
let's remember a good lcm

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,439
i'm sure

9
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,359
all of you know how it works

10
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,960
these are disparate sources of data

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,680
correlation rules incidents discovery

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,280
from different sources

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,399
tens of millions incidents per day

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,680
for which

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,800
professionals should pay attention to

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,079
they should see them respond to them

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,160
past different logs and identify

18
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,239
anomalies

19
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,440
in each

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,800
sock

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,680
there's

22
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,719
their own

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,760
process

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,559
of

25
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,160
processing and closing of incidents as a

26
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,879
rule it includes different steps

27
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,159
uh collection of information

28
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,960
routine actions that a person needs to

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,000
make and as rule each step takes some

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,119
time

31
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,640
from the professional the professional

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,720
spends their precious time

33
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,200
and talking about precedence what has

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,240
changed

35
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,520
since the start of 2022. firstly

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,400
they have become much more numerous if

37
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,439
you compare with q1 21 then in the

38
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,280
beginning of 2021 the number of

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,200
incidents grew uh by the factor of more

40
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,320
than four

41
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,960
so the biggest upsurge of incidents

42
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,600
could be observed since the

43
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,360
end of february

44
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,280
you to notice that even though

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,079
there have been much more incidents the

46
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,920
share of smart attacks has gone down it

47
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,600
can be explained by the fact that now

48
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,759
many rank-and-file users uh connect to

49
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,520
the bot networks

50
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,680
they view different instructions let's

51
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,439
say in telegram channels they use

52
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,479
exploits and they can start attacking

53
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,320
from their personal devices

54
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,479
these people these attacks have become

55
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,640
more numerous but they haven't become

56
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,600
more

57
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
complicated and routine processing of

58
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,440
these incidents is quite simple of

59
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,160
course the specialists will be burning

60
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,720
out closing uh dozens and hundreds of

61
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,120
incidents absolutely the same

62
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,000
not exciting and not complicated

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,120
of course

64
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,120
the duration of the attacks has also

65
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,800
changed if in the past the attacks were

66
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,400
measured in minutes and hours now

67
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,720
several now some attacks can last for

68
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,200
several days and what does it lead to it

69
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,560
leads to a huge load on and on stock

70
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,519
analysts

71
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,319
there are many more attacks

72
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,959
they have become the same they have

73
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,440
started to last longer

74
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,800
and how do you think

75
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,280
you can take off this load from our

76
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,160
analysts how we can help them

77
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,480
a representative which company am i of

78
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,800
course so our platforms

79
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,640
the soma platform

80
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,319
is exactly intended to automate the

81
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,560
incident response to bring down the

82
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,480
response time to leave the precious time

83
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,280
for

84
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,440
uh invest the investigation of more

85
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,920
complicated incidents let's now talk

86
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,440
about

87
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,239
some basic interactions between soar and

88
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,159
cm systems firstly it's ticketing

89
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,480
ticketing is about collection uh

90
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,560
collecting and enriching data from

91
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,200
different sources what do i need to note

92
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,519
modern sem systems

93
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:28,879
have

94
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,560
don't have a

95
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,720
fully fledged engine

96
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,200
for ticket processing most companies

97
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,400
have

98
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,599
to

99
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,920
start incidents in

100
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,920
other systems hotdesk it could be zero

101
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,440
spsm and others but these systems also

102
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,959
don't have a fully fledged process to

103
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,760
close incidents

104
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,280
work processes workflows to automate and

105
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,879
respond to any sense

106
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,280
so what workflows are using used for

107
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,360
that to write algorithms

108
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,599
to automate the response

109
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,040
workflows

110
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,680
are basically

111
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,720
flow charts based on correlation engine

112
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,640
you can use

113
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,360
past transactions come back to the

114
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,320
previous step or do it in a cyclic way

115
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,880
or run check several times

116
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,079
connected one should also note that most

117
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,919
of our platforms

118
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,440
when interacting with acm systems use a

119
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,479
unilateral interaction that's uh so

120
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,240
incidentally generating the soar

121
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,320
platform

122
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,840
after some

123
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,520
triggered by some alert

124
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,199
unilaterally

125
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,040
this

126
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,360
well our technology allows us doing it

127
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,840
in both directions cm can send commands

128
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,199
and we can remotely control cm uh using

129
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,600
the connector

130
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,639
this is an example

131
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,400
this is

132
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,360
basically a real life case

133
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,600
to show how a basic

134
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,800
incident

135
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,639
such as contamination

136
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,520
is

137
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,440
processed here you see certain actions

138
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,960
they can change

139
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,560
and depending on

140
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,479
the company on the playbook they can

141
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,520
build it with different but

142
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,479
the process is about the same

143
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,120
and we see that every step

144
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,039
like a setting of remote commands

145
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,919
instruction a certain event

146
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,000
they all take some time

147
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,440
and the soma platform

148
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,680
allows responding

149
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,680
many many times

150
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,440
faster

151
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,560
also oh what's important

152
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,680
again

153
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,240
here we have a workflow

154
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,720
showing that if before the solar

155
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,960
implementation it takes an hour or an

156
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,800
hour and a half after the implementation

157
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,840
it takes just a few minutes

158
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,759
so this can be this is what automation

159
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,960
does

160
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,840
okay

161
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,000
we've seen the incidents there are

162
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,639
several of them

163
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,880
the response has come faster but what if

164
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,560
these incidents are hundreds and

165
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,000
thousands uh you can imagine how fast

166
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,240
the saw can respond with the help of our

167
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,520
technology

168
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,039
of course it's all great we've talked

169
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,000
about basic interactions

170
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,479
let's now talk about interactions that

171
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,560
are not

172
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,680
basic

173
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,680
what can i talk about

174
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,880
firstly

175
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,680
efficiency checking what do i mean

176
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,360
by this now

177
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,000
we are looking at beginning to emulate

178
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
based on the attack pattern to emulate a

179
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,319
script

180
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,560
that would

181
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,400
emulate some malicious software

182
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,039
what do we do every attack has its own

183
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,080
pattern

184
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,680
and we

185
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,039
when

186
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,280
the trigger trigger files for this

187
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,919
attack can remotely launch it in our

188
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,160
scenario and see how the incident is

189
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,080
going to be closed uh looking through

190
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,160
all the laws from the start from

191
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,160
identification to the complete closure

192
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,599
so we can look through

193
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,120
the incident closure process completely

194
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,199
seeing how all these events are

195
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,400
generated what level of security the

196
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,000
company has

197
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,639
that will allow us to

198
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,800
get a more accurate

199
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,960
assessment of

200
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,080
what level of maturity

201
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,599
security is

202
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,400
in this company

203
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,720
because cm is connect is collecting data

204
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,800
from all sources

205
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,440
this entails in a huge volume of data

206
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,680
it becomes a great source

207
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,160
from which you can take data and analyze

208
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,319
it within so on using specific

209
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,879
analysis tools review some events like

210
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,960
for instance which hosts are sending

211
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,639
security events where this process is

212
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,720
working where it isn't

213
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,960
for this we have this incident data lake

214
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,199
you can use it to build any kind of

215
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,680
statistic

216
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,160
view how incidents are closed and also

217
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,440
and maybe make some conclusions

218
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,639
threat hunting in real time

219
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,199
so how does hem work in cm you set a

220
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,840
correlation tools correlation rules

221
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,479
they identify incidents statistically

222
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,559
for instance if you have some anomaly

223
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,320
and it's not already built into cm cm

224
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,880
can't find an incident in real time it

225
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,120
could be a zero day attack or some other

226
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,320
anomaly

227
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,920
that

228
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,560
will correlate with the previous events

229
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,120
we are now looking the same direction

230
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,519
we collect all these data and in real

231
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,480
time i find the incidents so of all the

232
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,320
traffic we find the outliers the

233
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,360
anomalies

234
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,279
if you're uh interested to learn more

235
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,680
about this it's indeed a very good

236
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,519
presentation my colleague i spoke

237
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,519
yesterday about this

238
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,279
topic uh

239
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,279
finding anomalies in data using uh

240
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,920
neural networks on the cn platform you

241
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,839
can watch it in

242
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,519
record as recorded

243
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,360
and of course

244
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,920
reports and and analytics everybody

245
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,440
needs that

246
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,920
the management needs that

247
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,440
rank and file users need that need them

248
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,640
you

249
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,600
have to use them to see your dynamic how

250
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,640
long does it take to close an incident

251
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,480
so you can set to different timers for

252
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,959
the triggers uh so that the incident

253
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,399
should be closed within a certain time

254
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,560
and so on and so forth now

255
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,120
we are also working in this direction

256
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,640
all the analytics

257
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,839
that

258
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,360
a professional

259
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,920
is running is done within this platform

260
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,800
and then the analyst can

261
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,519
enter some formula how to identify

262
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,200
outliers

263
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,920
also designed the data dashboards and if

264
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,279
the specialist goes away from the

265
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,959
company leaves the company uh the

266
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,440
company's the comp his competency stays

267
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,760
within the platform and the next uh

268
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,560
analyst uh does not have to does not

269
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,800
have to start from scratch

270
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,440
they have all the heritage of the

271
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,560
previous analysts and this in its turn

272
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,000
improves uh the effectiveness of

273
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,480
a sock analyst work

274
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,640
in addition to that it's of course being

275
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,839
able uh to organize graphs

276
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,480
her view through events from a specific

277
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,839
asset

278
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,240
viewing uh through its history

279
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,360
uh how the software has been updated and

280
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,360
everything of course part of this is

281
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,600
available from cm but using cm data and

282
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,160
your own mechanism allows enriching the

283
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,200
data

284
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,760
all the way to improving the security so

285
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,680
we have talked about

286
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,920
some security events but in addition to

287
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,880
that

288
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,519
you can automate

289
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,959
the activities

290
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,640
that

291
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,880
happens in the 80 departments

292
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,760
maybe

293
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,839
antivirus solution updating network

294
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,200
scanning blocking and blocking of

295
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,800
accounts

296
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,600
account issuance all this routine work

297
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,399
that

298
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,120
the it department is doing but of course

299
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,440
it correlates with information security

300
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,320
so

301
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,320
there's always an opportunity there's

302
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,880
also an opportunity of automating this

303
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,920
so that people should not spend time

304
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,480
that is so valuable in the current

305
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,480
situation so thank you all for your

306
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,760
attention and maybe you have some

307
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,440
questions

308
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,279
so that i could cover something in more

309
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,680
detail

310
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,760
i see no questions

311
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,560
well in the beginning of presentation i

312
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,360
showed my email address if you get any

313
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,480
questions

314
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,959
please write me

315
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,639
so i'm hoping that we'll keep working

316
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,200
successfully improving security thank

317
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,720
you everyone and i'm passing the floor

318
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,839
to the next speaker
