1
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,519
i have a lot to say last year i gave you

2
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,519
specific examples of uh

3
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,119
investigations and today i'm going to

4
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,520
tell you more about methodology with

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,840
examples and that will be interesting to

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,600
the colleagues who are at the beginning

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,800
of their way and those who are

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,119
well on the way it will be interesting

9
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,238
to see what kind of tools we use and how

10
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,120
this is what i'm going to say

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,160
first

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,520
theory and then practical examples and

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,480
cats

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,399
cats help security do you know that

15
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,600
uh

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,640
that will be and discovery for you

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,160
we shall have

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,320
cats here

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,120
and

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,239
the person who is most attentive will

21
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,680
get the prize

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,920
how many cats and on which slides so we

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,439
have three prizes

24
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,080
cats will help you

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,880
so

26
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,799
what are we going to investigate

27
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,080
at the workstation of your employee any

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,920
action

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,000
leaves a digital trace

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,799
someone read the file opened the file

31
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,920
got into the network opened a certain

32
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,040
port a certain site did something else

33
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,360
and the traces are

34
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,200
there and we're going to work with

35
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,680
digital traces

36
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,760
however this information

37
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,200
[Music]

38
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,159
is

39
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,439
abundant

40
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,320
we have too much data and it's very well

41
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,759
that you know the time slot and specific

42
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,000
person but when you have a lot of data

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,240
you need search tools the first

44
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,600
classical

45
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,399
tool is search by attribute

46
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,399
what is an attribute something external

47
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,038
name extension

48
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,080
maybe

49
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,599
the channel

50
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,250
the time

51
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,440
[Music]

52
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,480
this is something external to the file

53
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,200
pluses it works fast faster than any

54
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,959
other tools

55
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,640
but it works only with external factors

56
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,760
second

57
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,640
search by content when

58
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,800
you want to look at the contents what is

59
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,440
inside you get insights

60
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,440
um

61
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,360
when you found something by attributes

62
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,040
it will be easier for you to see the

63
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,040
contents

64
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,480
and it's

65
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,480
good that

66
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,560
you have a document and you can get the

67
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,800
information but sometimes you cannot get

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,840
it

69
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,200
say images we have ocr

70
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,319
when you get text out of

71
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,239
the image

72
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,640
the technology is not new

73
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,720
but engines do change

74
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,000
and we have to patch our engine

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,480
each time and he works better and better

76
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,200
no user

77
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,239
text out of it then what are we going to

78
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,440
search for and we're going to use

79
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,400
glossaries and regular expressions when

80
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,200
you understand approximately what we're

81
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,239
going to get regular expressions

82
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,920
something we're going to take for

83
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,879
example files which are called rd

84
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,159
asterisk asterisk

85
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,360
dot

86
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,000
and three more

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,560
symbols

88
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,280
what do we have now

89
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,280
neuro networks without going to much

90
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,480
detail

91
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,080
neural networks

92
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,720
uh something that we can teach

93
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,040
for example we taught our neural

94
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,480
networks uh to discover

95
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,680
passports russian passports passports of

96
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,918
the russian video federation for example

97
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,120
we have 100 images

98
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,000
uh

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,600
80 of them are cats but 10 are

100
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,880
passports

101
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,800
and the neural network

102
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,759
can get it for example your stamps

103
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,479
and something else how does it work for

104
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,960
example

105
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,479
so we have screenshots and we can see

106
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,160
that there are some traces a certain

107
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,680
employee sent a file out of the company

108
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,120
he copied it

109
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,560
on

110
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,840
usb

111
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,880
key

112
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,520
he connected it to some other computers

113
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,280
and that will help us to investigate

114
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,759
then attribute search

115
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,919
this is how it looks like

116
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:08,720
we

117
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,080
set up conditions

118
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,880
and a thousand files

119
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,680
are

120
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,600
monitored and

121
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,800
we find

122
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,600
four

123
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,800
files

124
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,160
with appropriate attributes that we set

125
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,440
up

126
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,600
something was printed something was

127
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,440
copied and we optimized our work in a to

128
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,479
a great extent search by text

129
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,800
we can have glossary for example the

130
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,680
word directory

131
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,400
director

132
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,160
and we found the words keywords

133
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,479
and even a picture with a certain text

134
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,520
with the same word and ocr sees that

135
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,479
this is a picture about the director

136
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,600
that is more or less clear now let us

137
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,800
make it more complex what do we need we

138
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,960
have to understand what

139
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,680
did the person do or

140
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,600
did not do

141
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,680
with his pc so

142
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,600
maybe

143
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
in action

144
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,000
is also important

145
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,319
what can help us

146
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,440
all information

147
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,520
it contains meta data

148
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,880
something

149
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,639
was done

150
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,080
or the person worked from home from

151
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,039
office from somewhere else now it will

152
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,440
be more clear a bit later what else

153
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,800
besides metadata the information as such

154
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,400
a person

155
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,680
read certain texts processed certain

156
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,800
letters

157
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,319
opened a certain site

158
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,880
read or sent it something events

159
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,400
he logged in locally remotely uh

160
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,039
successful authorization unsuccessful

161
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,759
authorization we know to have to know

162
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,400
all those facts all those events i'll

163
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,479
show you a specific example when a

164
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,560
person connected

165
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,039
locally

166
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,680
on the weekend

167
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,319
and that is a big question why

168
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,360
not remotely but locally from the office

169
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,680
on his day off

170
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,720
then

171
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,160
a person

172
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,199
in the office worked with files deleted

173
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,560
them sent them somewhere what he did and

174
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,880
what he did not

175
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,840
the first point is the working day what

176
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,639
happened we can take the snapshot of his

177
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,800
working day and see that at a certain

178
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,599
point he worked with this application

179
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,039
at this site

180
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,160
uh it may be important and useful for

181
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,440
example a letter was sent that certain

182
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,759
actions have to be taken urgently and

183
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,720
the person said i didn't get the letter

184
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,479
and we say no

185
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,960
you opened this letter

186
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,360
and the person said i didn't know oh

187
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,680
really he wasn't present in the office

188
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,400
on that day he really didn't know

189
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,199
or

190
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,000
a person deleted the file

191
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
and in the system

192
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,840
we see yes

193
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,400
the fact is here the file was deleted

194
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,800
an interesting incident

195
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,479
about

196
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,479
file transfer

197
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,880
interaction with competitors

198
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,159
mail channel or site

199
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,320
channel and we see that a letter was

200
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,760
sent

201
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,760
with a certain text

202
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,760
with addresses

203
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,560
search by attributes is interesting here

204
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,959
and we see the fact of

205
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,480
file transfer

206
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,760
to the competition

207
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,880
site visits

208
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,959
for example people

209
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,440
sell

210
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,440
enterprise

211
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,800
and you can see the screenshots

212
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,240
passports

213
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,920
i told you

214
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,839
in the data flow

215
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,360
we see the passports personal data

216
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,440
was transmitted

217
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,560
to somebody else and neural networks do

218
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,600
it

219
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,720
very quickly credit card number

220
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,519
uh

221
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,600
with 16 digits in a row and the control

222
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,839
sum

223
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,830
and you can really find such

224
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:42,959
[Music]

225
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,160
data streams very easily what else

226
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,640
do we have to do

227
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,720
what does the person do at his workplace

228
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,440
so there are three points discipline

229
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,519
activity and productivity we have to

230
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,560
know

231
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,079
security people and managers when did

232
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,480
the person start working when did he

233
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,880
finish working

234
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,519
while at work what did he actually do

235
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,920
did he really work

236
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,519
was it useful to business

237
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,079
this is for hr this is needed for

238
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,160
security people because this is a good

239
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,160
argument for communication with the

240
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,720
person if he has a person if he has a

241
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,000
problem uh if he has to be pressurized

242
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,160
somehow

243
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,240
so you may have a question there are

244
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,839
different people

245
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:36,880
yes

246
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,519
there are different people and there are

247
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,079
some persons where you can control

248
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,560
discipline

249
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,120
lawyers who must be at the right place

250
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,519
at the right time and there are sales

251
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,320
people and the main thing is the result

252
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,440
and we shouldn't control his office time

253
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,399
but he the results of his operations

254
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,640
what he did what he sent what he

255
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,760
received

256
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,519
so

257
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,000
time discipline is not applicable to

258
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,680
sales people

259
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,839
there were some talk managers who

260
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,519
sometimes

261
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,519
manage

262
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,120
the companies very well but

263
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,240
sometimes he watches football matches

264
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,600
during his office hours and it's also

265
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,399
interesting to realize whether the

266
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,760
manager works or entertains himself and

267
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,040
there are different layers of

268
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,760
information information for top managers

269
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,519
midterm managers rank and file users

270
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,680
and users from different departments

271
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,640
the owner and top manager should have

272
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,959
access to all information other people

273
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,360
not to all of them

274
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,720
so this is the office time and you can

275
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,680
see and analyze it

276
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,600
and a remote person said he worked for

277
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,000
eight hours a day

278
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,240
and we said

279
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,160
5.5

280
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,680
hours youtube the rest of the time he

281
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,200
was working

282
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,079
then you can

283
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,920
guess the future

284
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,000
when a person

285
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,639
leaves the company he starts thinking

286
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,720
about leaving the companies before he

287
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,760
leaves

288
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,839
so the person

289
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,440
starts looking for a new job discusses

290
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,399
that with his colleagues and it helps us

291
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,160
to identify the event before the event

292
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,639
happens

293
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,839
so it's in imp also important to see the

294
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,000
atmosphere in the

295
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,880
group

296
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,000
for example when the top manager

297
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,200
issued

298
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,760
took a decision which was not popular at

299
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,560
all and people started discussing it

300
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,639
with his peers

301
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,480
in whatsapp

302
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,600
and it was important to know what they

303
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,079
really think about

304
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,519
the company

305
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,399
why

306
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,760
you need that

307
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,440
because very often a person uh when he

308
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,560
is leaving the company he realizes that

309
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,880
what he did that he believes that what

310
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,680
he did in the company is his property or

311
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,600
her property

312
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,760
regardless of when he did it

313
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,040
during office time or not he deletes a

314
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,399
lot of files he copies a lot of file

315
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,399
and some people say that i'm going to

316
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,920
take everything i have a

317
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,079
usb

318
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:44,880
key

319
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,800
two terabytes

320
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,639
i am going to copy everything here maybe

321
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,040
it will be useful at my new

322
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,399
uh office in my new company so it's

323
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,519
interesting to see that pam d cap are

324
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,160
two good systems that can help you for

325
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,160
example when a person looks for a new

326
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,760
job our

327
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,040
virtual

328
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,599
employee

329
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,120
what she did

330
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,120
in order to try to find a new job

331
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,440
once we had a problem that a person

332
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,680
started looking for a job but

333
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,440
she was acquitted because she was

334
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,360
looking actually for a job for her

335
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,519
husband not for herself

336
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,360
and we proved that

337
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,040
it was all right

338
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,920
so file tags

339
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,120
and we can see where the file is is the

340
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,480
file in your company or did it leak out

341
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,040
of the company so we can check if the

342
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,519
file left the perimeter of your company

343
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,560
is beyond the perimeter or not sometimes

344
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,839
is the file being prepared for leaking

345
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,720
now we can also find this

346
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,399
before the event happens

347
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,279
we

348
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,320
see information in the computer when the

349
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,880
information should not be there

350
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,920
and

351
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,959
there is an alert to us we want to see

352
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,680
now why what is happening

353
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,000
then emotions regular expressions also

354
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,880
will help us to see the real mood the

355
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,399
atmosphere in the company

356
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,600
site visits

357
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,920
also important all these examples are

358
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,120
from real life what else can we do what

359
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,440
else could be useful

360
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,959
for example we can trace a violation of

361
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,160
i.t rules

362
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,399
which

363
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,759
improve

364
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:46,560
the

365
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,680
health of your company for example

366
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,040
inventory

367
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,319
of hardware and software

368
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,240
someone can take out

369
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,880
a usb connected device and insert

370
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,240
another one

371
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,800
in one company

372
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,320
without

373
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,519
internet he came in with his phone

374
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,880
and started going out

375
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,600
to the internet through his phone

376
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,839
and the system showed us

377
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,680
and

378
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,959
it showed us that the person

379
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,600
got access to wi-fi

380
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,680
which was not allowed to do

381
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,040
remote management also is important to

382
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,040
see what is happening

383
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,199
at a certain workstation

384
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,399
anomalies i.t anomalies on a regular

385
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,759
basis

386
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,320
uh we find

387
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,360
such a way things that antivirus doesn't

388
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,759
say anything fireball doesn't say

389
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,199
anything however

390
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,199
we see enormous activity

391
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,640
you can block external devices if any

392
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,559
you can have black lists and white lists

393
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,599
and of course forensics with an asterisk

394
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,039
why

395
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,520
forensic is forensics is a science about

396
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,280
investigation of it

397
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,160
if someone comes in and forensic person

398
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,480
comes in or you yourself carry out

399
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,959
investigation and you need to look at

400
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,799
the logs

401
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:29,840
i

402
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,679
i know it requires a lot of time but

403
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,840
if you come to your computer and the

404
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,559
computer already collected

405
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,880
all the data beforehand

406
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,520
thanks god you

407
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,760
have all the data you can start working

408
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,559
at once for example violation of i.t

409
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,960
rules

410
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:52,960
in one

411
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,200
computer

412
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,400
gibb was launched escape was launched

413
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,280
and uh well

414
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,640
you know that some um anomalous activity

415
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,280
will take place

416
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,840
in the other case you see local events

417
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,000
that shouldn't have happened in one

418
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,240
organization

419
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,880
they saw

420
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,400
their passwords

421
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,200
and

422
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,840
mapped it to

423
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,760
the dictionary of 100

424
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,480
passwords

425
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,400
and

426
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,880
we find out i have a password one two

427
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,360
three four five

428
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,400
why

429
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,520
hm

430
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,440
so it makes people work properly

431
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,559
so inventory hardware and software

432
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,080
a disk for

433
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,480
480

434
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,559
gigabytes was

435
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,760
has disappeared why

436
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,320
maybe it was stolen maybe it was just

437
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,039
disconnected why it's interesting it

438
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,320
requires investigation

439
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,679
let's have a look why a person did that

440
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:10,720
why

441
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,919
he needs a certain application

442
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,120
remote management and administering

443
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,640
wi-fi connection which appeared

444
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,080
all of a sudden

445
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,520
anomalies on average a person in one

446
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,320
department

447
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,918
takes

448
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,679
certain actions

449
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,120
for a certain time and we have tens of

450
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,640
thousands of events of a certain kind

451
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,559
and with one

452
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,600
person one employee you have 100 000

453
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,039
events why

454
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,760
so there is a boat a boat which operates

455
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,559
it was not discovered by the firewall

456
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,600
and only by anomalous behavior we

457
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,280
discovered it

458
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,080
blocking external devices blacklists

459
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,840
white lisks

460
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,840
total

461
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,919
blocking

462
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,559
or if

463
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,679
during a certain time you copied more

464
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,280
than a certain amount of megabytes

465
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,919
everything could be blocked what else

466
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,640
has to be taken care of look at this

467
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,120
slide and realize

468
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,240
what is going to happen

469
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,840
uh how

470
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,240
much

471
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,480
operation

472
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,960
will cost so don't look at the cost of

473
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,280
the license but what about

474
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,400
operation

475
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,440
cost

476
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,919
you will need a specialist you will need

477
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,480
to operate it for several years three

478
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,520
years five years how much

479
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,400
it will cost you per year

480
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,440
and then for five years

481
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,039
someone

482
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,400
sends you a link

483
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,360
and say

484
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,960
just

485
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,600
open it and see what happens so you can

486
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,280
of course

487
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,720
play with all those blocks but please

488
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,919
if you install anything which delays

489
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,159
business operations that will be bad

490
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,120
your

491
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,919
security system should not impede your

492
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,799
normal business it should be

493
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:27,679
non-invasive

494
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,360
money is important

495
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,159
so your equipment your

496
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,640
hardware and software should not prevent

497
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,280
business from earning the money

498
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,159
what else there are some organization

499
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,200
that

500
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,159
have

501
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,360
to use

502
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,480
certified solutions only

503
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,159
and which are in the register of

504
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,760
a local russian-based software so

505
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,480
look at your solutions are they

506
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,000
in on that register or not look at the

507
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,760
technologies

508
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,880
we didn't

509
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,720
we prepare for certain events

510
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,000
but we preferred independent things

511
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,960
which do not require extra

512
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,159
expensive we use ubuntu we use astra

513
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,679
linux operating systems

514
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,760
we want to be

515
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,440
as independent as possible

516
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,159
so and workstations

517
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,200
those who worked with windows alone

518
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,000
well

519
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,240
they have to

520
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,799
shift to other operating systems then

521
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,799
what kind of operating systems it's a

522
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,039
good question

523
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,600
so i told you about the tools now a few

524
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,039
words about the product stuff cop

525
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,960
