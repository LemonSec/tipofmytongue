1
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,540
thought this guy sounds like me

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:10,200
any pictures me his name was Josh
Blackie any said hey I'm gonna make

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,759
leave on Josh lacking so he got up phone
and he's calling

4
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,090
AT&T as just let he who is the head of
support

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:21,869
anything head is Josh listen up I heard
that there's some competition going on

6
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:22,730
at that time

7
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,949
and we need to make sure all over
systems are secure what OS are you using

8
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:27,699
what your antivirus

9
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:31,320
what your PDF reader in these guys are
like just here it is here it is here it

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:31,640
is

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,520
so he actually ends up calling someone
who knows Josh personally

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,289
so this by text jostle says just some
guy just called you but I know it's not

13
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:41,079
your voice

14
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:44,260
what do you do it and Josh

15
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,320
is two doors down in depth on

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,280
no joke at another speech and he says

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,739
that not me and he comes out me comes in
the room is for big guys and he's like

18
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:59,039
who say in their jobs lackey up setting
up unlike

19
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,900
the guy in the booth

20
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,350
the other is just take her I ends up
being a great picture

21
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:09,350
he's like they had to take a picture
together and say in a you know this is

22
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,090
like this

23
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,270
and he was really cool about it really
cool but at first I was like what you're

24
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,510
doing you know you're calling people
they can leave me

25
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:19,140
there's a little a little crazy as a
really great story so in the end this

26
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,690
day we had that happen

27
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:24,470
and then I love it if you guys listen to
Infected Mushroom we got social engineer

28
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,860
away and backstage in effect mushroom
culture

29
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,080
and hang out with those guys are pull
your nothing to do with the date at all

30
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,290
I just put into this fall okay now we
want to

31
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:39,410
taking another step further so we did
you know we did news

32
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:42,479
a all-news then we did experience versus
news

33
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,070
then we did men versus women and now we
want to do this

34
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:50,570
a true the deadly so social engineer and
we again wanted to have

35
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:54,460
a men versus women competition

36
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,970
but on a different level like we were
going to match experienced men

37
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:03,030
against experience when and
inexperienced man

38
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,090
against inexperience women again to see
if the data

39
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,130
would correlate on any different and
this year was our first female winner

40
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,959
up this social engineered capture the
flag even though the previous year

41
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,450
as a whole the women scored more points
we never had one

42
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,920
we never had a woman when this year was
our first female winner for the

43
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,700
competition

44
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,920
she didn't just win guys she killed us

45
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,319
like 500 point difference in between her
and the next person underneath her

46
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,920
she like obliterated you ever hear this
researcher call any cutting

47
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,170
any cutting she does a whole thing on
body language

48
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,530
talks about power posing she talked
about doing like the Wonder Woman

49
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,030
stanchion you do this for two minutes

50
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,790
you have high confidence that like that
so she's in the back to the room

51
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,000
standing like this and I'm like

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,150
is free you know initiatives in the
booth and she just

53
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,780
wipes the floor with everybody and she
was phenomenal she was really really

54
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,420
phenomenal

55
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,660
so what we learn from this well again
the data

56
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,750
showed us that you sympathy and
assistance teams

57
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,069
sympathy and assistance things what most
women used

58
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:08,170
that people were very willing to give
over all sorts of information

59
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,190
at work much better than authority based
themes

60
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,200
so saying things like

61
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,170
I'll hey listen on the head of IT and we
got a breach

62
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:22,250
and I need to get all this information
from you worked not as good

63
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,540
as if you said paying my boss is making
me work early

64
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,340
and that really stinks and I you know
overtime when I get home to like it

65
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:35,790
maybe you can help me out the survey at
to take and people would fall for that a

66
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,520
lot easier

67
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,560
so we we saw that work amazingly well
this year we also did something

68
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,640
different we had a kid

69
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,110
competition I i mean a huge Twitter

70
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:50,959
wonder so I had this idea that we had a
kid social engineering competition and

71
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,170
they could make phone calls with the
kids in the fall

72
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,450
so that's all ciphers and puzzles and
and things like that

73
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,530
and the last competition they're putting
together something called the Scilly Co

74
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,850
thats piece of paper wrapped around a to

75
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:07,180
that spells at a site for a net solve
the cipher and I wanna have

76
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,400
somebody shooting them with a nerf rifle
while they were doing this

77
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,800
thinking it would be fun for the kids so
I tweeted if there's any snipers out

78
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,750
there that want to shoot kids in Vegas

79
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,660
the enemy yeah that was a few bright I
got me some attention I was looking for

80
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,020
but we got these two guys and answered
so we set them up but these are

81
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,500
with these nerve rifles and they got to
shoot children with their

82
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,020
starts while they were doing this this
thing it was all other social

83
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,360
engineering up there's nothing to do
with the data here

84
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,410
but again a really fun part love the SEC

85
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,400
yet part in the data but that was just
kinda educating children

86
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,160
and how critical thinking skills are
very very important we're gonna tie that

87
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,160
back in a second

88
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,690
%uh one other thing that happened in
this Dept of it is adept at 21

89
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,830
as we had the chance to work with Apollo
Robbins

90
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,930
anyone no apollo all got the gentleman
thief

91
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,470
he does the pick pocketing I think
picked people pocket you can watch

92
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,479
videos on YouTube is truly amazing

93
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:06,740
like he just walked up to a complete
stranger I'll take your watch of

94
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,990
take your time even though it's gone and
we had income and

95
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,430
that come with it a big speech together
and on

96
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,530
we were talking about this topic how
social engineering is such a big threat

97
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,640
and why in person social engineering is
so dangerous

98
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,339
and what we can do to defend against it
and bringing awareness

99
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:28,069
to the average person on things like in
person scams

100
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:31,860
pop pickpocketing and things like that
he brought a guy up on the stage

101
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,779
and literally took his watch often as
well as pocket without him knowing

102
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:38,949
you know the guy was fully aware he's
like I'm gonna do this

103
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:42,300
and you're not gonna know he's like no
you won't be that has watching it was

104
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:42,599
like

105
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:45,909
I was standing right there watching and
couldn't believe what I saw. and it was

106
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:46,639
a very good

107
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,669
very good speed matter fact are
something really amazing happened that

108
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:51,149
this

109
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:54,589
a there was a a good friend of apollo
that heard

110
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:59,019
that we were doing this speech together
he wanted to come hear us do this speech

111
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:00,169
for a movie he was an

112
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:03,869
so we got a chance to hang out and me
Will Smith which was really cool

113
00:06:03,869 --> 00:06:07,110
a because he was interested in social
engineer to

114
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,159
how does all this type back and what
does that have to do with anything

115
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:14,399
well the the aspects of social
engineering that were important for this

116
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:14,939
year

117
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:18,669
we're trying to look at how it affects
each of us individually

118
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:23,689
because not every person responded
sympathy not every person responded to

119
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:24,449
authority

120
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:29,300
but each company again was compromised
by the end of the day

121
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:34,479
the report again showed how much social
engineering was not being fixed

122
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,469
and we kept looking at the data and
saying well what can we do to fix it

123
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:41,729
and the only answer was critical
thinking and education

124
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:45,219
with the only things that could
potentially face social engineering

125
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:48,579
or help people be aware and defend
against

126
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:52,300
so last year his name

127
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,409
we want to do something that we've never
done

128
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:58,939
I really honestly thought this was gonna
fail miserably

129
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:02,009
and it was packed teens so what we did

130
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:05,659
is weak we we've got teens to people and
they had to go

131
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:10,050
in the booth at the same time and they
had to tag out

132
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,209
which meant that while you're on the
call with target

133
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:17,349
you have to come up with an excuse a
pretest to say

134
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:21,829
you're gonna speak to my partner right I
mean not think about if you ever wanna

135
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:22,539
call

136
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:26,229
with like your cell phone vendor and you
called support and they said

137
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:29,649
hold on I'm gonna transfer you the truth
over here

138
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:33,939
what at the a little autonomy a little
frustrated and they had to do it back

139
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:35,100
and forth

140
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,100
at least three times during the call we
were trying to make it so that

141
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,410
we would fail and the companies would
succeed

142
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:46,200
that we were trying to do ride we would
fail to succeed

143
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:51,200
and we chose retail this was our our
theme for this year's retail

144
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,580
we want to have like all the big
companies that

145
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:58,920
that were that Americans use every day
they go to shop at every day to see if

146
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,820
this was a big big problem well

147
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,050
talk about that a minute that's a weird
picture me negro

148
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:11,280
okay so here's what we had this was a a
this was are both to people in it

149
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,410
at all times and had to come up with a
pre-tax now

150
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,890
think about what kinda pretext you would
use that this was you

151
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:21,100
there was a couple that we heard that
were really really fascinating

152
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,920
here's one on one one guy who had

153
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,080
a a friend of his in the booth with him
it was a

154
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,190
as a man and a woman team he said that
he was training her

155
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,070
in tech support so they were going to

156
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:39,380
transfer back and forth for training
purposes

157
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,570
and the woman 04 trashed for

158
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:46,540
another team I'll actually the person on
the phone

159
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,100
recognized number that they were calling
from was not the corporate number

160
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,720
so she said hey the number you're
calling from is not corporate if you're

161
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,050
calling them support lies at the
corporate number

162
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:00,330
and he said lol calling with my
teammates and we're using Adobe Connect

163
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:04,580
so that's why the number looks different

164
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,430
she went up okay she fell for right
every time

165
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:11,730
an excuse was given it was accepted

166
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,370
as as an acceptable excuse I was in I
literally I was amazed

167
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:19,610
I do this for a living and I was sitting
there going wise is working

168
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:24,300
no one stopping them and we had to
analyze this piece the data very closely

169
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,280
so what we found is that

170
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,420
people humans we want to fill in the
gaps

171
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:34,030
for others we want to not have people
feel bad or embarrassed

172
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:37,800
that's human nature so when someone says
something that doesn't quite make sense

173
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,680
to us

174
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,240
we we end up filling in those gaps

175
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,830
give you a story we were doing a
penetration test our goal was to get

176
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,360
through the front door

177
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,490
and I had to get through security and
security was a woman at the front desk

178
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:56,459
and I had to drop USB keys and the USB
keys we just have a little being in that

179
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:56,800
would

180
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,439
paying home know now we're on it would
just tell someone put in

181
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:05,029
and the USB keys were in white envelopes
and the endless to be marked something

182
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:05,529
like

183
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:09,170
employee bonuses on you know salary

184
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:12,449
information things like that to get
people's interest we want to see if

185
00:10:12,449 --> 00:10:13,629
anyone would put that in

186
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:16,910
and on the and looked to be a sticker
that says if you find this please return

187
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,189
it

188
00:10:17,189 --> 00:10:21,209
HR so we hope that they wouldn't do it
of walking up to the front

189
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:25,610
the front door and I see this guy he
pulls a little BMW went on to the

190
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,920
parking slots it's a

191
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,850
BP you know like the CEO love those guys
and he's on a cell phone

192
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,139
really angry a it seem fuckin seem far
away

193
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:38,029
standing outside his partners gesturing
like this and I get up close

194
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:42,040
on a hearsay I really don't want to do
this I'm really upset I don't want to do

195
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,490
this

196
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,649
I don't know what he's talking about I
can see that is physically upset

197
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:50,199
so I walk in the front door the woman
sitting at the front desk hurt her

198
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:53,829
monitors just turn up like to see the
reflection in the window

199
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:58,119
she turned just as happy to help you and
literally this cannot be plant

200
00:10:58,119 --> 00:11:01,769
this was not planned had no clue this
was gonna happen but I saw

201
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:04,910
figured let me try to use it she was
playing minesweeper

202
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:09,269
on her computer at work right so I see
it and I listened

203
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:13,269
pay you don't know me bunnies Paul that
your boss is outside

204
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:17,230
he's really upset that he walks in and
sees that on your screen

205
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:20,519
that may want to shut it down she
clicked the X on it

206
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:23,689
and he comes in he does best in my
office

207
00:11:23,689 --> 00:11:27,420
and she walked into his office she
turned around she melts to me

208
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,249
okay likes and I'm like army

209
00:11:31,249 --> 00:11:34,399
money that will happen there's enough so
I week

210
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,549
people are coming up a can I help you
might not know that she's coming out a

211
00:11:37,549 --> 00:11:38,689
way out shortly

212
00:11:38,689 --> 00:11:42,910
so I way I way away that comes out and
she goes where were we

213
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,759
and I said oh you were just about to
give me a badge in let me in for my

214
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:47,230
meeting

215
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:52,299
HR and she paused and she looked at me

216
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:55,699
thinking I can almost see interface this

217
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:59,759
we weren't there and then she side

218
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,899
okay she had me in that would be

219
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:05,230
in now later on okay so we got and the
whole

220
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:08,720
companies compromise everything was bad
for them I came back for the report

221
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,190
meeting

222
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:13,269
and I pasture I said you you knew that I
wasn't

223
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:16,420
we were there right because inside as
you can see I knew

224
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,589
said why did you let me in she just she
was so nice you see

225
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:23,949
me from being embarrassed and I felt
like I owed you

226
00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:28,329
see how that works it was fascinating
for me asserted that look at adding okay

227
00:12:28,329 --> 00:12:31,339
so she knew her head her brain was
saying

228
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:35,130
this guy we weren't there no he didn't
we were in at that point

229
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:38,759
and and yet she still let me through the
door

230
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:42,370
because I was nice and I saved her from
embarrassment

231
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,440
and that's the way we work right that's
the way we work up here

232
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,029
she didn't she felt obligated to me the
sensible obligation it's a principle

233
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:51,139
influence

234
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:54,630
other senses obligation to give me a
gift back

235
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,870
because I gave her a gift first and that
gift was

236
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:02,170
a compromiser for company so pretty
serious we start to look at this

237
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:06,449
same principle with this year and the
CTS started to say what

238
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:10,930
is working and it is because anytime
someone used to compliments

239
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:14,069
or some type obligatory statement making
them feel

240
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:17,569
obligated to the to the to the social
engineers

241
00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:20,779
the person on the phone gave over
information

242
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:24,889
ignore the fact that the sometimes the
excuses make no sense

243
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:28,630
I'll what one CAI actually said on the
phone

244
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:32,439
the ladies that happen your numbers not
from corporate and

245
00:13:32,439 --> 00:13:35,610
she said on the diaphone

246
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,910
%uh the social engineering. he said all
other Picasa

247
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:43,199
are calling from my cell phone because
our corporate line is having problems

248
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,970
was no no joke is accused the women okay

249
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,600
in a minute later he's got a transfer to
his partner

250
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,850
so he says or what have you talked to
forget whether I would have you talked

251
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:55,470
to Mary

252
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:59,569
and the woman says way but if you're
calling yourself or how much talking to

253
00:13:59,569 --> 00:14:00,160
merit

254
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:06,140
he goes well three-way calling she goes
okay

255
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,520
you no don't say okay I feel like
picking up the phone lol

256
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,100
roads a no hang up which it did she fell
4

257
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,720
be excused makes sense she didn't want
to embarrass the sky

258
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,400
fascinating but data really really
fascinating but

259
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,740
data the room was packed to the whole
time we could really couldn't believe

260
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,870
how exciting

261
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:29,230
it was for this that past year because
how much

262
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:32,380
interest there was in social engineer so
yesterday

263
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,880
I asked I walked around and I asked just
people I've never met before

264
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,090
in russia if you think that social
engineering

265
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:45,170
is more of a threat or network hacking
as more of a threat

266
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:50,010
so let's let's do this year as a rule if
you think that network acting as well

267
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,970
%uh there's no right or wrong answer
okay so just

268
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:56,010
vote how you like but this time
everybody about K this half you to sit

269
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:56,820
near McKinley

270
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,280
understanding so if you think network
acting

271
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,580
is more of a serious problem to
corporate culture

272
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:08,770
measurement k good sizable now

273
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:13,130
and now you think social engineering is
more problem to corporate culture

274
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:16,550
raise your hands and this is what I
often see

275
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:20,520
so now think about this and I really
would love to have this discussion was

276
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:25,450
love you ninety percent of us that boded
put her hand up for social engineering

277
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:29,830
if we all believe it and we agree that
this is the biggest problem

278
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:33,850
why are we not fixing it why is it not
getting any better

279
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:38,110
why is it that were six years into a
social engineering competition

280
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:42,570
that happens the same month every year
were calling almost the same companies

281
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:43,410
every year

282
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:48,220
and it's working the same every year and
I'm doing this for a living

283
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,620
we're doing and fishing and fishing and
break-ins for a living in we're using

284
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,960
the most ridiculous pre-tax

285
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,680
ever and it's working why is it still
working

286
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,500
that's the question we really have to
start analyzing an answering

287
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:07,070
because ninety percent of us here are
voting that social engineering

288
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,210
is the biggest problem and many of us
are

289
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:14,300
where were right about this but how how
do we fix it well we started to

290
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,830
have a different type a room after the
competition so we had to CTF

291
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:22,560
last year was the first year we had
speeches and the room so we had National

292
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,740
Deaf contract and we invite people into
speak on topics

293
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,750
that we hope will educate the masses on
social engineer

294
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,840
so we had some people you may or may not
know this change mystery

295
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,250
he doesn't really interesting work
actually travels the globe

296
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,980
and he has done a break in job so paid
for

297
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,060
social engineering impersonation all
over the globe all over the Middle East

298
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,450
America you're up all over the place and

299
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,630
to the to the left here your left is
Michelle

300
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:55,020
venture she works with me she's a she's
a field trained

301
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,100
psychologist and she understands how
humans think

302
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,970
she talked about influence kevin Mitnick
very famous social engineer we invite

303
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:03,650
him in

304
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:07,870
talk about how he did his attacks back
in the day

305
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:11,360
demo it's a really interesting things
this is David Kennedy the creator of

306
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,010
said

307
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:17,470
I social engineer talk he talked about
why he created that Howell has helped

308
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,830
educate the masses of how easy it is to
do things like fishing

309
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:25,280
and payload delivery through email and
we invited these people in

310
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,370
with the hope that what we would do is
bring more polite

311
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:32,140
to the need for education because how do
you fix social engineer

312
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:36,490
is not a plug right I can't give you a
patch that you plug into your network

313
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,820
and it always protects you

314
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,290
from fishing sup possible is it how many
of your

315
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,820
a I work for big companies how many
youths your marketing departments and

316
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:44,990
%uh

317
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:48,780
emails that look just like fish right to
give us

318
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,620
I mean I don't know about you but I see
it all the time working with HR

319
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,810
marketing departments

320
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:56,330
and their emails look just like phishing
emails and they're not but they look

321
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,060
just like it

322
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,170
I many times to legitimate phone calls
come in

323
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:03,440
but you don't know if they're legit they
sound like fishing calls

324
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,430
and how many you have policy you're not
supposed to let someone into the door

325
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,780
lets you see their badge

326
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:14,520
but how many times have you seen people
let anyone and I got a really good

327
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,170
friend

328
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:19,700

and she was all supposed to take this to
the server room and I i you know it's

339
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:48,880
just so heavy and

340
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,559
these guys take the box they bring her

shut the door and to have a good day

344
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,429
letter in the server room pay so she
says

345
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:08,880
this is genius she gave birth to the
baby I then she goes on Amazon

346
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,169
she buys a fake baby bump a Styrofoam
baby but right guys we're screwed we can

347
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:15,260
do this doesn't work

348
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:18,440
a truck no I didn't and it right and
intra at

349
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,090
no I'm not wearing out by the way so at
which she bought a fake baby bump it's

350
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:23,960
terrible

351
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,710
she puts like USB keys and a laptop up
in the air

352
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:31,549
when she walks into a building capital
pregnant should contain

353
00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:34,909
me amazed don't do that okay

354
00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:38,299
but it's just when you look at these
things about how

355
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:43,100
easy it is how do you fix that you can't
there's no patter popular software

356
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,950
you can't now put a sign up any pregnant
women need to be inspected

357
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,000
can't do that right so how do you do it
well

358
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,130
education education is the only X for
social engineer

359
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:58,620
there's no way that we could possibly
fix I'll def on 23 that this year

360
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:03,010
10 divisions come and find out a way for
the report gonna be a big big year for

361
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:03,490
us

362
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:08,450
because we've been doing this for five
years and then we've also been doing it

363
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:11,039
from a corporate level for about that
long to

364
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:15,529
where we've been fishing and fishing and
doing impersonation attacks on companies

365
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:19,340
for five years we've been looking at
this data and saying

366
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,799
well really can't education possibly fix
it

367
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,500
so here some things that we did
unfortunately we couldn't do for the CTF

368
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,669
but here's how to work for us

369
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:34,000
is we would take a company that would
say has a hundred thousand employees

370
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,980
and we would fish all of their employees
once a month

371
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:42,320
and then we would educate them so we
would send him a phishing email

372
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,860
and then we will educate them on what
fishing is and what they could have done

373
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,519
to catch that he met

374
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:51,309
we set up proper reporting methods so
the how

375
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:55,600
where they should report phishing emails
and what to do when they see it

376
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,190
like don't click don't forward it to
your friends no job guys this is another

377
00:20:59,190 --> 00:20:59,789
story

378
00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:04,010
we had an email that we sent a phishing
email with the payload on it and its it

379
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,510
was really simple it was something like

380
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:09,450
we need you to open up this account
payable she please open it and let us

381
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:09,970
know

382
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:13,730
if you have any problems so they had a
shell

383
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:18,429
had a matter for the river shell click
got a shell than a minute later

384
00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:21,470
we see another shell from the same thing
and then

385
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:25,450
10 minutes later two more shells and
then half an hour later

386
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,610
two more shells were like what's
happening why are there so many shells

387
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:29,870
from the same payload

388
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,880
well what happen is when they first
person couldn't open it

389
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,210
she forwarded it to her friend at the
next few

390
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,929
and picking you up in it he couldn't
open it so he forwarded

391
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:43,260
to the HR department they double click
the three times

392
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,299
they couldn't open it so they forwarded
to the IT department

393
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:49,580
in the eye guy tried to open up three
different machines

394
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:54,710
so shells all over the network and it
was because they forwarded so we tell we

395
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:57,519
educate people to top forward fish

396
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:00,779
this is a bad thing so what's the
results okay

397
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:04,389
years a fishing people and educating
them how does that work

398
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:08,450
well we saw in this 1 company and tell
you a seventy percent reduction

399
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:11,710
seventy percent reduction and the amount
of

400
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:15,590
actual now we're related incidents due
to fishing

401
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:20,019
seventy percent reduction so education
seems to be on that works because

402
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:21,200
patches were doing it

403
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,840
antivirus I love it I love it tell you
my favorite I see the Boosters disperse

404
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,120
yellow Kaspersky

405
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,409
but it's a management tool it's not a
security tool right

406
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:34,289
it's only gonna save you from viruses
with known signatures

407
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:37,750
what about 20 days what about the brand
new

408
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,620
a virus or malware that just came out
yesterday

409
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,010
or just came out this afternoon it's
hitting your corporate network no

410
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,960
antivirus can save you from that

411
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,600
know what no you know what if there but
if they're using the systems that

412
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,080
hide their shellcode inside other
programs

413
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,400
not gonna get saved from using a
management tool

414
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,210
education is the only thing internal
pretext we learn this

415
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:04,230
this is a huge huge thing when you have
an internal project manager coming from

416
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:07,090
HR you're coming from it. you're coming
from

417
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:11,490
some other department with in the
company that works amazing

418
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:15,160
people really fell for that quite quite
a lot

419
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,840
well other things we learnt women are
scary

420
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:23,080
weather really scary guy I mean it they
look all pretty and nice but they're

421
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,730
scary

422
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:27,980
and they're really really good social
engineer they're just Naturals

423
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:33,890
had it I'll we have rules and I think
that from a corporate level

424
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:37,960
if you decide to get into social
engineering as a as a career path

425
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,050
but I think the rules should maintain
their

426
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:45,620
one thing I was standing by my employees
is that we need to think like the bad

427
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,790
guys but remember that we're the good
guys

428
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:51,780
so we have to have the capacity to think
like we're one of the bad guys but

429
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,740
always remember that we're here to help

430
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,430
so we don't want to ever use
embarrassment shame fear humiliation

431
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:01,750
those things have no place in the
corporate environment for education

432
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,910
and this one 37 hand us

433
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:08,160
this one team bass hand at all 30

434
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,540
seven times and 30 minutes 0 I'd

435
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,900
I set up a rule that I thought was gonna
make it impossible

436
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,990
I thought that it was gonna make it like
we were gonna fail a social engineers

437
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:22,610
and 37 handoffs and 30 minutes that's
like

438
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:26,150
averaging more than $1 a minute
unbelievable it was his will is gone

439
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,640
back and forth between the two

440
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,680
and the person on the phone never even
never even noticed

441
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,580
and posting your passwords in in like
the little help documents guys

442
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:37,900
that's a bad idea I know it seems like
common sense but I feel like I should

443
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,760
bring it up because

444
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,530
last year forgot to say this we found
that also another

445
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:45,740
login page with a real working museum

446
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:49,630
password and help document so you know
if you're working for a big company

447
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:55,110
will make sure that your passwords to
honor so this is our themes that we had

448
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,010
so far

449
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:59,240
and depth on 23 who knows what we're
gonna do

450

some time questioning about seven or

453
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,360
eight minutes

454
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,700
left the question so if anybody has any
questions is it the about this topic

455
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,890
anything do social engineer if you don't
I'm

456
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:22,080
see and no

457
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:31,640
list or call of people just like you
here we are gonna here

458
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,270
could you think you'll or I

459
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:37,720
for very simple question you're set

460
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,390
but it's also engineered in their oath
because we are human

461
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:44,980
if the should a struggle with

462
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:49,809
so stones and %um the became more and
more on human

463
00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:54,710
a example promo of part to

464
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:58,410
you know capture and so he

465
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:01,860
human and at least three time that day

466
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,270
I try to prove to robot but I'ma human

467
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:08,400
if so engineer not be ok

468
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,870
created equal became inhuman yeah I
understand your point

469
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:16,990
it's a valid point because I get asked
this do we want to encourage people to

470
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:19,620
become less human to fight social
engineer

471
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:24,500
the answer is No a hundred percent No we
don't want to be terrible communicators

472
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,080
we don't want to lack trust

473
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,309
lack report building just the fight
social engineer

474
00:26:29,309 --> 00:26:32,440
that is not the case I'll give you an
example if I can to help

475
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,140
with fishing people see how do you fly
fishing well usually

476
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:39,790
we do for our customers as we set up on
the Internet

477
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:44,600
a color of the day so not something like
yellow blue it has to be something

478
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,010
really ridiculous like

479
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:49,960
she foam creation you know something
like that everyday changes

480
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,880
now I call you and I say hey I'm poll
from HR wanna get your

481
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,240
government ID number in your date of
birth and you say hey Paul what's the

482
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,280
color of the day

483
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,860
II didn't check this morning oh can you
go check right now real quick

484
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:05,090
and and you know that I'll answer your
question I can get my copy of you when

485
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,340
you get it call me back

486
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:10,520
and now what I've done is they've taken
the need for you to not be human

487
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:14,220
and to think out of the equation and
that made it so now you can just

488
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:18,960
put all the onus on me to have to prove
to you that I'm the person I say a

489
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,750
and that helps with keeping you her
human

490
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:26,960
but also protecting you from an attack
vector know that's a really good

491
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,500
question no we definitely don't want
budget paranoid people walking around

492
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,020
either

493
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,510
imagine that how the companies would be
if they were free to talk to anyone

494
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:38,160
no are you really from a journey start
Asian people would be terrible cell

495
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,480
but I want that

496
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,490
other questions yes over here

497
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:49,850
when I think this guy job thank you very
much for us

498
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:54,340
Beach E it's amazing it's very inspiring
out well

499
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,900
my question is I you said your arm

500
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,610
you're making been trashing test social
dancing

501
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:05,470
contrition best and doesn't walk das
accompanies

502
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:09,880
become all are protected from softram

503
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,320
injuring attacks and that's a really
good question so

504
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,470
five years ago when I started we would
be baking people to do fishing

505
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:21,120
or vision and now in the last year and a
half for two

506
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,070
people are calling us and they're saying
we want to do fishing and fishing and

507
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,010
impersonation

508
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:29,270
as part of our pen test because there
seems that

509
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:33,140
yes of course getting pretty hard to
crack and then we got really good

510
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,440
Packers I'm sure someone sitting right
in this room some of the best actors in

511
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,680
the world come from russia

512
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,260
reading some of the most amazing 0 days
right just releases

513
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:46,790
mind-blowing but it take you fifty or
sixty or seventy or 100 hours to write

514
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:50,290
that exploit but I can get and by making
two phone calls

515
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:53,730
well where are we right you're gonna be
right next 10 min and the two phone

516
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:54,130
calls

517
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:57,570
and companies are realizing we don't
protect against as we're protecting

518
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:58,250
against the

519
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:02,510
the viruses and malware and the Trojans
and we got idea systems and packet

520
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:06,270
inspection an antivirus we have fire was
coming out the years but

521
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:10,060
no one knows how to do it recognizes
fish so it is becoming a lot more

522
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:10,700
prevalent

523
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,980
for people to to use penetration testing
in america

524
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:17,520
now and I can't speak on russia i'd I
don't know if that's the case

525
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,740
up we do a little bit work in Japan I
can tell you that Japan's about 5

526
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,740
years behind America where

527
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,580
we are with security in the social
engineering sense very advanced

528
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,480
technologically

529
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,380
when it comes to social engineering
japan is still a very very trusting

530
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:36,720
culture are they haven't yet picked up
the idea that social engineering is a

531
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,420
real threat

532
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:41,770
great question yes sir

533
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:51,160
gonna make you run

534
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,960
are uses it on your social engineer

535
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,000
City your targets a US companies

536
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,590
but also says that you're working to
earn I think in some other countries

537
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:05,700
is that the big difference for New York
another congressman

538
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,770
and blows on the company understands
that as a doc is some foreigners

539
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:13,750
maybe is a more cautious or the just the

540
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:17,000
because they are so some of your own
state's yeah I'll

541
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,120
that's a really good question so I'll
tell you from the russian perspective we

542
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:20,490
did

543
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:24,760
fishing campaign for company in Russia
and we fished russians

544
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,170
and I had a appoint a contact here that
help me translate and you

545
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:32,690
the Russian language and my first email
was very

546
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:36,230
American amazing sale this and then they
were like okay

547
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:39,740
calm down there you know your way too
excited Russia not even smile

548
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:43,490
like no its not been so happy and I was
like really come on let's go to work and

549
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:43,880
they're like

550
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,920
no it's not and they they started
editing the email

551
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,270
so it was less America no american we

552
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:53,890
make everything being you know it's
amazing it's wonderful escalation were

553
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:57,620
exploration work in their alike just
chill out smiling boy so

554
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:01,250
we did we chilled out and we brought it
down at work and that was a big lesson

555
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,730
for me because the next month

556
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:07,010
I did a phishing campaign in Turkey and
they have a whole different culture

557
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:11,650
then in Russia and we had to start
thinking about the cultural differences

558
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:14,780
where we go in Japan they speak very
close to you

559
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:18,520
right they get like Brighton right here
when they talk to you and America

560
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:22,560
we kinda do this if you get too close
and that route in Japan so they get very

561
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,660
close to you and you have to just how to
deal with it so we go to Japan to do

562
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,170
work

563
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:29,730
you have to just realized that
ultraviolet B the social engineering a

564
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:30,580
different culture

565
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:34,190
I have to accept your clothes are not
have you accept my so

566
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:38,250
if I'm gonna social engineer here I
would have to calm down my big words and

567
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,160
a smile

568
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,320
try to the you know different that I and
a whole

569
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,420
in Japan I have to let them get really
close you know talk a little quieter

570
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:50,120
really loud Japan like walking to a room
and i talk like me

571
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,230
and everyone turns around like that

572
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:57,330
know it's a terrible so budget chill out
a little that can help

573
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:00,900
that's a good question cultural
differences do need to be considered

574
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:05,690
because that will be the effect on if
your first building report not

575
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,799
and then people start to ignore your
little States

576
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:13,040

600
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,380
this poor guy

601
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,720
I

602
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,630
hi is at least sale how do you do

603
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:47,490
a socialist Neil of a some ID management

604
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:50,680
orals say all securities

605
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,570
there's from a good point you mean or
for actual work

606
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:58,990
that you mean you mean like to get the
sale or do you need to

607
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:02,820
do it as part of a contest a sunburn

608
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:07,410
and this not come on people but or

609
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:10,919
security officer all or idea Minister

610
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:15,480
yeah that's a good question so because
we always assume that security guys tend

611
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,100
to be

612
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:20,350
more in tune with our attack vectors so
we think that they're going to be better

613
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:20,860
at

614
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:25,560
at combating us but here's what I found:
if I come in with ego suspension

615
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,780
so I turned them down low and outlet and
the super smart

616
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:32,250
then that works with IT managers really
good you know like if I

617
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:35,669
by come in with the phone call itself
the from HR

618
00:34:35,669 --> 00:34:40,890
not intern hey this is Paul and calling
for major at a higher last week's I'm

619
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:43,480
really sorry I'm not following the
proper procedure but

620
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:48,159
are healthcare database it just got
washed because at some

621
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,220
Obamacare thing I mean element just in
college I don't even know what's going

622
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:52,760
on here

623
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,380
and and they just told me to call all
these people that have a red flag that's

624
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:56,929
the name

625
00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:01,610
i'm suppose to verify your details so
have your name down as Michael

626
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:06,290
thats MI chal Zara Smith as an IT agents
but OK

627
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:10,780
have your social security number down as
1,2,3,4,5,6,7

628
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:14,740
that's not right whom so glad we got
that because you know I don't know what

629
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,760
happened to your health care

630
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,520
within and then the correct you but if I
come in and say hey listen I work for

631
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,390
the Boston answer my questions they're
like the IT guy to shut up your account

632
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:24,010
now

633
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:27,820
you know i'll settle that doesn't work
but if I come in with ego suspension

634
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:32,080
it seems to work much better with the
guys who feel that there are more power

635
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:40,440
in the company you know others

636
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:40,869
that

637
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:46,510
is getting a workout for today hello

638
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:50,859
bracing for you missing talk are like to
know if our social engineering actually

639
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:54,080
holes all the time like to people
getting you to think some stuff

640
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:58,010
I'll that's a great question well could
have another hour I think another hour

641
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:01,800
understanding the hope that a that's a
wonderful question so

642
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:07,050
we started to look at social engineering
for as far back issue man writing goes

643
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:11,270
so you look at things like if you're
Iran I'm not sure a lot to talk about a

644
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,000
taboo topic but if you look back

645
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,240
like in a Bible books in Genesis there's
a a big social engineering aspects

646
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,560
between a I Isaac and and his father

647
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,260
are Jacob and his father there the
Trojan horse if you go back to greek

648
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:24,790
times

649
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:28,220
if you go back to con man back in Roman
times

650
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:31,720
and you look at all these principles up
free texting

651
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,640
and falling a person into thinking
you're something you're not

652
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,630
there are almost identical to today but
what evolves as the technology

653
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:44,240
so to do you think about it picture last
week the same thing he did to convince

654
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,000
eight people to buy the Brooklyn Bridge

655
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,710
is the same exact things that we're
doing to fall for fishing

656
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:54,320
or phishing emails right now but the
difference is if you look at dire wolf

657
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,690
they have call centers over 100 people
running

658
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:01,100
phishing scams on innocence all over the
globe

659
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:05,830
out to get their banking information so
the technology evolved to make social

660
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:07,130
engineering easier

661
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:09,880
and and don't raise your hands on this
but think about this how many have you

662
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,380
have

663
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:13,609
Twitter LinkedIn and Facebook accounts
just those three

664
00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:17,570
I have to okay but think about what
happens here you have twitter

665
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:21,040
I'll let you at least 10 I know where
you went to college where you work and

666
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,050
where you ever watch

667
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:24,790
I know the group that you're in the
things that you like and some other

668
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:25,550
friends you have

669
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:29,390
if you're on Facebook I know where you
go on vacation I know your girlfriend's

670
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,700
name I know your kids names I know your
family

671
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:35,230
I know your friends there I know music
you like the concert you go to the food

672
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:35,790
you eat

673
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:39,440
and if you use Twitter and your
Foursquare I know where you're at every

674
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,810
second the day when you checking in at
the coffee shop when you're working out

675
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:46,290
when you're driving to work when you
trying to picture the sunset when you

676
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:49,410
tweet and Russia you don't have the
crazy car accident

677
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:52,220
put all over the internet you know these
whacked out meteors in the earth and

678
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:55,079
stuff ready so you have I know all those
things about you

679
00:37:55,079 --> 00:38:00,309
I can profile you psychologically like a
profile you psychologically based on

680
00:38:00,309 --> 00:38:01,849
just three social media things

681
00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:05,269
so a social engineering has not involved

682
00:38:05,269 --> 00:38:09,220
but what has evolved the technology so
it makes it easier to

683
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,839
to profile you as a person yeah while

684
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:17,109
like the whole another hour for that
other wonderful question I'd be happy to

685
00:38:17,109 --> 00:38:18,049
discuss that

686
00:38:18,049 --> 00:38:22,049
outside in the hallway or something even
more so where make picked up now

687
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:25,380
