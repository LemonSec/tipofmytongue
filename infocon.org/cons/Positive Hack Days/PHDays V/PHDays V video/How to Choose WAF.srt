1
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:04,259
law

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:07,569
Irish excited well

3
00:00:07,569 --> 00:00:10,929
from the bottom of some be rid of

4
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:15,219
I am dealing with her well security law
of

5
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:18,270
applications and also in Tulsa

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,580
by may get there were no getting my

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,250
master degree and I'll talk about to
office

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,890
what is the problem at all customers
always approach

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,010
often approach us to I ask for
protection for their

10
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:36,590
web applications but the most to a prop

11
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,830
at protection for things like ABS now
and

12
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:45,110
wife saw the next generation robs looks
more promising the problem is there are

13
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,070
too many of them

14
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:50,130
and each of them is based on some a
special ideology and

15
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,700
some specific cities in terms of
integration in do infrastructure

16
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:59,740
and some special requirements for their
stuff

17
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:04,330
training and now I'd like to look at

18
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:08,510
laps from the point of view of for
protection

19
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,610
offer web applications

20
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,590
laugh miss to have

21
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,040
6 protection mechanisms to guarantee

22
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:26,350
data security for web applications some
of them are simple like care protocol

23
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,110
checks and

24
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:31,450
some others are more complex like here
there

25
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,470
mom

26
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,160
machine education I will

27
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:44,080
point out some of them for you too more
less understand how laugh

28
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,810
a gives you protection and know what to
look for star some very basic things

29
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,050
like protocol

30
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:54,990
no I'm verification it serves as

31
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,610
the limiting factor because it narrows

32
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,920
p area the for

33
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,360
in Tudor like Arab sorry to see check

34
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,660
or it to home

35
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,150
limits the number of parameters and the
length of parameters

36
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,110
so that no Meriton

37
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,490
enquiries look legal it also that also

38
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:23,340
checks I'll mmm for time parameters

39
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,650
in the finally for looking it looks for
illegal by its

40
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,890
the next be lineup protection

41
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,190
is blacklisting in the form of
signatures

42
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:40,020
signature is quite an old protection

43
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,620
Medford in the lab context is still

44
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,750
irrelevant the chromosome Weber
applications which

45
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,420
arm modern and which abolished

46
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,700
no and now are very subject to attacks

47
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,800
and

48
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,290
its actually beneficial thing laugh

49
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:05,310
for our can nom my is it has the
mechanism of

50
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,569
for Lannan model

51
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:11,519
building and ok

52
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,040
who where from gives you protection when
the

53
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,530
example mmm him model is not yet built

54
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,670
and it can also a fact the teaching
process and makes it more

55
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,500
clean if you compare different vendors

56
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:35,870
signature analysis you keel you see the
difference in the number of signatures

57
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,420
you can also a local at

58
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,150
know whether this culture is a scene or
is it is hidden

59
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,200
and also some vendors

60
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,040
maybe produce signature as a correlation
rules

61
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,430
the someone vulnerabilities even
well-known

62
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,659
I'm not always effectively fount

63
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:02,260
with just one signature it takes some
more them

64
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,260
sophisticated security policy which
takes into account the frequency of

65
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,109
occurrence

66
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:11,400
but the meaning of the headings there
angel IP addresses and other things

67
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,569
up to remove from blacklists

68
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:18,829
said moved from black lace

69
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:23,949
a on him more reliable Linux their
foreign beer

70
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:28,080
machine learning there are the different
performance

71
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:36,150
up the axis and the Gators there's the
Adlon model

72
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,570
and all the help in this has occurred
but to the model is thrown out as the

73
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,310
illegal

74
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:43,780
so it's gonna profiling

75
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,770
to compare different vendors im

76
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,630
it's hard to compare two different
reason because

77
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,100
the mathematical algorithm this
adjustable album is closest to publish

78
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,160
so that's why we cannot resurgent

79
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,370
misidentification away second problem is
that

80
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:04,000
old framework a lab research

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,270
there's never an can never get enough
light traffic because webs

82
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,660
they are existing in their real intent
with real threats

83
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,590
however we can estimate here to tools
like this

84
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,620
first me setting up the

85
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,040
parameters a machine learning and the
and objectives and look at two

86
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,110
and the actual benders some I offer very

87
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,770
precise tuning for example weekend goes
up the

88
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,720
and miss stardoll learning we can
highlight certain a prancer

89
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,270
ranges protested a for the

90
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:43,570
testing zone and so on other than urs
could never can I mean provide their

91
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:47,390
unprofor's apart from that duration at
the spirit and this is what should be

92
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,760
prepared for when you make

93
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,480
choice optimization the standard model
works

94
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,450
as the protection mechanism from the and
learning at the machine when the app

95
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:00,800
was changed by the developer I which
often happens during the cycle

96
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,860
development

97
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,920
in the Mile strides to Paul's nificant
the

98
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,240
the optimizer aggregates in according to
special commission there

99
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,940
a be up he's been sent to be learning so
by default

100
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:19,380
every hour the object

101
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,400
was found probably small zing and
there's

102
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,730
need to we learn we teach the object

103
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,000
we've seen slides

104
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,020
should

105
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,410
start when we built the army into our
standard model

106
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:41,030
and see the condition when we consider
it done

107
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,370
the next to word

108
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:49,110
protection SR user grows the serb
quieter setting

109
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,710
the point is that the operator about
them

110
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:57,230
up good

111
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:01,170
the applied level is down at things
validation par saying because

112
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,310
administrator probably

113
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,410
want something up his own a pen tester
tester

114
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,820
split the access to Web ABZ and so on
and so forth

115
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:14,370
and he is thinking how we should be able
to

116
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:19,320
and use others rules for internal so
what would give those opportunities only

117
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,290
two internal mechanism but I'll City

118
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:25,120
administrators the tool

119
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,750
here would compare two approaches on the
sly

120
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,650
there's solutions by two vendors this
solution at the same tests the

121
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,550
protection a web app from phasing

122
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:39,750
in one case 8 it can be a simple
correlation rules a certain criteria in

123
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,690
the second case

124
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:45,770
it's a simple its bold and programming
language so he can do whatever he wanted

125
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,580
so each would shoes

126
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,900
anything he wants depending on the
qualification his wishes

127
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,020
at the client's wishes so

128
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,460
if there's a ranger certain

129
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,020
details in the stuff would be able to

130
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,860
in I'll work on that its were choosing
the programming language but if

131
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,300
the the be administrator but he is not
qualified never needs to reckon certain

132
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,090
aspects

133
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,640
Danny be better to choose coordination
rules

134
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,810
other Remy criteria the next protection
too I would not say that it said

135
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:26,810
a must but the it's interesting the
context of

136
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,700
of bring in because

137
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:36,270
good

138
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,490
web suggests

139
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:41,090
earn the sky never service

140
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:45,080
at the first mechanism that's built in
many websites but mitigation

141
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,610
where size response her in there is
there just had written to the web app

142
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,370
which according to certain parameters
identifies whether they're this machine

143
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:56,230
has been infected or not so if machine
is infected

144
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,890
then probably good their

145
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:03,140
query that too came to it was the
partner their activity

146
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:07,620
a botnet and a scam javaScript can cut
off from the latter but that's when the

147
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,680
attack which bleed decrease efficiency

148
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,459
Mar

149
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:14,139
also their ass and dick needs to

150
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:18,070
word each had to de-ice but it's more
interesting to check out the

151
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,810
reaction said and the ways to

152
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,949
in which you wept reacts at the a pile
of course versus

153
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:29,069
bring forth charge perhaps other BS
heard this term according to the big 12

154
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,500
a column when

155
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,949
the machine at express its opinion about
the

156
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:39,209
by the transaction's legal or not must
a.m. the

157
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:43,470
the old sis improve work into its
opinion to guarantee that the machine

158
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,009
has been

159
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:48,959
spending resources so when our website
is under attack we

160
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,139
build n at this a task

161
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:55,639
into each piece onto the web app and
hence

162
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:58,850
a slowing down the source in making each
client

163
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:02,410
spend a certain amount of time to solve
learn

164
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:06,310
the task that we sent him if the
solution is wrong then we throughout

165
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,230
this kinda query

166
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,370
but as a rule if it's a real machine if
it's a browser

167
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:15,410
it will spend some time in just the
right response cell is kinda slow down

168
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,329
the source he reached his light on the
source

169
00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:21,209
next mechanism is captured challenge
everybody knows this session is unable

170
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:22,209
to capture

171
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:27,060
and it's it's identified the human one
and shaping leggings and its level

172
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,680
we again you said line to every user
which job exited

173
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,720
and lasting here which is in bed and
wipes

174
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,050
its the integration overall life

175
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:42,310
is mourns protection data protection too
must be very well integrated into the

176
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,500
general landscape that's that increases
its efficiency

177
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,279
any efficiency entirely IT security
enterprise here it's important to

178
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,620
integrate into

179
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,530
them bowler body scanner and you realize
they were told build hashing function

180
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:58,750
be about medigap dates you upon our
abilities

181
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:03,670
is important to integrate quickly with
cesium systems

182
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,529
and

183
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:08,600
and another possible integration with
their natives activities in mind to

184
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,220
bring

185
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,680
web DB correlation and also

186
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,550
the modern trains like reputation
service service and

187
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,160
and fraud prevention services this is
where I would

188
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,839
probably finish my presentation for
today no need to worry

189
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,100
keep calm cheese you up so in a thing or
dial up to ask

190
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,500
a to show is show certain mile two
things at told you about this is the

191
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,440
the iceberg when I first address the
question

192
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,399
no above the one choice I made this huge
list

193
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:46,510
criteria where I put into NHA can all
those details to

194
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:50,490
the compare these products on more
academic bases in our

195
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,660
when new people we propose come to our
company we

196
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,890
get into this beautiful model I have the
