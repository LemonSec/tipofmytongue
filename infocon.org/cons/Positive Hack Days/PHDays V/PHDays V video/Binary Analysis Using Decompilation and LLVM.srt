1
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,429
good afternoon a.m. welcome to

2
00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:10,980
presentation on binary analysis the

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,780
and

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,429
the compilation

5
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:20,660
I'm LLVM mock

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,179
I ma here are some pics on urban the
knapsack he will help me

7
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:29,970
will should tell about to the yet

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,040
using this by neurons announcement
compilation using the

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,649
different languages and how we ended up
there we are a small team of a

10
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:44,010
developers from moscow focusing on some

11
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,070
certain types of solutions and

12
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,869
back your back over backwards
engineering

13
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:54,089
added we'd we're doing that

14
00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:59,379
for about 10 years good

15
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:04,089
and would like to share some mojo
development in the afforded

16
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:08,240
over the next 20 minutes or so

17
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,539
right now we are working acts on us that
this can all

18
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,720
statistical analyzer for programs
written

19
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:22,219
you know with the sea and the c plus
plus and the main solutions that want to

20
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:23,520
see in our analyzer

21
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,560
are listed here on the screen first of
all the analyzer must

22
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:37,530
support popular statistical analysis
methods

23
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,600
such as template-based

24
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:46,740
search for liabilities and different
types of data flow analysis

25
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,290
banker taint

26
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,320
analysis and more komplex

27
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,740
things for more sophisticated diagnosis

28
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,430
we analyze all must also have

29
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,700
for and a scalable database

30
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,520
because the databases the heart all

31
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,340
well I analyzer and without a big and

32
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,750
expandable database said he it will be
of little use

33
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,480
or also as one of the

34
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,989
key features of the analyzer is a

35
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:28,269
by phone made the Kapa'a

36
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:31,650
I force for scripting

37
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,510
cuz the main functionality of the
analyzer is

38
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:41,280
boot outside

39
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,740
good

40
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,930
good

41
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:49,650
to use this functionality in scripts so
that a group aligned analysts will be

42
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,610
able to write new rules

43
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,570
without trouble and without pain and I
as a designer

44
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:59,150
as a developer can now focus on on the

45
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,260
developing the engine

46
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:09,740
of the analyzer this is more or less how
it happens

47
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,810
no will some reservations this
arrangement

48
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,690
is sir true for most of the statistical

49
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,270
checkers met you can find on the market

50
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:23,360
so a the entry

51
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,180
use have the CMC's him to see

52
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,780
mine which show program and the

53
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,110
then we have for some kind of a such a
model that

54
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:41,670
see is them a uses sod

55
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:48,680
be determined rules sense group woohoo
as you may have guessed to use the

56
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,960
only a mile I'm Corinne we

57
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,180
already had and still having

58
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,900
experience working with this library
this is why we've

59
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,250
we decided it's good for

60
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,260
this kind of task she was about to say

61
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,630
lol the amount is positioned as at mean

62
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:13,070
set of technologies to develop com

63
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:17,200
completion utilities its era include Sir
Paul fold

64
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,219
language in with the liberal license

65
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:26,190
you know so based on the early on

66
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,320
%uh them many popular front ends which
are built

67
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,480
are on top man with that CSS blues
objective-c clam

68
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:40,080
is one of them also as an example

69
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,720
good there's a dead

70
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,460
compiler that uses the goal and a rusted

71
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,390
by the way congratulations with her
roster Elise

72
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:58,210
good so as long awaited

73
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:01,570
in this way using one of the existing
from tens with Cam

74
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,890
yes have some already make

75
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:09,800
a ready-made in internal representation
and because

76
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,970
such analysis will be a star based on
the cell VM

77
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,620
we can use as a front-end any

78
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:22,420
good compiler that

79
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,720
will give your and programa model in

80
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,160
LVM terms for example you can

81
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,530
take Microsoft you like and do with some
reservations

82
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:37,060
almost immediately how at in c-sharp

83
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:44,120
II language analyzer good

84
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,789
still as you analyze some programs

85
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:51,090
you find that they are linked

86
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,240
pony nor any information systems use

87
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,789
components or my programs about the
source code

88
00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:01,669
such as libraries or X execute all files
especially

89
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:09,139
Eileen new window platform part of

90
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:12,479
apart from that it could be legacy
components with

91
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,039
I lost the source code or a modified
malware

92
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:21,250
my binary type in order to process such
cases

93
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:25,599
we came up with this idea and to use CD
comp

94
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:29,599
the combination method to build internal
representation

95
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:33,009
well p.m. more for subsequent analysis

96
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:38,699
sensual with this approach

97
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:42,289
the the arrangement will not

98
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:45,830
changed much to there's only one

99
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:57,160
I new front and that translates the
binary code

100
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,400
the main problems that he will face

101
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,560
when do the compilation no one other
problems that you face Ian Nadu in

102
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,370
compilation is it a lot of for loss of
data

103
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,780
the winner no you or

104
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:15,729
or we if it will not done properly and
the program in

105
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:19,430
level you may lose program subprograms

106
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:24,199
the variables and a by classes of data
and

107
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:28,720
linger links good

108
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,930
means CP blasts and it is not to
normalize

109
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,510
No

110
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:38,629
cold and the mmm

111
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:41,379
depending on the comp I only use the

112
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:44,669
or the 10 the way you to you on the

113
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:47,819
environment in the result can be
different

114
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:50,849
if you do the programming for Android

115
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:54,359
in cancer know that it it is a one bite

116
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:58,609
for Windows two bites I'm level in exits

117
00:07:58,609 --> 00:08:01,859
for mites just one example

118
00:08:01,859 --> 00:08:06,389
very simple and also

119
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:14,760
you binary file can be back packed

120
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,379
should

121
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:17,850
tool

122
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,650
take taking all these problems with
tried to come up with a

123
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:26,940
ideas that are very desirable

124
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,130
at Decompiler level like with any and
I'll be in front end

125
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,460
we want to come relation to be done

126
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:41,289
automatically another option would be
interactive

127
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:45,010
for interaction with the user but to
this is not

128
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:50,360
priority right now another

129
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,870
listen to Fisher own the compiler is

130
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:58,340
to be able to generate in maximum
quality year

131
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:03,050
04 outboard I'll explain why it is
important

132
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,130
good there are some decisions already

133
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:09,450
existing to translate binary files

134
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,930
in to allow the AM but unlike the

135
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:17,330
the unlike our solution dole's
translators

136
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:21,720
do

137
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,260
do the translation from the source
problem into some microcode to written

138
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:31,460
in LLVM terms good

139
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:36,650
to the purpose of such an slater's is so
called binary translation

140
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:40,570
we tried that approach we had one
project that

141
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:44,680
we we implemented something similar and
be

142
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,100
outcome was but

143
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,370
to we do need to high-level all

144
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:56,220
for and this analysis

145
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,310
hang on other hand I'm along for
sensuality

146
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,370
so we our requirement

147
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,740
more the compiler is as much as possible
to

148
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,830
restore the source programs and some
programs

149
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:12,250
and as well as data types some barrels

150
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,840
so essentially what we're looking for is

151
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,420
earn a out report which can be
comparable to

152
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,850
those of front and over Albion on

153
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:30,819
cranks and other terms

154
00:10:30,819 --> 00:10:32,910
also really realized

155
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:37,139
the support of high-level structures
over

156
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:41,649
to see last language formation of

157
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:48,269
on Baltimore process and exception
handling Zed

158
00:10:48,269 --> 00:10:51,920
similar to statistical analyzes the
decomp I'll are suppose

159
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,220
Texas dental database and

160
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,769
tries to unpack hand-picked by know if
I'll

161
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:02,860
if needed

162
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:09,100
no go through all the operate
operational that Decompiler least as it

163
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:09,600
is

164
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,240
same fermented in our case the first
phase we

165
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,250
restore the CFG programs

166
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,420
trying to isolate the

167
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:25,710
yet

168
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,270
the data we use

169
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:32,380
the algorithm

170
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,529
said mum

171
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:36,720
algorithms a typical there compiler

172
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,790
based on the part from rationally his
signature

173
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:44,200
search good like a slow dance

174
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,340
the

175
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:50,680
do some other steps after

176
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,590
restoring safety problems and all the
other steps things are better

177
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,330
we launch analysis of the data flow

178
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:03,640
based on the representation that we get

179
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,460
and after that we have the a source

180
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,940
programs and variables restored we're
mmm

181
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:15,410
looking for global parables not

182
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:20,410
on everywhere that in all the places
that was a recognized as data

183
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:24,790
based on the restore their goals we
launch the process of restoring data

184
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,380
types

185
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:30,000
for each an instruction puts some

186
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,180
limitation on the types over memory

187
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,490
objects that will be used so we can the

188
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:42,660
you some mild

189
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,950
setup equations and then sold them

190
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:49,320
so if the memory area

191
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,840
can be both

192
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,530
a.m. a pointer and value

193
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:01,160
and use the pointer is is the

194
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,000
process on the compilation restores both
structural and basic types most

195
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,860
importantly

196
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,000
mmm local areas

197
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,840
are restored but when they come to that
later

198
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,970
in a the last stage as we can

199
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,650
based on the presentation resulting from
that we generate

200
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:26,260
LBM and and the resulting LVM

201
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,910
is simplified for better readability
particularly

202
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:33,220
deletes the and dead cold and

203
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,460
if possible my we

204
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:42,519
move the memory on ships into the air
registered

205
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:44,719
also based on the ramp

206
00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:47,719
they are that is the

207
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:52,889
results from that we can and distinguish
between functions and a

208
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:56,459
no CFG regions

209
00:13:56,459 --> 00:14:00,649
want there's a cycles and Nakano

210
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:05,199
condition and others it's hard to see
what's

211
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:10,859
Cartwright's her to see what's written
the code I'll try to spell it out can

212
00:14:10,859 --> 00:14:12,979
you see a guy said

213
00:14:12,979 --> 00:14:16,719
creche looks like you can

214
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:22,939
so as an example like show small PC
software it's unlimited

215
00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:27,499
it's simple one overall there's a mine
function

216
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:32,789
there's local but massive and in

217
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:36,169
any a sequence to

218
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:39,829
the buff with the ester CPA will recall
word

219
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:44,729
argumentative Rd one after that

220
00:14:44,729 --> 00:14:48,410
it would keep get different function

221
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:51,250
so obviously the National software
contains

222
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:55,040
to the facts would

223
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,800
this is the air City PI call for the
user supply

224
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:07,010
and the print call he nails in the floor
for a line we use user-supplied data

225
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:11,550
on the right you can see

226
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:14,690
a hissy and

227
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:18,860
the the image that we got it it's a
result to the compilation

228
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:23,170
to compile East yes

229
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:27,070
as a comparison i I show you a one show
you that Clank

230
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,779
generation by the same posts be software

231
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:34,990
so the one on the right to both
democrats similar

232
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:39,730
and can be compared quality course we
lost the

233
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,890
titles with arrivals though

234
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:47,980
so the big cock epic got we analyze with
ours

235
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,560
statistic analyser did

236
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,890
and for the claim forget the same
results and find the range upon our

237
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:56,640
abilities

238
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:03,840
here's the example of Hearts is supposed
to be working

239
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:13,000
get to the end she based lock

240
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,630
would and see the argue argument

241
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:23,720
and be the chain abusers we get to the
caller pastor si PI

242
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,319
saying weighing

243
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:33,779
same thing with their local but for and
the statistical

244
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:38,509
analyzer will work on the car I will
find the vulnerabilities

245
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:42,800
such as their fill the buffer for
example your filter paper

246
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,860
she technical details try to be quick

247
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,689
so the architectures that are supported
by now I

248
00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:55,220
the 666 in work could

249
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,829
we support three most

250
00:16:58,829 --> 00:17:03,339
popular images and the knowledge base
includes

251
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:09,579
store chips standard libraries in NP I
of

252
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:15,699
the popular operating systems so the
possible ways to use the two compilers

253
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:20,659
in addition to statistic analyzes is for
example binary transmission

254
00:17:20,659 --> 00:17:25,579
for example the thing they just showed
you

255
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:30,220
basin example they just showed you
compiled

256
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,590
4mm arm Android after that I launched on
my tablet

257
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:40,100
works just because the software is
correct

258
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,620
can also transmit the jobs for for the
happened

259
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:47,110
two-line scripture of course would

260
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:51,030
generally that's not always possible but
that's the point that

261
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:57,490
that is there and this can be used in
their work to generate these can

262
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,430
algorithms

263
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:02,100
but also can use are tools for classic
the completion

264
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,390
for example essentially

265
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:09,860
when he tried other back and that bull

266
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,270
probably and their pool display beer

267
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:17,140
pseudocode and of course the crap
display at the software you saw it

268
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:23,490
sometimes it's easier to use needs more
communities it did said support

269
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:27,559
of course not always the compilation can
be built correctly we done correctly

270
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:30,720
sell mostly I

271
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,870
when we transmit there are some
inconsistencies and errors or

272
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:39,040
the subcommand just not execute a part
of the code or not identified

273
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,610
I dakotas code however during the
analyzer

274
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,920
binary vulnerabilities often

275
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:51,210
it's quite not to support the partial
transmission the initial

276
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:57,110
image and essentially we were able to
you transmit departed the software

277
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:00,800
which contained that the fact

278
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,149
we did with their sufficient quality
when the founder

279
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:07,200
peace to the car with on our ability so
it's a win

280
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,780
so that's why we support both

281
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:15,720
partial analyzes and partial
transmission the code

282
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,750
in addition where the dedication
signatures

283
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:23,150
at the vulnerable components the south
which are used to search for

284
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:37,980
vulnerabilities just mmm by signature
the components

285
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,880
this is it

286
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,370
thank you very much if you are
interested in to come play Shin please

287
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:48,059
pitted two links the be lowered to write

288
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:54,049
we have recently the a published the
source code of our other Decompiler so

289
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:55,720
it's open it's available

290
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:10,120
thank you for listening

291
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,330
up three can't hear the question sorry

292
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:27,270
car to translate it

293
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,570
questions the following

294
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:33,080
at this image on lapd this is the LBM
and to the right it's your generation

295
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:33,410
right

296
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:37,559
Sedona turn it on the left you got the
this the status export

297
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:41,190
which was on the the source code and the
right in the battery

298
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:55,370
Korea and binary yes exactly thank you
very much

299
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:58,500
two questions for stool as if I can I P
supports the

300
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,250
modification at the changes there'll be
a modification or delay sadistic

301
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:07,190
static analyzers ASX so far only static
allies but

302
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:14,429
data VM has I think getting and nothing
stops you from genuine Italian right

303
00:21:14,429 --> 00:21:14,960
there

304
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,900
another question in do you plan to you
or is there perhaps the

305
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,809
the possibility to to our decompile
object file which were denied by GCC or

306
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:24,950
Visual Studio

307
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:29,390
and the allies so those things so is it
possible are you going to produce that

308
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:33,799
yeah I we you've been thinking about it
then we're going to go dead end

309
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:37,010
not because we need for some other
objectives some

310
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:40,700
generally there's no significant
difference here the

311
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,270
between the gyro between this staying
and the transition at the

312
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:53,350
binary that we have no

313
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:58,370
a more questions up

314
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:01,560
I there

315
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,970
so we talk about sadistic analyzes this
is this error this israeli product or

316
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,250
it's still a work in progress

317
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,630
for the static analyzers is

318
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:13,520
is there's a separate static analyzer
without the bridge without the compiling

319
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,330
yes we have the analyzer which a person
but code

320
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:22,260
LOVE ME code such commercial product
that can be bought

321
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:29,130
and you sort still in development its
stern development and I believe the

322
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:35,560
we will of course the chillin n to
develop sold to ask you for a demo

323
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,550
version

324
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:50,130
now it's too soon for that my do
