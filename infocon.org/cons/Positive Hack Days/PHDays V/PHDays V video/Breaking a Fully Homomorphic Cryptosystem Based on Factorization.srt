1
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:16,779
my

2
00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:20,740
which is and

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,230
in this I would like present

4
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,400
one recent

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,970
up system are

6
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:36,180
and first I would like to make a should
introduction

7
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,530
into few somewhat Republican

8
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,580
I'm it is oh well known

9
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,760
that on usually give this is the most
hyped

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,340
private data by transformant

11
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,910
into a hundred willful and how much look
at the system

12
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:59,680
this on some additional important
property they are

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,570
Los %uh to computer arm functions and

14
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:08,299
problems I'll up in trip today ok result

15
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:11,869
involved in up decryption key

16
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:15,100
be are endo the December

17
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,329
result of competition other clinton's

18
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:21,409
over maybe a extract

19
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:25,899
I'll from there is all the competitions
other subjects

20
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:29,030
by the owner or secret key ok if the
system

21
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,319
and a.m.

22
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,799
here the most important single

23
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:39,420
is Oklahoma forget the system our free
commercial

24
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,979
the system also need to compute an
undershirt funtion

25
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,979
100 today %uh m2m mmm

26
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:51,770
its ok importance I'll because

27
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:52,890
him

28
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,860
said the system such perverted on

29
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,200
me lol June on

30
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,410
make quote services

31
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:06,570
arm on sequel on the post so for example

32
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,780
if this less inclined a heel

33
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,870
wish to come get some function our his
friend data on

34
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,630
and a he pheasant

35
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:21,790
enough computational power to make this
competition

36
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:27,100
as a No he might use will come with a
trip the system complete his date

37
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,320
and a he'll gives onto the server

38
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:37,209
encrypting data and the center do
competition I'll in group to data into

39
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:41,370
he the severed owns a result argue the
client

40
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,959
injured in 54 a soul this sensitive data
look land

41
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:55,430
remains I'll he didn't up you're in the
love the process of competition and of

42
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,970
course

43
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:59,959
this makes of 100 the system is a very
important

44
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:03,350
I'll to present data

45
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,420
are in gloves so

46
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,500
him

47
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,170
here there is a more formal definition
of love will come with the trip the

48
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:13,900
system's

49
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,250
on are in fact it's usually a supposed
does it

50
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,420
up plain text in subjects form some

51
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,500
remix r is the a operations

52
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,540
all addition and multiplication
respectively

53
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,610
and them if the system

54
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,830
is fleet so much %uh if a.m. the sump
and

55
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,989
uploader all subjects workers want

56
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:42,420
kill some product all

57
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:47,370
plain text and also are addition

58
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,790
and multiplication operation other
search for text a must be in

59
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:56,269
computed efficient and a

60
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:00,269
in fact if aggression other plaintiffs
up on Form

61
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:03,400
acumen company basis are then

62
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,170
are a name funtion any problem

63
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,599
when the computed other data in then
shifted form for example

64
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:14,270
if plaintiffs on beats and a operation

65
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:18,470
others them on addition module

66
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,620
to and Joe conjunction be

67
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,200
between suppliers on and Joel

68
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,729
no although there is a brief assume open
just in a state of affairs

69
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:33,860
in the field of him arm

70
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,349
a team 'em 2009

71
00:04:38,349 --> 00:04:40,849
mmm it to

72
00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:45,219
gonna proposed itself will come with a
cryptosystem

73
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:48,949
and all only in 2008 09

74
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:52,309
IBM researcher Greg a gym shoes a
proposal first

75
00:04:52,309 --> 00:04:55,650
will come of it with the system %uh it
was

76
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:59,279
I'll waste %uh one 'em cart

77
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:02,339
problems in lettuces and

78
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:06,900
this soak up the system was so probably
a sequel against the

79
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,949
different important to perfect types of
attacks

80
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:13,550
%uh but its totally inefficient

81
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,939
and it can be used in real applications

82
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:21,020
so in subsequent looks ginger and his
colleagues

83
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,759
improve one improves improved

84
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:28,589
original the system jin Shin but

85
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:33,129
us to you each's its performance is
terrible and

86
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:37,259
it can be used in practice so many im

87
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:40,860
researchers tries to from for some

88
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,719
dirty we have affected the system and
the main direction

89
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:50,349
here is jewel tried to construct will
come look at the system

90
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:53,830
waste one are the problem

91
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,759
big number two position that is known

92
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,270
that is him studied very willing to
split second trip dollar fee and it is

93
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,259
known to be caught

94
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:07,130
diesel %uh so in fact

95
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,430
a.m. today there are several affected in
ways

96
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,870
will come with a trip to see them are
into

97
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,960
they are simple the efficient them more
efficient than

98
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,250
ginger style will come look at the
system but

99
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,639
are there is a problem is security
because

100
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,500
from menu for this 15 ways

101
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,860
we have homework the system the waters
do to improve

102
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:37,479
Street the reduction ours it breaking up
the system

103
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:41,550
is not easier than to fuck terrace big
numbers it

104
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:46,199
is used include the system and in love
this look was done here

105
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:49,610
the resistance of 01 we'll come look at
the system

106
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,849
on but one

107
00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:56,800
15 problem and it was proposed

108
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,970
in our 2013 by all-russian Research

109
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:07,810
group from the worst fears in

110
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:10,830
and we

111
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,349
arm analyze its resistance to

112
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:18,020
such important double for tech is a
known plaintext

113
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:24,150
to this to protect suggested adjuster
the trying to break up the system

114
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:28,669
has several players splint except for
texts over said project

115
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:32,380
in Greek black plain text and the same
secret key

116
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,849
was used when reaction a function for
all the best I N Durham

117
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:41,530
oh the security against this stuff

118
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:45,789
use a standard a requirement to keep the
system

119
00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:49,030
and this scenario when the drill Syria

120
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:53,680
intercepted several players plaintiffs
such projects by

121
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,240
eavesdropping of channel is very
realistic

122
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,620
are so on

123
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,970
way we analyze this trip this system

124
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:07,370
just a fool it is seem

125
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:12,580
under its other inpatient this very good
prospects are to be used

126
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:16,220
in real build-up cation but

127
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,050
before up a.m. and also there was no
service

128
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,440
okay the system have already used to
implement

129
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,940
the brave a data storage are but

130
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,169
persecute you all district the system
wasn't

131
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:33,649
started so early and ratio

132
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:37,550
we think this game p.m. on

133
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,870
show bullets a brief call her call

134
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:45,320
this if the system looks no there is a
big number

135
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,540
im arbiters a product of two big brands

136
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,050

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,960
all ok impatience some

148
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,500

157
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,370
it is easier to show did up p.m.

excesses

165
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:41,660
a whim the they are multiplied are the
losers

166
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,780
owners get the system on if you want

167
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:48,640
love it eaters %uh sequel against a
non-text

168
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,670
Dec and this suppose

169
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:55,320
supposed that miss a cutie in this
attack

170
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,449
is aligned or not

171
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:00,100
the problem of upturned OMB number M

172
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,730
but it is known to behind and

173
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,430
here to show the in fact its

174
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:12,130
not true and a it's now to intercept

175
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:16,910
only to even one this to brake disc into
system and

176
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:21,420
to recover the pictures ish of n and to
find the secret but no

177
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:26,009
in and this success of a tip

178
00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:29,079
the probability of success is

179
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:39,259
close it to one on here

180
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:42,290
abiam Highland the mean properties

181
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:45,519
that lol chill great this up the system

182
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,819
on we supposedly have to Paris plane tix
effort it's

183
00:11:50,819 --> 00:11:55,060
endo mmm there is

184
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,279
the following proper to plan a Mills
equals

185
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:02,380
a true the difference between separate
texts and plain text

186
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,750
a modular im 15 min of up to

187
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,689
a modular be and this common factor in
fact

188
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:13,170
is in secret by a non-null all

189
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:16,569
that is a secret key Aegis easy to see
you

190
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,920
if to understand

191
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,410
it is easily follows from the algorithm

192
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:29,069
of encryption him and

193
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:32,480
this property thank you for the stretch
in shared to

194
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,720
analyze the cryptosystem to

195

and then arm a secret but not all

199
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:54,660
my computed is a common divisor open on
us

200
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,750
on equal to on separate checks

201
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,890
mind as plain text more do it be four
even

202
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:04,500

now by the competition of arm

245
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,180

294
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,100
and we %um implement 0 attack

295
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,270
and this cryptosystem

296
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:48,200
course and here

297
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:54,170
you can see experimental date even

298
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:58,200
floods degrees of said did on

299
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,400

00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,200
and I'll p.m. end

301
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,820
here there is an experimental just a
mission a probability to recover

302
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,390
beat you in secret a key you

303
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:17,610
you miss you did each's

304
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:22,930
close to a muscle the experiment

305
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:26,800
confirms this year p.m. and

306
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,550
to sum up I would like 2.0 that

307
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:33,720
infant this

308
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:39,200
the system use totally infusion if the
unsecured against mom

309
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,860
accepted because hiatus the officers

310
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,510
up almost to published to publish

311
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:49,780
arm an encryption 0

312
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,600
0 plain text to reduce are the sizes of
said

313
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,790
text zone you're in on their
multiplication so

314
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:00,150
there is on in the nursery

315
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,740
always

316
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,540
his one player went excessive texts

317
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:08,160
so it's another to intercept only one

318
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,140
better to break the system on

319
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,860
soul and fun never liked

320
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,370
not wasn't William

321
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:22,790
I would take is are similar

322
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:27,530
tomb our take is inspired

323
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:30,960
by attack from almost by one are

324
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,330
or not algebraic come with a
cryptosystem

325
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:39,640
proposed by the membership and

326
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,490

a regular person

00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:33,309
the person wasn't but if you have any
questions questions could be as common

338
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:34,350
in Russia language

339
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,650
them you talk about

yes been applied to and some very narrow

00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,600
about application symptoms to implement
over there but the experimental

346
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,320
implementations and in fact

347
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,980
but is no working option

fine-tuned for a specific verification
about general Dr

00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:21,740
going over there is going to be become
that they were not

352
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:35,049
well

353
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:46,190

loose weakness over a proposed algorithm

356
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,100
to expand its weakness so the algorithm

357
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:06,230
is a direct consequence old for the
improvements originally made to the

358
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,480
original algorithm

359
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,810
Gentry didn't modify

360
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:17,550
terrorism Gentry to propose their own
well to contribute system is absolutely

361
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,360
the print is based on the

362
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,570
great tool and visible in Oman

363
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:25,970
and it does compactors ation so this
probably is

364
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:30,040
inspired by the mangueira Krupa system
so they didn't analyze it

365
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,070
for this tournament soon will discover

366
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,340
criticisms you mentioned cares

367
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:40,550
show to express some assumptions

368
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:43,590
the beach could be security gains

00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,760
there was a hole in the proper system

372
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,380
no interest in her publication

373
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:04,799
whether they have in mind analysis

374
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:18,000
a real as everything it's broken
resilient thank you

375
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,560
we think we're gonna blow which include
but are not

376
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,800
relevant to the subject to report a lot
know your opinion about

377
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,160
I'm more areas you see

378
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,040
and development dove homophobic group
shown

379
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:45,899
make them more practical fully implement
all

380
00:24:45,899 --> 00:24:49,080
by the criticisms that Gentry's working
on

381
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,659
honestly speaking alice is made a
showing that the newest addition most

382
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:54,299
probably nothing

383
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:57,330
practically would implement the mall

384
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:01,779
will be proposed about the clipper
system some speculation

385
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:07,419
so far all over them are loopholes could
be easily broken

386
00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:12,039
a colleague who is doing them

387
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:15,600
Harbor make encryption and doing well
let me know

388
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,070
alternative people in whom a McRib a
system based on demand pics palomas

389
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:23,419
bar as we know it

390
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:27,669
so met some analysis brothers Matt
Dillon

391
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:31,059
learned royal production soon requires

392
00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:34,260
fine-tuning so presumably the

00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,490
complication bull

394
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:40,760
complication urban I'm polynomial

395
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:47,059
quality but it's very very complex and
difficult task but so far we haven't

396
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:50,799
proof these well

397
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,549
can see better what's up someone up in
the air soap in question

398
00:25:54,549 --> 00:26:02,750
purplish those who would happen

399
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:07,450
many questions thank you
