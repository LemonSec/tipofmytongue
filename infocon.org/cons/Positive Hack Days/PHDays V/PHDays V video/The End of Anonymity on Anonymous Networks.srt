7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,300
tonight men's system adapts to sell the
bats

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:34,160
some things that are not available on
Munchen morton reforms

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,470
my colleague marcia years as a
randomizer to

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:42,780
to conceal herself from different kinda
block insisted that LogMeIn IP on Knoji

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,690
location

12
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:48,530
to why do you guys do there he so those
who rose

13
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,700
area and justice shutout wide do you
guys do there

14
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,219
the weapons drugs

15
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,809
guns bastards him my name is

16
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:04,299
Deniece and here's my colleague idea
will tell you about the things church

17
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:07,000
looking onto our C you know this dude
rate

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,009
this is Laura roswell breaked and

19
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:13,380
party that into those who implored him
he creates a crawdad

20
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,790
and he was the admin out that forum
which was the ground number one to sell

21
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,520
drugs weapons guns

22
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,110
said this guy Aaron about to hire a
million dollars but

23
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:26,440
if you actually read the committee
consequence the an investigation there

24
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,289
no technical details and how they
actually got this guy how the

25
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:32,640
arrested him so there's a beat as a
person simply wasn't

26
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,979
on I was leaving seized a Aaron emails
or in public but that doesn't explain

27
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:38,259
how exactly

28
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:42,619
the found the guy in the cafe the way he
was logged into the or a man

29
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:45,659
arrested him bare-bones you

30
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,940
the other example as the

31
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,810
recently caused money and resources into
the dark net whenever i close more than

32
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:53,570
400

33
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,730
different grounds I related to juror

34
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,790
this and

35
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,630
didn't I'll on GE

36
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:06,119
is so there are no technical details
name situation how actually FBI

37
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,259
God the socket and switched up the
servers but the sites were actually

38
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:11,000
blocked

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,480
apply can we find out from them on the
source about the problems of

40
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,400
I

41
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,829
the atomization up by where users so
with just a few things sermon

42
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:25,420
two years ago one person well

43
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,590
she did leak schilit she documents from
an essay

44
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:34,480
so what can we get from there for still
a few years ago they were able to you

45
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,470
Airtel or button but now dismissal and
Biden is not used anymore

46
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,780
the guys are trying to exploit miss Tila
at

47
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,069
it is important to know here that
disconnects I did not survive for long

48
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:51,020
it's easy to find them and a

49
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,880
the number abusers he to apply to them
is

50
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,360
was limited besides the accepted the
canard

51
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,410
the and my salt for users simultaneously
with the two worst things

52
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:04,370
they said it get the a pic Indiana
miserly a limited amount at not

53
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,110
accordion aloni Nantes

54
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:09,560
cell there were a few investigations
where and

55
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,280
by researchers show different channels
release about the press but to our users

56
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,460
but resident or

57
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,870
for example flash well and you watch the
flash video

58
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:21,700
there's a possibility that the channel
will lead to the server to the attack in

59
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,300
server

60
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,910
with the outset connection when you
watch the flash however the tumor

61
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,500
developers

62
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,720
better quickly and prevent deflation
accounts compassionate or browser

63
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,730
ish the RTC lead briefly assuming

64
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:40,180
between two libraries however is urs on
that video stream the object simply

65
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:45,310
exchange their IP addresses so the IP
address can be leaked as well sell

66
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,480
this misunderstanding was clearly
quickly fixed cell

67
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,610
up

68
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,680
interesting research here is the traffic
analyzer space in traffic analyzes the

69
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,720
guys trying to identify the entry node

70
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,909
that a person is headed toward however
all these things required resources

71
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:04,930
bottom

72
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:08,920
for my visit no its not inside it were
not edit or so

73
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,799
in RP and Courtney researcher would
never be able to you

74
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,180
I'm raises conform to you

75
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,570
so this have researched leaks did not
give an answer to the question first

76
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,660
how did the FBI guys found the they find
it was certain form

77
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,910
up which recently I know on my neighbor
knows where few people

78
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,270
gorgeous I use it all alone like the but
an admin and secondly how did the fun

79
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,060
actually me my AP address so

80
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,470
let's try to answer those questions
first lesson with subsystem

81
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:41,650
collection I their views examples here
the exit node railroads the exit go

82
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:42,370
together my

83
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,880
friend I'm Iran even if you're in the
audience please raise your hand he he

84
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,130
promised to come

85
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:53,190
and listen to members days a week large
the turnout which had one key feature

86
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,889
it was able to transmit traffic through
all the ports and had a slippery

87
00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:00,690
as well as the sniffer doing it was
catching all the connections had all the

88
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:01,889
HTTP connections

89
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:05,449
with a week for heading so if the person
said its board

90
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:09,349
click certainly get gets to the outside
lab

91
00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:13,139
then this package Jimmy Carter exit not
so

92
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:16,910
played a lot of interesting things there
and the first thing that we have now

93
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,120
actually was very promising swim I need
to get there some

94
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,720
super mega private forums or the G hard
sites however the first thing we powers

95
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,940
this think connecting the penis line so
would lot

96
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,550
that can t you know so

97
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:37,190
we didn't do a ride down you know which
had to continue then analyzed the dumps

98
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,410
what happened in the dump

99
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:43,480
but Lexmark is a different kind of trash
but the market selling me a race a pass

100
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,470
or its

101
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:48,880
edge in databases so which are
considered to be leaked

102
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,890
Sweden he decided I'm browser developers

103
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:57,630
weird jazz blues on Ian resources and
said to reposition themselves as

104
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:01,190
to me you need people to get the money
for simply developing their

105
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,640
sightings headed toward ordinary cited
said when they were little

106
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,690
resource any pets were so I'm have no no
idea what's behind their

107
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,220
we even had a facebook so but I'll say

108
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,930
the significant traffic on it got a
question where are the only ones doing

109
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,330
is having the traffic

110
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:19,900
they lie there lotta I do so for example
there is a card in our company who does

111
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,430
that

112
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:24,490
on also he does the following: he
collects on your resources

113
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:29,950
could and categorizes them so we took
this beautiful site should know that

114
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:34,130
sure what kinda categories according to
his datya

115
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:38,350
are present and dark netted course to be
spy

116
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,930
to the pie chart is the black market and
some other small things like

117
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,409
warned teams instead

118
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:49,530
sexually passive system does not to give
the answer to the question how they

119
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,169
found large or small brecht

120
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:54,860
and how they were able to see how the
ABA's able to identify the

121
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,879
IP address here's the concert at The
Exorcist would help us this is known

122
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:02,189
provoked these are the two were to give
up and some his personal data for

123
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:02,770
example

124
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:07,110
at their system like this in 2014 the
levy et un security

125
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:11,039
I am researching system found the major
basic notes which were

126
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,389
integrating the a malicious code in do

127
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:19,650
into the into the batteries so but
easily fixed by the bike which is

128
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:23,779
get through the exit nonce and as a
result compare the traffic that they did

129
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:24,520
not skip

130
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,830
to the original dubbed so the

131
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:33,110
the slightest difference it's the ninth
a black lace but

132
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:37,469
sure what can we do more simple here for
example we can identify future

133
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:41,000
by the browser for example
fingerprinting here's the solution

134
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,169
their lot of projects lotta projects
online

135
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:47,729
move with which I which it's possible to

136
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:52,979
a find hidden identifiers with which you
can find the user track the user

137
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:57,300
hitting field see you in HDB header the
plugins

138
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,940
water tell the Point Defiance

139
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:07,029
red as well as very well a normal at an
ordinary rap

140
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:12,310
love and agencies use that as well
however

141
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,710
there's no way to exploit this into
order lot of these features

142
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,910
so the story to

143
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:23,140
research the seven how to configure
permanent war because

144
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,160
it's much easier that what we have for

145
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,770
a

146
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,460
a good talked about there is there
sufficient earning called the cook your

147
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,490
super cookie

148
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,690
those things are not saved on toward

149
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,990
sewn feel like one session perhaps he
can do them between close to the browser

150
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,510
there's nothing can be done

151
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:46,490
nothing can be done there celled

152
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,959
there's still some some peaks

153
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,580
and a torso there's so-called Tech
campus in East enough I which

154
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,220
lies to create and render the rest to
reimage and render something at the

155
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,760
user's machine so now

156
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:06,089
this is mostly is in browser game soon
one drawing graphics

157
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:09,410
however good

158
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,850
this last creating the you need eight is
so what do we get here

159
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:16,170
the first thing we got a cam and cam is
that we guide

160
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:20,600
their use for fingerprinting get damaged
a tear which was

161
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,450
acquiring pixels are the unique image is
blocked and two more

162
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:28,270
and we get the following notification
however allow your looks like this is

163
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,920
Anissa Kate has been closed

164
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,620
however I'm there's now their function

165
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,790
which are now she with punctures they're
not by bike tube or sausages major taxed

166
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,149
yeah

167
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:43,089
which can cause the width by the way
render taxed in the chemists

168
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:46,809
so it might seem certain cases the lead
attacks

169
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:51,399
my BMI have a floating-point which
actually has the a lot of numbers

170
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:55,059
and can be used as a fingerprint at the
unique user because his rendering with

171
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:55,759
the band

172
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:58,740
happen on the software other hardware

173
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,940
air and so on so

174
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,080
personally option that allows us to get
the unique identifiers for example

175
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,980
but there's another example the function
and dad calculates the without the UN

176
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,850
tangle

177
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:16,959
which just just just yeah I'm just
around something say the taxed

178
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,880
to the goddess and grocer decided the
fire is not locked into a ring did he

179
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,260
get

180
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:25,660
you can he get the unique number by the
way they're just been in your bedroom is

181
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,440
ill and we know that the two brothers
from is a

182
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,580
for window is eastern Missouri so is the
updated

183
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,220
that unfortunately blocks the new this
major texts

184
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,360
is so fingerprints a missile is hard to
do however into your browser

185
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,940
still this thing work so we're waiting
for this to be fixed under the sink the

186
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,459
second

187
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:44,950
function get bounding I was talking
about it's still present in both

188
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:48,430
said

189
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:52,060
how come the tour developers dunno about
it of course to do know here's near the

190
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,680
screen shows the official

191
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,480
responses to the tickets so perhaps it's
too small a text

192
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,480
however other response was the full yeah
we know about this

193
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,730
week could have blocked the major taxed

194
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:09,240
and put out there were no identification
this is why they would do with other

195
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:09,970
functions

196
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:14,529
such as get image data but we do believe
that this kind of approach headed

197
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:17,649
is pointless right now because first a
ball

198
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:21,180
we could get their similar fingerprint
without using this functions at all but

199
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,589
using other technologies

200
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:25,430
even with the even numbers for

201
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:29,390
other words however also when globally
months change

202
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,779
be pushed me to text the other problem
and the

203
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:37,790
refer to the other ticket which his
dedicated to the integration

204
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,630
out there I

205
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,699
into a defiant to the door prize you
have this ticket is at present for a

206
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:43,279
long time

207
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,300
and there's certain problem with
integrate the bill to advance

208
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,050
so the proof that got the concept is
that this thing was we

209
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:54,320
large the standard to the blog with
here's the would-be

210
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,920
a unique user unique visitors sold
reporting

211
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,970
to this thing 128 civil

212
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,620
unique users visit the blog so here
there's opened up a need

213
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,529
I'll unique threats sold every year
visitor

214
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:13,430
is it to get his thread and I'm sure
that there had to be a Dr

215
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:16,600
potential to our clients in his book so
integrate the script

216
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,759
dad does the following: calculates the
perimeter

217
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:24,060
other pond and person don't like that

218
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:28,149
hugh we love interest in dating at La

219
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:34,269
you and keep on I researching it was
huge to browsers your lunch with in

220
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:36,259
virtual machines in different operating
systems

221
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:40,250
get the unique fingerprints and the
fingerprint doesn't change

222
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:44,050
on a certain hardware a given hardware
so you that's how

223
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:47,399
could dead be used in in in the wild in
the field

224
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:51,279
we scanned him over 100

225
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:56,209
babbitt nineteen we swore sis defined
web on our abilities and after that

226
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:59,709
a false after neglect other possible is
to be realized that the

227
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:02,920
their 30 percent %uh the scanned users
has

228
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,170
did a allows to integrating the

229
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:10,370
in the random JavaScript code so

230
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:14,540
the structure other search the by the
FBI can get now the exit now it's

231
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,960
but also all the web sites and other web
resource including the internal external

232
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,070
data vulnerable

233
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:24,770
to the XSS attacks you and allowed into
a JavaScript code to do so

234
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:29,220
there's always an opportunity to a
slimmed-down weighs a lot of State

235
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:29,850
website

236
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,140
for different subset this website to get
to drugs to

237
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:37,070
and cats to guns and not get users in
their

238
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:41,890
now imagine the scenario the user into
or get a website which contains the

239
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:42,550
actress has

240
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:46,010
so that website is dedicated to the
drugs so he continues her playing with

241
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,280
my

242
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,240
and he gets trådar we needed to guns
and then that person

243
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,730
it's our that gets out into the internet
for example gets into some LinkedIn

244
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:57,960
profile were conducted a warp

245
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,590
neither some other for whatever so what
do we get there that we get that

246
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:06,730
behind the actual fingerprint there's
two major psychological

247
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,150
there's psychological portrayed his
history on base in which you may

248
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,640
conclude about that person

249
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,680
of course weird data we have certain
doubts that we invented this concept of

250
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,260
course

251
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,330
probably somebody uses that already up

252
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:26,490
little is so passion where's the end up
the anonymity

253
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:31,800
in another scene in social networks it
ends where there's no chavis credited

254
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,899
we'll mussah believes the differently

255
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:38,880
so let's as careless as casts are so

256
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,120
good I'm it on please raise your hand

257
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:58,279
annual you can ask em

258
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:06,550
hehehe said

259
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,430
Google so there's a question you

260
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,350
is possible to save and living in
principle a different browser on one

261
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:12,940
computer

262
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,040
know each other again seen if you can
have it saved in the browser that

263
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,020
hardware

264
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:23,010
and it'll be unique with new

265
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:27,340
they were different in your presence
here but they'll be unique

266
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:41,330
in a framework that hardware and even
hardware

267
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:45,030
good question about the mega to make a
surgeon

268
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:48,260
toward the middle of a major changes
and/or and

269
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,130
their old ways we can lock system there
personally had a lock switch and edit or

270
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:52,760
add

271
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,080
to get information out there so things
like Google you know he's going

272
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,250
intellectual

273
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,750
surgeon is i'd turn to say to went there

274
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,850
as in June I don't know how they work
internally but their parsing the

275
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,400
galitsin for sure

276
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,220
he on the audio and resources in step
that's for sure

277
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:15,000
only me

278
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,720
kid you think your boyfriend might
chicken the answer to that question it

279
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,279
their country matchers che

280
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,449
a a make the sect need to stop this
technique from working

281
00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:29,829
so what are the solutions is to
integrate the buttons ons

282
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:35,709
just griffey's abusing you to stop using
this system France which are

283
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:40,129
did an end on the system so then

284
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:45,389
now needed an elite or developers I
think and their cells also the Firefox

285
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:46,930
lepers I think another so

286
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:51,980
as a result all the fans will be similar
and they will not possible to make it

287
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,139
fingerprint however

288
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:57,490
make a remark here in theory the
fingerprint in general can be built

289
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:01,339
only base and fonts this just the
evidence think that we see

290
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:04,360
however but there are certain ideas

291
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:09,059
a that this can be done based on the

292
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:12,120
some performance at the hardware you
know

293
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,339
but there's no actual proof of concept
it's too complicated but you can dig in

294
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,480
their direction as well

295
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:28,820
hopefully answer your question where you
are asking a different thing

296
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:34,430
so when a person has to do up

297
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,550
sorry cannot hear the questions still
not able to misstated

298
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:40,630
so there are a lot of scenarios here for
example you can

299
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:44,180
for the script I guess the fingerprint
for me and you can fill it with the

300
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,570
question is how can you can if

301
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:49,160
take a fingerprint of course they're
called back ons

302
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,700
way into or which you the user's

303
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:58,360
will make that funds said me not passive
not be possible to make a fingerprint

304
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,560
from those that haunts

305
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:04,090
can you tell about the car back funds
yes there's a contra manager

306
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:08,550
at which is called that funds

307
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:11,620
went or browser limits the access to the
bonds

308
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:15,380
field limited to quantity of 10 from

309
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:19,160
bond so we can only a

310
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,350
he only request for ten fonts and all
the other funds are requested to

311
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,330
defaulted bonds

312
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,920
but that measure can actually be with
walked around to

313
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,390
I will tell about it later in more
detail perhaps because it would

314
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:35,150
get too complicated however but the user
can do

315
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:40,690
only disable javascript because there's
no a freezer to page 2 brother to make a

316
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,650
group everything we're differently so
for example

317
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:46,840
the functions would be given different
results guys we have to run away but not

318
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,390
depart way around so

319
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:53,420
he was we're giving ground to give the
floor to the next presentation

320
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,040
thank you very much
