1
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:06,220
sleuth

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,959
company if the pro colleague yes so here
goes and

3
00:00:09,959 --> 00:00:13,360
if connections here not the girl

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,310
shown absolute genius so I have my
colleagues here and there were going to

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,699
discuss a number of for

6
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:25,160
I am sir but for have become quite
painful

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,339
a a dip practical security conferences
about the crypto graffiti in Russia

8
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:34,110
so Vera

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,840
very many are perceptions that we can
hear and and argue

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,539
both serve online and offline it's a set
of kind of mists

11
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:48,690
some of them are are

12
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,600
are true someone not

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,030
dir related to the fact that although

14
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,340
cryptography in Russia is obsolete

15
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,640
and 25 years old the solution base its
slow

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,360
system up issues with sustainability and
our

17
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,540
overseas call excess sometime a

18
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,890
making very strange publications sir

19
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,909
support these me if anthem

20
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:21,750
as the a strange perception

21
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,390
is that in russia although cryptography
is our other

22
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,570
you know paper security oriented

23
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:32,290
but not is paper-based Ameen bureaucracy
based

24
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:37,090
but not to providing real protection so
we would like to share

25
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:41,100
probably discuss

26
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,110
and we would like a to have a
constructive discussion

27
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,950
not a mythological so why

28
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:55,469
is that of concern to us many partners
and integrators Billy you

29
00:01:55,469 --> 00:02:01,189
in a set of myths and cliches and very
often they use a

30
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:04,719
scheme when to they use foreign

31
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,860
algorithm when

32
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,880
in the lines

33
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,980
in with a highest load is a use RCR
assay

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,970
or a hier said so and when they need to
certify

35
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:28,560
see a provide their am efforts by
certificate which is less

36
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,120
secure and very of fun

37
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,110
as we can see it the contradicts the
ideas

38
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:40,660
of a real protection and the other
consequence

39
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,720
quite painful is so that very off from

40
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,700
say how free im year ago there was a key
so one

41
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,120
at a conference on practical security

42
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,870
as there was a presentation

43
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:01,200
no about that some Russian cryptography
solutions and the criticism

44
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,550
was not constructive it was a

45
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:09,380
kind of from bookish which is probably
not good because the real

46
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,380
vulnerabilities multiple

47
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:16,280
insecurities and risks are what would
like a

48
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,320
to to address sir by experts and
practical security

49
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:27,890
on their me more attentively

50
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:32,960
and a as a result as a practical
security experts have

51
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:38,110
for lesser tools so all Russian
cryptography

52
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,830
is being discarded who as a crypto
grippers

53
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:47,260
have very means strange dubious
reputation they have to prove themselves

54
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:52,110
from scratch that to very good time

55
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,210
they have to prove that there are no
vulnerabilities

56
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:59,220
and in spite of information about real
threats

57
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:04,680
there is a number of cliche Easter that
does not to give you anything

58
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,900
a practical so so

59
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:14,690
Lance so talk about this sustainability
probably

60
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:18,290
the sustainability of our block

61
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:24,060
meh Colts under no after

62
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,590
Z a Court of attacks so

63
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,190
after the I saw committee

64
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:34,300
hearing so there were 405 particles
which

65
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,350
are claimed

66
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,560
in small France

67
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:47,220
and comments for that that for nobody
reads comments but the numbers

68
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,950
remain in memory so he actually

69
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:54,590
if you consider his work in detail and
that he

70
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,230
are also admit to that its core to our

71
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,740
where that says that there is no

72
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,950
a sustainability issue

73
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,670
I am

74
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:12,150
cannot spend too much time I'll give you
a Zillow Inc

75
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:18,790
and are there is an article was a

76
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,330
court or analysis quite quite for
comprehensive one

77
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,440
and a this is an example a prim

78
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:32,280
screen of his stride from a conference
that says

79
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,600
that he ignores some the

80
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,680
deter complexity and just for

81
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,729
compares their running time: but in the
comments

82
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:46,280
and a mass media messages so

83
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,440
we see own and

84
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,979
there the question that I is there

85
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:57,010
there's a some very well I thought out

86
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:02,030
attacks her and assists cassava and in
or a

87
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,199
done kill on Trulia and

88
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,300
not going into detail so certain that
there is a certain level of

89
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,630
a robustness and sustainability in by
their own

90
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,229
aerial attacks richer brought about

91
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:20,560
the possibility to organize such attacks
earner

92
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,500
and back Eve did the rules of the use of

93
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,520
the scripture to to

94
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,800
encryption not sure to use it properly
if so then

95
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,139
attendees attacks cannot be launched a
if you if the if the encryption is

96
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:36,010
properly done

97
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:39,030
submit that sir from so than a few

98
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,650
a Senate to ratify the algorithm you
need just to check for

99
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,780
this algorithm for its robustness and
then nothing will happen but

100
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,780
buddy but the robustness a of

101
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,050
the held in corruption from

102
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,560
so we'll be able to guarantee against
any attack I saw the all-cash in

103
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,539
function their situation is bad

104
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:02,240
and because the old a hashing function
meh

105
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,610
so there were two successful attacks sir
and

106
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,599
fork for finding collision and looking
for another

107
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,630
MN sure a

108
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:16,800
Hannah and center so that said the
damage was cohorts was quite customer

109
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,220
planned even now dewey

110
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,640
her so introduced in you hashing
standard function

111
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,640
at and and the way issued

112
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,030
there's a new a document that

113
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:34,160
so how to set the system should be
migrated to add a new standard

114
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,390
so this is the document reflects that
tend to

115
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,610
are all companies need to almost in your
standard

116
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,980
is the gold standard in a and they're so
the standard to

117
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:49,170
for a bus there sir how is quite a circa
2002 work has been done

118
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:52,950
especially recently into so there are
some a

119
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,610
from

120
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,129
the Federal Security Service so there
were a number over

121
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:02,400
I assault Anderson bids and signed
actually the

122
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,930
have to work it was presented to them
for their attention

123
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:09,120
a a so that sort trying to

124
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,300
work with a robust things and %uh so
they they sustain told a tax and their

125
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:14,729
son

126
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:18,529
first cursors was happy with that and
Anna

127
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:22,210
so what to actually specialists

128
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:27,080
on the custer's curator at we're talking
about that the state authorities

129
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,339
the in it to select constant to make it

130
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:34,240
mad went out I V yourself for spoke

131
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,669
to text that to the nation data stream
for using this

132
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:41,919
Constance me are a result in reducing

133
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,440
her a robustness about to our college so
from the state authorities

134
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,769
so they there or just saying that

135
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:53,880
her had that Hall Constance that we have
inched

136
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,250
and in strip poker her so they

137
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,810
hardy images harkin other functions so
getting

138
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:07,510
something so cannot be proven by
arbitrary

139
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:11,290
hydration so selecting the constant to
if there is a

140
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:16,339
sumner have on their ability secure not
select those costumes that will she then

141
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:20,750
like keys is not possible now the state
authorities are attempting

142
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,940
have to justify that they offer
solutions

143
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,760
her car not to so allegedly

144
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,529
not not a robust enough for them

145
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:35,380
Picasa so there are some box and every
algorithm

146
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,500
so then electronic signature is quite
straightforward

147
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,960
electronic signature for a bus this does
not

148
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,529
differ from TCG CA this is the same

149
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:49,770
and I'll although this a

150
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:54,440
someone criticized the selection of held
up to curves

151
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,980
a for about mister how but the day
guarantee our

152
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,620
arbitron miss of a one-time hah

153
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:07,339
have values Indian in the process of
signature

154
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:11,430
nasa is quite good service this minute
to remember too so they have on their

155
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:14,290
ability of trying to tan and Sony
Playstation 3

156
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:17,630
so I had two problems in the

157
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:21,459
and the realization of PCG CA's where
the constant

158
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:25,959
was put in so instead of arbitrary

159
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:30,940
values so that certain reduced certainly
reduce their robustness

160
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,970
so much the same time so is comparable
to the american Standard

161
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,060
ac/dc on dinner

162
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,759
refresh efficiency hi

163
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:46,160
so we know that has say that our
standard is better than

164
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,829
CDC is it's not true has so than

165
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:53,750
out the so you can see

166
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:57,449
here the implementation as a Bernstein

167
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:00,810
a a open SSL

168
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:05,380
her implementations you can see
different and this is the state standard

169
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,699
to is so pretty much the same levels

170
00:11:08,699 --> 00:11:13,120
have may depending on the catchers
pretty much the same level compatible

171
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,149
level home for her house

172
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:20,019
ha strength so than a certain they were
here in

173
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:23,510
so compatible compatible speed is pretty
much the same

174
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:28,160
and and what we have

175
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,380
for so I S well

176
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,980
P six times

177
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,700
more reliable than and cost but this not
because we are

178
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:43,670
we claim complaining about the standard
but this is the standard it's not the

179
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,310
cryptographic to perk up to over

180
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:50,350
is fine so than a if we emblem your show
it on a charter

181
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,360
and shorten the graphic her

182
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,870
manner then then go ask her if she is
quite good

183
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:00,180
so it's even better than I S hand

184
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,990
and thus far as its robustness is
concerned and a have about hash

185
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,810
functions

186
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,860
comparing something you should do
standard

187
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,029
eso our cost is not behind but pretty
much the same

188
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:16,730
and we %um better the second candidate
for Ash

189
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:20,490
tree ash 3 and certain seven batters

190
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:24,519
so this we r welfare pretty well about
this

191
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:29,529
about the signature for so the ac/dc a
so the spins at the same

192
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:34,250
her so they have for the selection
different fields and analytical curves

193
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,649
and how there is a signature so you can
compare them

194
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:40,770
current witnessed has p

195
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:44,690
857 or RCA ASSOCHAM

196
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,930
this August is compared to their
standards

197
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:51,250
comparable to the standards and

198
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:57,089
so we are somewhere in between the can
ever say pursuant to 680 and their say

199
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:00,610
15 316 then

200
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,959
checking so hours

201
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:08,010
power cost is at a good level so than

202
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:13,440
validation on the signature signature
validation and asserts is quite quite

203
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,510
good

204
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:19,000
so summit in the event when you talk
about the forming

205
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,120
signature don't cost as much better than
their say

206
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,790
and much more than head is better than
the CDC

207
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,290
and because when you form a signature

208
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:33,440
I had to say had does not have

209
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,610
any points like so there's a good

210
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:40,390
open key ca a so they use the

211
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,640
arbitrary random search random
parameters

212
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,360
percent this certainly gives a better
speed compared to the elliptical Kors

213
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:48,910
approach

214
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,920
some around them numbers

215
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,340
then what do we do or die state
standards or other costs if we

216
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,880
if we're incorrectly using an open key

217
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,720
circus we don't have our own key but we
have a solution

218
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,770
and that was reflected and
recommendation of the stamps

219
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:11,900
state standard can meet him Technical
Committee which address this issue quite

220
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,060
successful so that you can generate on

221
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,070
and and picky and

222
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:20,070
so with the recipient key is your stuff
going on

223
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:24,450
this procedure and then and adults and
cryptic

224
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:30,370
with the key that's incorrect in another
system so that differ heymann system

225
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,940
so this inscription which is

226
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:38,120
which is an open Kia Soul hashing so we

227
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:43,100
its related to so that to to use the
system many times

228
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,560
us so and time time

229
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,800
time quiet is the same as a time a

230
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,340
that is a quiet to check the validity of
the signatures are pretty much the same

231
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,070
time frame

232
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,690
so then this that the russians costs a

233
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:03,330
some quite good a robust and so that's
what was done in many solutions

234
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:06,350
and now the

235
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:10,860
do relationship between the security on
paper and the real

236
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,040
security him so what are the main

237
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,089
paper loss that would

238
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:21,560
so then I said Prime additional security
service over Russia

239
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,380
to cryptographic means and to corruption
means

240
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,870
and so than personal data his

241
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:32,300
is open it's not secret business
disorders

242
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:36,950
I'm going to quote from that instruction

243
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,830
so what they criticize HELOCs

244
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:44,440
is dead specialists the

245
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,650
the capital A date date they don't know
what crypto griffey's

246
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:53,940
and and the cursor because the
violations are not

247
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:59,850
and they're not just their related to
the real paper because it's ok papers

248
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,060
important and

249
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,370
so the securities are there is a model
entendi

250
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:08,589
on on paper only but not the religious
so they do not guarantee so the same

251
00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:13,860
security when in the combat

252
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,360
operation and the so there's a
certificate and

253
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,600
but ship it makes people unhappy

254
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,660
and then so it has to do with the
certification system

255
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,520
than another that this the requirements
are

256
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,810
ger confidential

257
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:36,560
and southern and so the engineers

258
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,800
have no have no chance in just to see
whether

259
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:44,720
1f two ks1 ks2 personae quote from that

260
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,670
author back yes one it's not a secret or
other

261
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:52,040
to commend how the real security

262
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,430
is related to the security that day

263
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:59,270
allegedly have on paper and a kiss one

264
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:04,309
is attacking outside the controls on

265
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:08,949
so I meaning there attacks against
cryptographic protocols

266
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:12,170
my network and so when it to

267
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:16,410
so when it first to protect ourselves so
from a so from

268
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,520
from a bad guy miss current just what
rights to attack protocols

269
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,800
outside not in-house and so does the
set-top

270
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,050
certain systems a me in sir

271
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:31,480
that would protect or gesture or
preclude

272
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,520
the axis to the hard drive from outside

273
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,960
done case 3 level

274
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,530
on the user has an access to the
computer but has now

275
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:45,420
access to the counter the user and

276
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,480
so they can attack her a

277
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,280
from another account from and another
account

278
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,080
and so this is certainly the idea was
just to stop

279
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,530
this unauthorized access aside as well
can see that what

280
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:03,540
day declare is different from what day

281
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:08,420
capturing miss dual security that at
this system provides unfortunately this

282
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:12,559
there's a difference some and

283
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,820
as where the keys are captive stored in
real systems

284
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:21,050
has served us a passive for sobers up
it's up it's a

285
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:24,420
there though the day is just a memory
stick a how or

286
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:30,130
it's an active autonomous calculator
force a functional hybrid solution sets

287
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,160
a functional key

288
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:36,660
carrier and or passive care if so then
this put on to protect

289
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:41,179
secure secure channel I son and a
passive care

290
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:45,059
so they use have to look in that goes to
the card

291
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:48,730
so after login lock logging

292
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:53,119
so the memory on the card contains the
cryptographic a

293
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:56,659
a us stored memory in

294
00:18:56,659 --> 00:19:00,529
and a and a key is always in memory and
an

295
00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:04,049
Inc a server active for her talk on

296
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:07,669
calculator after you do logging auditor

297
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:12,150
operations some a on the token happened

298
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:16,920
so which one is better which one is
worse so they criticized for solution

299
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:22,930
not to distract that it's it's possible
with the help of technical

300
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:27,730
means to intercept tolkan if there is a
bad guy trying to do that

301
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:32,800
and writing in here for so then

302
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,669
can just come to feed the signature so
with the help of this machine you have

303
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,570
an access to

304
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,580
this mission ones than you can count two
feet

305
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:45,300
can doctor the signature and if you have
an access to the channel

306
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,110
between the machine and the card and so
for example

307
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:53,110
remote operation mode and

308
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:57,570
so then there's a certain a son and his
be poor

309
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:01,960
to damn in some cases so the key is

310
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,910
is can be taken out after the first a

311
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:10,740
so attempts to hack the system for or
after the first leg in saudi miscreant

312
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,290
has

313
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:14,610
password and a you can just adding data
here once

314
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:19,460
a and so that is why I say their
simplicity of the key disappears

315
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:25,420
and so using the key years solicits

316
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:29,290
is possible to hack in your way so I
think you so active for

317
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:32,490
calculator so there's a problem

318
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:35,820
than they appear more serious

319
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:40,190
issues on the small card so they
calculate

320
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,290
so the elliptic curves and

321
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:47,020
takes time very lengthy procedure and
then if you don't

322
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,790
implemented correctly said can generate
a number of problems are related

323
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:55,660
to know take a look at Schiphol via
adjacent channels

324
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:00,340
from side chains and whatever you do so
the axis to the channel

325
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,340
it goes through the encryption on the
key

326
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,740
and so formally to

327
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:10,400
we'll and

328
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,500
when you start asking

329
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,120
so why this solution is used in the
system

330
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,120
and or hand

331
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:26,600
this is not this is not an argument and
it's makes happy people

332
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,590
are so that is this means

333
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:35,720
should be used Harley he for the in the
perpetrator cannot getting access to the

334
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,250
channel

335
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,810
time a to respect to whether tokens
active or not

336
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:43,330
so then another more advanced solution
whereby

337
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:48,010
Paso first minute protection a secure
channel

338
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:51,730
secure building and toca surfers who
identify the channel

339
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,290
and issue January two key and then

340
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,420
and then in securing the key you

341
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,550
a you do certain things so there sir

342
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:05,120
how you have a secure key and Anna

343
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,000
the question but that's where he's
adjusted

344
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,880
went to do transfer have decorations us
on on hi all

345
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,910
function and this is possible using

346
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:19,879
ks3 a certain ks3

347
00:22:19,879 --> 00:22:22,999
his is very easy for any user

348
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:26,949
is a chance for a perpetrator to get
access to the kid to the channel

349
00:22:26,949 --> 00:22:30,919
a so can you Kenya possible to protect

350
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:34,829
the d this channel if it goes through
them protect it

351
00:22:34,829 --> 00:22:39,249
a secure zone or not that's ok to use
the

352
00:22:39,249 --> 00:22:43,449
key the signatures correctly so I hope
that this example

353
00:22:43,449 --> 00:22:47,759
her demonstrates than formal PS one case
three

354
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:52,669
reflect the difference between the level
of security of the system and

355
00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:55,779
some others on the top of the iceberg
because has

356
00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:58,829
because hasher to level of security is
different

357
00:22:58,829 --> 00:23:03,059
from I want house

358
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:07,489
some his part a Honda notion of

359
00:23:07,489 --> 00:23:11,519
massacre in cryptographic cryptography
is secured

360
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:14,729
have different levels high level O level
and

361
00:23:14,729 --> 00:23:19,849
so about on their villages so we have
analyzed the following issues:

362
00:23:19,849 --> 00:23:23,809
so the basic cryptographic a algorithm
securing

363
00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:27,649
the have come commitment to a
cryptographic had have arisen

364
00:23:27,649 --> 00:23:32,559
on their ability occur to broker
protocols I have letter B which is set

365
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,619
and when your in bad the crypt iraq

366
00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:39,139
cryptographic group few years ago you

367
00:23:39,139 --> 00:23:43,129
we could have said so then see her
theory

368
00:23:43,129 --> 00:23:46,909
is not related to robustness of the
system and

369
00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:50,269
and because but now from

370
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:52,210
cat LS

371
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:56,360
based in Porto so there will be no
threats like that

372
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,860
picus so the attacks a beast and poodle

373
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:03,020
him clear form were described her

374
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:08,170
hand very well as a theory Martin to the
name fearing

375
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:12,810
at conferences as theoretical attacks
but no one penetrate attention that

376
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:16,440
they can materialize so these threats
and attacks could happen

377
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,170
and then and a majority of

378
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:29,790
on the servers are not protected in any
way so what are two mistakes

379
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:32,960
them what is considered that

380
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:40,380
will not be considered to encrypt our
fam what

381
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:46,190
what mistakes are not considered so for
example so low level topography mistakes

382
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:49,300
aside in incorrect to you so block

383
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,730
her regimes its ambassador he should be

384
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:57,310
shibi she than a appearance of

385
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:00,880
side channels aside if

386
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,930
the mechanism padding is not a

387
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:09,060
was not used in a secure fashion so they
can be easily

388
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:13,610
so intercepted by the by the gauges
surrealism

389
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:19,280
and that Afghan quick tourism or well
covering the gamut

390
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:23,710
up for a crisis for using the synchro

391
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:27,250
messages without guaranteeing

392
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:30,820
the term sub there to a random nature

393
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:35,420
send though unpredictability in from

394
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,700
and so to a lesser later so they're
sending this

395
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,130
has saying in case of

396
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:45,480
there and predictability and and if

397
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,880
the lolol to the Q Lotus

398
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,660
hire them to keep can take the sewer CBS
insisted

399
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:57,210
on their ability has sucky for every

400
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:00,580
from you package Intel s you do not use

401
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:04,120
a good unique a random synchro package

402
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,190
so you'll have a whole I

403
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:12,540
hand Gregory and barked in 2004 do work
talking about no one listened

404
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:16,200
no one paid attention and and

405
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:22,410
dole and result became famous in the in
the whole world in 2011 Hyundai

406
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:26,770
conducted successfully this attack and

407
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:30,190
if I we can be controlled by the
perpetrator

408
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:33,210
so than selecting one block

409
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:37,060
bite by bite bit by bit so then can

410
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,410
easily I so identified the the

411
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:45,240
encryption tax them suntan

412
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,870
so the national advertising to russian
macro photography before does attacks

413
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:53,250
here in russia sont les

414
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:57,360
Russian algorithms help Road buy tickets
-6

415
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,950
so they doctor this new

416
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:04,500
assault gamma type motor operation

417
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,780
and that no one could break it and

418
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,179
so the and the the

419
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:15,940
suffering encryption encryption machine

420
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:19,460
apps operated quite quite well

421
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:23,549
and service right for

422
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:26,710
perpetrate tries to hack into the system

423
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:30,659
and the most important components half
but the encryption

424
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:33,180
so

425
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:36,430
so that bad guy cannot cannot hack then

426
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:41,220
suffers a padding so if you are not
working with bad incorrectly

427
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,780
some because this is the scepter sceptre
of

428
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,910
by Constanze badland

429
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:51,320
before the end of the block wear pad
lawn is a number

430
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:55,720
half for required padding bytes

431
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:01,160
so than that perpetrator channel or

432
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:06,000
for on the other side of the channel you
can attack come back to launch an attack

433
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,220
exactly what was have proven in 2014

434
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:15,870
went to supplant force launch candidate
genes that hand

435
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:19,350
so each bite salvage block

436
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:22,400
can can can restore

437
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,900
now

438
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,750
lasso almost all the tax without a
written the key 120

439
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:31,730
so I N over the last but before

440
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:36,610
sometime early before this attack was
committed

441
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:39,640
tell your service it was described as
this

442
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,190
this attack could have been possible and

443
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:46,660
so this challenge

444
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,970
when Howard LS

445
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:53,020
spoke about this is set to arrest the
last version

446
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,900
one don't 0 for the

447
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:00,930
users of CBS sets of encryption was
ascribed

448
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:04,620
many years ago in 2001 if your take

449
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,700
the same channel s

450
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,729
with gamma King saw and

451
00:29:09,729 --> 00:29:13,599
not to be able just to work with
packages so don't

452
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:17,359
on aggravates the problem before there a
bus

453
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:21,200
little Buster cryptosystem hi Andy CPA

454
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,909
a robust system so cannot use the same
package that opens up into a gallant

455
00:29:26,909 --> 00:29:30,639
a and with with the context rice

456
00:29:30,639 --> 00:29:34,220
so that's it could be a good example so
than

457
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:38,389
you know this example so comparing
between

458
00:29:38,389 --> 00:29:41,590
between the real and southern

459
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:44,980
and the to mention one

460
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:52,810
circus this cover and

461
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:57,310
overlapping the gamut coloring

462
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:00,320
sir take for example a

463
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,110
so this the this block diagram

464
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:08,670
a this encryption system if someone

465
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:13,370
starts to sand so packages

466
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:16,720
so then the perpetrator can can't this
without iniki

467
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,960
and so this is all this

468
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,410
that that's certainly a so kills

469
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:26,410
all security issues and

470
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:30,980
proctor and this is this is the problem
that we needed to address

471
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:34,290
so partners face this issue

472
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:38,120
when we talk about in batting a so good
means

473
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,710
about by bad ways some so

474
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:46,170
net naturally when you implement this so
we

475
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:49,970
which act as issues and 78 to make sure

476
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:54,820
at this this works them hand

477
00:30:54,820 --> 00:31:02,200
another point size they are killed
killed

478
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,640
heavier Corp cryptography people

479
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,470
I know that you cannot use assault the

480
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:13,929
encryption 624 so 624

481
00:31:13,929 --> 00:31:19,960
a length a and more than 32 gigabytes of
information otherwise

482
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,309
so one that will adversely affect others

483
00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:27,540
nah no longer than sixty 624 bit key

484
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:33,040
can be used a device to be home alone
that and they're so turning a bikers

485
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,950
optimal

486
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:37,590
and a few wanted to do

487
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:42,120
to work to keep Araceli Santangelo
should be no more than seven

488
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:47,919
megabyte so the solutions exist to know
how to realize the keys how to word a

489
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,470
but there's a big problem so how to work
with it opens

490
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:56,200
haven't so they're still here no more
than ten megabytes per key

491
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:01,340
and and did it is why should or should
not

492
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:04,080
do it

493
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,900
so over the top of my head so when
they're just certify this and develop a

494
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,440
proper to standardize

495
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,410
to make sure that the system works and
to check it for robustness and

496
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:16,560
sustainability so such solutions

497
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:21,280
also the it take the key duplicated many
times

498
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:26,300
and then do the same thing Honda key
copies on their

499
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,430
and so the copy the key was just too

500
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:32,200
duplicated

501
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,530
regenerated and then

502
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:37,940
in our instructions we speak

503
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:44,470
about to so the key tree

504
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:49,320
implementation so it took time to put it
together but not works well

505
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,950
and not to generate a low-level key

506
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,960
some pictures so the speed

507
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,490
doesn't slow down but the realizations
more

508
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:06,330
difficult us we have for a selected
algorithms and their other conditions or

509
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:07,830
technical community and

510
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:11,020
so the keys have been analyzed hungary's
have been established

511
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:16,610
so how can your her should be related to
the authentification are not

512
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:19,750
because in real life too we can use

513
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:24,450
here not the hash functions so much but
if it hasn't im

514
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:28,370
combat here durability II or

515
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:32,710
reliability whoever related to so are

516
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:36,360
have defied can use the our signature

517
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:40,660
a ass as a second attempted to greater

518
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:44,050
and image Harper for the second image

519
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:47,080
so than her his is reduced

520
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:51,090
to had 22 a race to the power 120 I

521
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:57,290
and this which is only five orders of
magnitude yes as you know then that

522
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,280
should attack

523
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:02,160
related to the certificate so Microsoft
discussion still going on

524
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:06,470
so we don't know whether MD if I was
hacked or not and

525
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:10,030
might wonder what other so the main
problem is my someplace else

526
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:13,520
pain main challenges that

527
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,560
a few years this kind of system a

528
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,590
I sent a cold to assist our chess

529
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:25,520
signature Honda in the system

530
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,710
Windows system check

531
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:31,829
a silent cinema similar procedure

532
00:34:31,829 --> 00:34:37,859
with the variability of hunger is missus
use to buy microsoft from authentic old

533
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:42,679
Tucson some additional attributes a so
you do have a passion and a

534
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:46,710
so with a good it or behest on them

535
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:50,760
upside so the bottom tier hash

536
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:58,660
something crippled them on top it would
be cashed by a nice algorithm so where's

537
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,410
the kitch

538
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:04,480
the a one whole science has no issue

539
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,690
because the probability this store
scored can't be faked is so

540
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:13,780
next o0 so this

541
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:18,700
well has some properties absolutely a

542
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,359
on practical but her the

543
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:25,359
chicken party interests well

544
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,980
are is deceived because

545
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,140
at the he is given the wrong information

546
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:37,059
but which is sir and another thing so
with the practical

547
00:35:37,059 --> 00:35:40,140
attempt to build a manageable coalition

548
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:43,540
if we select

549
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:47,890
PDF orders review four-month with see

550
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:53,589
opportunity to compile whereby you can

551
00:35:53,589 --> 00:35:59,780
and scheck and replace well use a cell

552
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:03,430
if for Z create a collusion

553
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:08,059
those well you see you can create to
documents which

554
00:36:08,059 --> 00:36:12,859
will be reflected differently which is
unacceptable

555
00:36:12,859 --> 00:36:19,109
because

556
00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:22,720
PDF is permitted to use

557
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,849
and the

558
00:36:26,849 --> 00:36:33,059
in Russia legally you can only use 3
hash signatures the first here

559
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:39,839
is going to be them 20 whose

560
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:43,059
search standard so

561
00:36:43,059 --> 00:36:50,530
you europe-wide and then the last thing
I wanted to mention

562
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:54,079
is try to convince you

563
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,599
that many solution

564
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,200
pressure to not have any tag sir

565
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,170
and to there's no

566
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:08,549
KH and there is a good solution as a
author things

567
00:37:08,549 --> 00:37:12,849
Z

568
00:37:12,849 --> 00:37:16,369
most popular issues that's not done
discovered

569
00:37:16,369 --> 00:37:21,299
that us to disclose to

570
00:37:21,299 --> 00:37:24,970
at to be discussed among Creek
cryptogram first that Sam

571
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:28,270
that attack a to do with say

572
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:31,900
number schedule so there

573
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,220
locker is from for appoint was

574
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,640
known to and be souls it

575
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,140
tax that to mmm

576
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:46,529
the the to

577
00:37:46,529 --> 00:37:50,500
the a possible but and

578
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:57,039
there is an argument is that proves so
that's not it's not to

579
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:04,970
the only argument that's used solves a
parameter each candidate for the

580
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:05,779
parameters

581
00:38:05,779 --> 00:38:08,819
is calculated as a heshe from a random

582
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:13,930
line then you check and that their
parameters

583
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:20,460
comply if not to then you take a
different value

584
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:25,980
so if we believe in hash we believe in
parameters

585
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:30,180
because their structures

586
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:33,349
of cash and only taker kar

587
00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:36,480
are different you cannot compares them

588
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,480
so in our standards

589
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,710
russian standards in Ross standard to

590
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:46,369
we have that and that you can believe

591
00:38:46,369 --> 00:38:50,460
in our current some parameters and the
signature is this same

592
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,779
as that the American one you

593
00:38:53,779 --> 00:38:56,819
you cannot talk too much about it and

594
00:38:56,819 --> 00:39:04,329
them briefly I'll tell you for there is
a set of

595
00:39:04,329 --> 00:39:07,400
ways and algorithms and the functions

596
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,759
or from random data

597
00:39:10,759 --> 00:39:14,920
and diversification very

598
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,099
similar to the American ones

599
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:25,180
and thats if you don't like to use

600
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:30,900
and out-of-the-box solution this is a
recommendation to use our standards and

601
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,190
I

602
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:35,319
the second seed to in CM

603
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:40,220
ass and TLS and

604
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:43,640
there

605
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:47,260
the you can it can be used to am

606
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,350
the justifications have been provide

607
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:54,320
warm described by the standard

608
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,620
and them I will pass the floor to my
colleague about the practical

609
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:02,110
goals thank you

610
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:05,240
stanislaw I like

611
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:09,200
to tell you about that some practical

612
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,530
tasks the cryptographer citrus

613
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:16,050
when see develop protection

614
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:20,900
how the keys us more than one solutions
can be offered to businesses

615
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,400
how those keys are January

616
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,800
them these solutions can be embedded
into

617
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,070
MetLife system so let's start with

618
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:35,120
tasks so the bottleneck in any system
that

619
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,710
going to use Creek crystallography is
working with

620
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:42,190
toll comes and

621
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:47,480
sometimes you need to I'm conventional
solutions that will allow you to

622
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:53,230
minimize the number

623
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,930
use of such devices

624
00:40:54,930 --> 00:41:00,590
one signatures about this second so if
we have an operation like that an Afghan

625
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:04,280
eat computer resources

626
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,020
and other things and the Benz became bow
their

627
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:13,940
password to on one hand

628
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,430
you want to to make it safer

629
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:20,740
and ask password for each operation

630
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:23,820
remember me

631
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:26,830
we

632
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:30,220
life is different and

633
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:34,750
common user would be

634
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:37,810
using kids tools want

635
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:41,020
to see many offers

636
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:45,260
and they want to simplify this task them

637
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:50,020
cryptography is burden but not security

638
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:53,200
I'm something that act

639
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,240
is being forced on them

640
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:01,400
so not to lose the users who want to
support

641
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:05,530
these to them stew providing

642
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:08,570
the hi security

643
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:12,640
so speaking about synchronization

644
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,070
speaking about cryptography this

645
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:21,829
SES some laboring in memory that would
be

646
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:26,119
joining every encryption process and
every process

647
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:30,400
can work independently with different
container says so

648
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,559
someone is trying to create total do we

649
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:38,029
to open home your arrange it considering
that we have a bottleneck

650
00:42:38,029 --> 00:42:43,930
here are reading this smart cards and
Owen

651
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:47,719
Wiese speaking about different platforms

652
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:52,259
cryptography is algorithm

653
00:42:52,259 --> 00:42:55,900
to yet

654
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:59,809
to make it you need everything from your
PC to Windows XP

655
00:42:59,809 --> 00:43:03,519
that's where you need to consider
sinking

656
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:07,910
was absolutely different platforms

657
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:12,650
and them when you consider

658
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:16,729
dispatching space chains smart cards
remember

659
00:43:16,729 --> 00:43:22,549
protection keys and the difficulties
related

660
00:43:22,549 --> 00:43:27,469
so there are some simple considerations
that have been around for a long time

661
00:43:27,469 --> 00:43:33,170
with see hardware reliability weekend
completely

662
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:37,390
trust the network adapters weekend trust

663
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:39,109
dispatching

664
00:43:39,109 --> 00:43:42,119
memory and potentially some memory

665
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:45,650
week network for instance

666
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:53,930
take case similar where

667
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:57,620
three

668
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:58,870
get some address

669
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:04,870
space officer and use

670
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:09,080
and should the keys should never be kept

671
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,990
be used and

672
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:16,810
will never get them so

673
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:20,660
see activities will be masked modest

674
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:23,730
mosques in

675
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:27,520
so security here

676
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,510
the question as was mention

677
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:35,830
on tax third

678
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:45,130
our teacher need been

679
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:48,400
detected and multiplication

680
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:53,420
shop

681
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:57,220
we should so much the key

682
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:00,290
care as a key

683
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:03,750
part where you keep store keys

684
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:09,640
we have here many approaches in addition

685
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,650
Stanislaus when

686
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:17,280
be talking about keeping he said

687
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,160
stripes were in the filesystem

688
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,370
in there Windows register

689
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:31,390
do we need to support that but then
again speaking

690
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:33,610
users you'd

691
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:37,600
securities will be happy with KS

692
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,870
and naturally

693
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:44,850
evening protection in particular if they
don't want

694
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:50,560
if they want

695
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,700
restrict the number of password guess

696
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:57,420
you can

697
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:01,530
commander a solution different from her
first try

698
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:05,710
Eve you import around password there
would be

699
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:14,320
walk and active are absolutely identical
in terms of security

700
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:18,370
past as perpetrator

701
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:21,520
cams traffic between machine and

702
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,460
car so there's no difference if you
steal

703
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:29,000
freaky or if he steals the password

704
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,720
and next transaction just science a
million-dollar

705
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:37,300
payment order but to focus can be used

706
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:40,310
for extension and additional

707
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:42,329
themselves

708
00:46:42,329 --> 00:46:47,739
somewhat raises the security one of the
approaches is expanding

709
00:46:47,739 --> 00:46:50,809
chi or metric tokens

710
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:56,289
when we and some additional

711
00:46:56,289 --> 00:47:00,229
authentication factor and after 3 p.m.

712
00:47:00,229 --> 00:47:05,439
he needs to somehow the operation at the
top

713
00:47:05,439 --> 00:47:09,479
and the benefits are if you will see a

714
00:47:09,479 --> 00:47:13,109
p.m. colder the perpetrator can do
nothing with it

715
00:47:13,109 --> 00:47:16,989
because he will need

716
00:47:16,989 --> 00:47:20,189
so input any some confirmation

717
00:47:20,189 --> 00:47:24,739
it can be used in addition in

718
00:47:24,739 --> 00:47:29,779
existing system them downsides

719
00:47:29,779 --> 00:47:43,779
the architect because you need to
consider that with turning to the toll

720
00:47:43,779 --> 00:47:48,439
Senate waiting is doing something the
user can

721
00:47:48,439 --> 00:47:52,710
do we with that

722
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:55,970
so these issues that you need dress

723
00:47:55,970 --> 00:48:00,549
and then mmm as it software

724
00:48:00,549 --> 00:48:03,940
in the talk comes can be quite
complicated

725
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:07,440
and verification cam be

726
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,740
quite cumbersome so is a protected
exchange

727
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:17,339
approach so we have some channel

728
00:48:17,339 --> 00:48:24,039
it's compromised and

729
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:27,460
for instance a someone has already broke

730
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:30,970
packed and is a number prop

731
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:34,180
you to get three of such perpetrators

732
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:38,390
this conference we were talking about
them once we don't want to use

733
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:39,990
additional protocols

734
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:43,480
for indirection was dorgan's and work
somehow

735
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:48,970
in a conventional manner so we can use
it

736
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:52,000
another which with

737
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,089
a special dedicated servers so the so
now we have three

738
00:48:56,089 --> 00:48:59,799
I'm stakeholders you

739
00:48:59,799 --> 00:49:03,339
the user and someone and the server and
the user

740
00:49:03,339 --> 00:49:06,559
asks their servers that he wants to work

741
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,759
with them car than the computer will

742
00:49:09,759 --> 00:49:13,190
send worries to a smart card on this
server

743
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:17,230
and after some kind of double sided
authentication

744
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:20,319
according to article similar to

745
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:24,130
I'm some simplest answer tópico

746
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:28,250
certificates in a simpler form CB
certificate

747
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:31,940
after this exchange

748
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:36,259
and protected connection

749
00:49:36,259 --> 00:49:47,069
the server will get some unique
information

750
00:49:47,069 --> 00:49:50,019
will provide certificate for the
computer

751
00:49:50,019 --> 00:49:54,029
and star interacting with a double

752
00:49:54,029 --> 00:49:58,739
was the authentication through to
protect the channel

753
00:49:58,739 --> 00:50:07,910
where you can send files and signatures
this approach is very popular

754
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:11,160
in particular it's yours

755
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:14,289
in the Univercell trying cards

756
00:50:14,289 --> 00:50:17,950
judging by his own leaders conferences

757
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:21,979
it will be used in the electronic
passports that we are going

758
00:50:21,979 --> 00:50:25,619
to gets on are so very quite high

759
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:29,059
level of security that it provides and
the protocols

760
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:33,190
is quite are quite simple you don't need
to change them

761
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:36,519
so that downside to need this server
unit

762
00:50:36,519 --> 00:50:39,910
access to the server and

763
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:45,960
yes you have error so once they broker

764
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,049
see common user cannot

765
00:50:49,049 --> 00:50:52,200
handle them even though sometimes

766
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:58,160
Mar S IV user can

767
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:03,050
be quite you know in in a difficult is
so if we want to use

768
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:07,300
active tokens was out any specific
protocols

769
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:11,510
we could use additional tool our
security

770
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:15,110
in particular is a protected readers
which are very

771
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:18,540
simple we consider four sides

772
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:22,100
you sir computer the reader and a smart
card

773
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:25,360
warriors beat talk on which one to be

774
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:29,700
inserted in their readers the user will
send a document to be signed

775
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:35,500
we will be hashed think computer will
send to the document

776
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:38,550
number you

777
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:42,340
the hash will go to the reader to reader
will compare their

778
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:46,260
hash from D document it was

779
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:49,410
see incoming cash if for it may choose

780
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:55,070
them you can show show it on the display
you with the question

781
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:59,760
if you want to cited easy for the user
says yes that goes to the smart card and

782
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,440
gets back

783
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:05,760
so it looks for approximately like that

784
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,330
a user will send a payment order it will
shown he

785
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:13,430
will be shown here and so even it if

786
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:19,930
p.m. is stolen so say abstract security
level is high the user can always say no

787
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:22,439
but but menu

788
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:26,900
you cannot always to realize so you
can't do that

789
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:30,239
with this smartphone for instance if
there is a solution

790
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:36,249
and on your smartphone you keep the
secret key and then they

791
00:52:36,249 --> 00:52:40,349
their protected connection would be
established and someday there will be

792
00:52:40,349 --> 00:52:42,229
sent them the user will sign

793
00:52:42,229 --> 00:52:46,589
in case there is the service station

794
00:52:46,589 --> 00:52:50,339
it will approx min to look this way so
the user

795
00:52:50,339 --> 00:52:54,319
will make a decision if he's going to
sign it or not to solve it

796
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:59,890
random numbers generator Eve for you are
familiar with cryptography you know

797
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:03,299
about the generation of random numbers
so

798
00:53:03,299 --> 00:53:08,989
again just like all racer when you're
embed this system

799
00:53:08,989 --> 00:53:14,680
so why should we invent something you
why don't we take an existing solution

800
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,930
late Sen consider say

801
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:22,439
Western solutions so first the generator
that stanislaw for was a

802
00:53:22,439 --> 00:53:26,420
looking one and be Nana page 10

803
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:29,900
male for promoting and birther

804
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:34,009
was very questionable in per Intel
secure care

805
00:53:34,009 --> 00:53:37,099
we immediately are

806
00:53:37,099 --> 00:53:37,830
E

807
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:41,610
it is potentially subject to hardware
Troy yarns

808
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:46,080
which can easily reach you

809
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:49,320
reduce answer P offers a sequences

810
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:54,040
and the Windows Linux for appropriate or
the entropy

811
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:57,260
is absolutely on

812
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:01,980
grounded mmm and I cannot tell you about
but looks like a

813
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:05,530
is going to work so the Russian
developers can

814
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:10,580
for several generators which

815
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,960
with different approaches sir hardware

816
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:17,710
mmm get a chance that you can just

817
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:21,740
use an answer biological catcher and

818
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:26,010
the interaction with the user the

819
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:29,440
but they're not they have low speed and

820
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:34,510
I'm not applicable in every architecture
so we're still searching

821
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:38,590
and we heard her or presentations

822
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:42,650
for gadgets as such gadgets at a recent
conference says

823
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:48,510
and admitting at that time so good with
how are we going to embed in rail system

824
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:49,000
how

825
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,250
can we start using russian cryptography
well

826
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:55,900
not much trouble because it's out of the
box

827
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:59,290
almost out of the box let's talk about
Windows

828
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:03,090
when you stole my breweries EU

829
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:09,599
will have from

830
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,259
outlook encryption and the signature

831
00:55:12,259 --> 00:55:15,269
and that document in Microsoft Word
Excel

832
00:55:15,269 --> 00:55:18,660
anther authentication

833
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:22,269
through win logo on for smart card will
work on the local

834
00:55:22,269 --> 00:55:25,999
machine which is safe and

835
00:55:25,999 --> 00:55:30,140
comfortable toos will work

836
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:33,700
through this standard

837
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:37,200
interfaces and any user once

838
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:42,249
to have good tois will

839
00:55:42,249 --> 00:55:46,190
have the Russian algorithm so I guess
it's all

840
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:51,019
available because Microsoft Windows has
module liberate take render

841
00:55:51,019 --> 00:55:54,249
been repent but Bendtner we just a
conecto

842
00:55:54,249 --> 00:55:58,390
laborers and any implication can easily
use the local algorithm

843
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:01,869
and SPI interface where

844
00:56:01,869 --> 00:56:06,670
you can use any security protocols what
about UNIX

845
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:09,780
so

846
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:13,070
Ribery's like over nasa Salam the
breasts SL

847
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:16,410
have support you can use them and

848
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:19,610
include in up archer and

849
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:25,150
it can be questionable but they're

850
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:29,340
expendable and a you can write your own
and Jim

851
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:32,360
said and some vendors have them already

852
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,580
and here

853
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:38,670
you can right

854
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:41,850
one called for Windows with script I P

855
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:44,910
it will be identical for UNIX

856
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:50,760
but for rap to you need some processor
because Microsoft is on from the book

857
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:55,700
units doesn't have it and there are two
considerations here you can

858
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:59,390
either do it or get there are 81

859
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:02,850
for instance cop who might libraries
that does it

860
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:06,450
how does it work

861
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:10,260
their script I P a person who

862
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:15,300
starts to look at it will see you there
there's a huge number of functions when

863
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,160
they can

864
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:20,220
the breakdown into to Classico

865
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:23,660
mmm complaining basic functions

866
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:28,369
and Pavia functions that L

867
00:57:28,369 --> 00:57:31,680
to use short methods to address many
tasks

868
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:37,819
and their allows you to sign

869
00:57:37,819 --> 00:57:42,839
with your Keith some some some message
even 10 is not very

870
00:57:42,839 --> 00:57:46,380
difficult to use him that's the way you
can now

871
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:49,779
and deploy easy diffie-hellman protocol

872
00:57:49,779 --> 00:57:54,460
on 42 users first alice is getting her
open key you

873
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:57,650
then Bob is doing the same thing

874
00:57:57,650 --> 00:58:02,599
and then our sample import open

875
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:07,109
keys of each other and then as exchange

876
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:10,410
key is

877
00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:13,880
20 847 and them

878
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:21,160
algorithm them these keys can be used
for encrypting

879
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:24,720
is this session and further activity

880
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:29,460
is so

881
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:32,840
as aris a.m.

882
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:36,600
some deficiency Internet Explorer

883
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:41,960
does not cause many issues because it
works through out of the box

884
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:45,000
face be working

885
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,250
set of and crime

886
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:55,470
can use Russian because

887
00:58:55,470 --> 00:59:02,050
the box you need to support

888
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:05,490
great can

889
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:08,640
games order

890
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:12,420
browsers be so

891
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:16,800
parties cactus that you can use

892
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:20,230
where

893
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:54,260
I thank you attention

894
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:57,340
his column to

895
00:59:57,340 --> 01:00:02,830
Russian which

896
01:00:02,830 --> 01:00:12,800
reduces to simple

897
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:16,170
yes yes

898
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:21,130
from their abilities fear but we don't
short

899
01:00:21,130 --> 01:00:27,230
version these attacks

900
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:30,400
are not applicable in russia because

901
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:37,120
in 2010 we didn't have the script made
in 2005 the

902
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:43,890
any sure key options you can

903
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:47,360
reduce some no

904
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:50,620
is not in in now

905
01:00:50,620 --> 01:01:02,860
is not an option is up

906
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:03,980
thank you that's it
