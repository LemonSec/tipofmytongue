opportunity was he will probably lose
you choose you

33
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:12,780
so the teacher which homework solution

Cotton Bowl City movie william

00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,639
move would you street use whose

47
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:06,510
we're just losing the support piers new
more a solution you move

48
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,730
bricks with you done in this the

49
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,800
joke we both liked hit

50
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,120
know where this might come in handy

51
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,380
him

52
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,910
cue who'll as you personally

53
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,430
yes he probably hold

54
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,920
any excess to resource in that sort

55
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,160
must firstly four-shot felt eyes

56
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,980
for access privileges however it can
easily happen

57
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,150
its such a validation is absent from the
Cubs

58
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,260
him or in fact

59
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:49,950
access rights system is faulty

60
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:55,320
saying in essence you realize it's
important to do be kind to those

61
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,470
example the project is over

62
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,040
for the developers feel to include all
the necessary checks

63
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,820
some Tomic be highly critical sister

64
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:14,340
Lee is simply cannot much the codes
alternatively

65
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,560
old you might wanna

66
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,160
developer better system for access
rights management

67
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,350
insured

68
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,850
the system is already running in
production belt

69
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:32,530
we might remember not initially
knowledge base excess responsible

70
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,199
systems where you so early where replace
with the role they systems

71
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:39,760
schools and over told

72
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,680
it was a stream of publications search
shows how you could actually

73
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,860
build role based system all total

74
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,590
man died the system used

75
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:55,220
which essentially means its own all
invasive approach to have all your bill

76
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,560
it's irrelevant

77
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,560
removal sorry has been around for quite
some time way you can actually

78
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,970
protection self

79
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,479
from data manipulation LCS arrest
attacks it

80
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:16,430
under case him

81
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,540
also on Monday

82
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:24,450
is as follows: we are a go to locals

83
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:28,650
real show this to lose will essentially
be known as a civil

84
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,950
my presentation researcher in

85
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:37,450
were parser for schools have a look at
the terminology that a little to the

86
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,910
service I client-side

87
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,110
early implementation issues the

88
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:46,780
all hip

89
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,000
I'll start with a couple terminals a
slow so make sure you speak the same

90
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,700
language

91
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:55,110
moved so

92
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,440
authorization for access control will be
used

93
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,970
interchangeably in this presentation and
as he is a

94
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,700
their simple opposition is Chris persons

95
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,900
specific user and password doesn't have
access to particular resource

96
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:15,410
heap love the long the underlying
principles here is her full

97
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,560
intermediation

98
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,140
which way so as well trying to dollar
diet

99
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,460
check the authorizations over every
access instance

100
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,000
every user to any party resource

101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,210
hit

102
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:36,120
who hears a who world

103
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,130
look as health sector 1 and other plus
was work

104
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,580
you realize how we usually have little
sister developers

105
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,370
thing yet summer authorize a shindig
natal

106
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:50,250
Houlihan curse simply put force their
way it

107
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:57,680
you was hook

108
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,870
so they're up for policies available
they're all shows lawyers

109
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,670
please know that sir just

110
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:09,360
contributed that repeal based access
control lists the approach that is

111
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,360
essentially

112
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,490
see a lot of development so for several
years

113
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,080
baton on the underlying anti

114
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,270
here so you can actually scrub pretty
much

115
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:24,560
things like that in most cases you'll
see

116
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:33,990
that role-based access systems years

117
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,900
huge

118
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:42,350
world

119
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:46,890
and d be an ass he usually you provide
to our mandate based

120
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:50,640
access control which is actually means
he control information flows

121
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,740
systems and

122
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,920
Russian computer security mandate based
access control this little different

123
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,030
lets you fine-tune

124
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,070
on the country's in most cases

125
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:07,660
d covers callback or

126
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:12,060
similar approach this shellac schedule
based on grades

127
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,920
and

128
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,630
this which was a he released your
pre-tax him sorry to protect the system

129
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,370
from

130
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:25,390
top top-down at I collectors

131
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:32,099
wouldn't

132
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:35,099
him let these very simple here

133
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:38,979
a subject that or healers

134
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:42,779
have fun an old religious lol successor
should

135
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:47,980
north's be able to recent that requires
higher privileges in the system

136
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,970
to please not only for size and here

137
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:56,700
to select going to discuss in much more
detail later whatever

138
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,200
access control system you're using or
whatever policy

139
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,970
using all answers must be properly
verified and identified

140
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:09,410
as long as he hadn't done art year know
the leader illusions

141
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:17,470
access control hit a lot worse of
security levels

142
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,830
is also important to have who

143
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:26,960
keep you

144
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,240
that the user can access an entity

145
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,980
is and only if he has the right
privileges

146
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:39,540
the most importantly human that's why
I'm stressing it so much a teaser

147
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:43,060
peculiarity of the Russian approach to
information security

148
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,290
so the system polymers

149
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,190
cheese rick's president should not
really experience

150
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,800
in the AM the legal total close

151
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:59,440
who who

152
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,820
whenever we the talk about such an
approach developers for some reason

153
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,490
Linda

154
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:09,130
instantly turn to lol about a little
more toned and it's pretty difficult to

155
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:09,980
explain

156
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:14,800
their production a predisposition to
peel be was to build back 97 test for a

157
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,959
particular system

158
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:19,450
he has been showing over this the case
to be pretty weak

159
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,310
free

160
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:25,300
buggy birds have artist who uses the
bell about a little

161
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:33,160
for for a number of times we climbed to
its

162
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,590
the launch more orderly and much more
reliable

163
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:40,210
systems thoughts wills that would
support at least

164
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:43,440
been much more secure installation

165
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,310
but to no avail who his

166
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:54,310
him there is a huge

167
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:57,980
platform quarterbacks is actually runs

168
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,380
call he much mobile security forces

169
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,420
dank claims that sir bill a bottle is
officially simple static

170
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,650
intentionally overall great he's

171
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:12,660
and certainly we see that the years
fixed a BLT

172
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,140
will in fact fix a deal the if his
search for it on the web

173
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,990
me alone defiant who is consistently its
effect

174
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:25,030
fixed bilby is a Dell Windows version of
the LPI

175
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:29,950
the other was years in the very first
publication of bill

176
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:35,790
and little hold back when

177
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:39,970
they went experimenting where the
baltics operating system

178
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,420
so then see if that foster

179
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,970
he is Rick the two guests redraw its

180
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,130
to all the resources for within

181
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:54,940
she's to mandate so to speak however it
was only able to

182
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,110
used forces right

183
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,790
on us essentially or sporty his

184
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:07,250
clearance little for example have
confidential or secret files

185
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:12,020
sorry he has consulted on show access
rights claims that he can read

186
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,310
confidential and everything billows his

187
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:20,690
but interestingly he can only overly
earlier right data into the followers of

188
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,190
his particular level

189
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:26,690
in our case confidential board

190
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:29,970
it's pretty easy is it implement

191
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:33,790
the kissa that's later me too so many
additional checks

192
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,950
she however

193
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:40,680
thats terms to constrain the
functionality of all the processes in

194
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,360
the system

195
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,920
him and this is who we are going to say
in this list aerobics rules

196
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:52,160
he'll see

197
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,260
this is important to observe the rule of

198
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,760
session loved paying a call to

199
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,240
thinkin operation right which is closing
in the aerobic spaniel here

200
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,440
who see

201
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:14,040
hidden so interestingly Oracle a little
ass

202
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,440
has sold the same approach she

203
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,730
that's exactly what you see here this is
the read excess

204
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:26,199
changed his school

205
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:30,480
his while sitting in here you that the
system checks

206
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,970
where their who

207
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:38,750
theory operation you're trying to
perform force within the strict confines

208
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,850
opium and eight

209
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:43,589
want all security BMS

210
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:46,610
are essentially fixed on Bell the title
a model

211
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:49,800
school it's important to remember

212
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,699
the 40 hold or sell shares very rarely
distraught

213
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:58,790
here his

214
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:02,449
which means we don't really know which
particular

215
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:12,649
pillars particulars as basil initially
had a DBMS as a usually do not provide a

216
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:15,130
PO itself enable us to implement

217
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:18,620
overall rules him

218
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:23,279
the worst possibly nablas steel great
theory access control systems

219
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,579
I'm mentioning it because in other
systems he can actually get this API

220
00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:31,670
it's fairly DBMSs forget it's not
available

221
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,790
all developers can obviously develop
their own API's

222
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:39,009
him but its

223
00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:42,790
it is not really plaudits poly
contenders

224
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:46,230
speak now let's take a look

225
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,930
to what is going to happen if

226
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,769
sold you really really holds

227
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:57,360
to implement here all access control
policies on

228
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,579
DBMS and we have the following
constraints we can change in

229
00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:02,660
infrastructure we can change the source
code

230
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,649
who and laws go into develop and you

231
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:11,399
service table so whilst or additional
data so we are going into performer its

232
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:22,339
in unknown invasive managed snow here
where dole in talking about sir

233
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:26,110
database management system says we'll
head out for some web service

234
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,620
functionality as well

235
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:33,279
so we're going to consider a two
different cases here long will be an ass

236
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:33,959
kill

237
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:37,470
database last day will be mine single
and the other

238
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:43,019
implementation like the your skill
system with a REST API

239
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:46,699
could be less text search color whatever
peyot 8

240
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:53,519
who attack

241
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,439
there are teas actress we can follow
weekend either

242
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:01,180
the to its it

243
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,370
I'm sorry on a little subtle denies data

244
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:08,100
rotor or low-dose ruth has the info all

245
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,880
you stand a week ago the way a framework
sir finals

246
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,720
who

247
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,750
usual in DBMS

248
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:24,720
his the right number of other

249
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,180
known approaches just were

250
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:32,089
non-invasive implementation reno scale
for example

251
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:35,110
axiomatic sir the well-known solutions

252
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:38,880
like but let me explain

253
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,800
bloody what is a the novelty that a
break here because and all the

254
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,260
approaches you see on the screen

255
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:48,630
the I there are based on access control
lists

256
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:52,500
and if I will based SQL injection
protection

257
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,149
no our approach is to show how you can
actually provide

258
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:03,100
mandate based access control he

259
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,230
shoe who moved

260
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,959
and how you can actually

261
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:17,329
make invisible to web applications Gould

262
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:21,819
which see here is a classification a
wholly pro-choice he saw in the previous

263
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:22,500
laws

264
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,980
no the clustered oh they're

265
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,940
to different buckets depending on which
part of the system

266
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:39,360
their address who

267
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,559
who worked on the possible
implementations he

268
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:50,090
we toyed with several ideas and what do
they really can show insurance card and

269
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:54,550
you have to agree that most this
mattress will tend to be quite difficult

270
00:17:54,550 --> 00:18:00,080
to mount if you don't have a huge team
of developers who will know the source

271
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,160
code very well it will have an in-depth
understanding almost to the devices

272
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,940
but chances are you'll be successful
there is another major issue here

273
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,280
in many cases

274
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,210
people don't really understand properly
what mandated by East Texas

275
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,150
Comptroller's

276
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:21,760
because usually his only confined to
give

277
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,840
pretty you soldiers three words track

278
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,000
first tax this is this were to labels

279
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,130
I'm sorry and please remember as we said
previously

280
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:36,990
all the answers on the system must be
identified and verified

281
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:41,960
which means I if you tried to access
control at the level of DBMS

282
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,130
socially means that the minnow unitaf

283
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:52,500
date and dressing is all where you can
provide service access controlled

284
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,730
out Camire Pascale a

285
00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:00,070
enables you to address columns but not
rose

286
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:04,900
let alone individual cells a literate

287
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,640
similar DBMSs enable you to address
individual cells

288
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,779
means I'll take you

289
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:18,830
rule maneuver 10 to say was that a your
access control

290
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:22,559
whose for medical this is Victoria

291
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,960
Assets Control lower will mostly be
limited by the structural

292
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,750
to be a mess force

293
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:34,860
whose to our approach is that's where

294
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:40,460
billion to the stylish proxy server
that's where we'll

295
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,570
me its streets access control policy

296
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:49,090
know we'll be right of super proxy
server and we also need to learn how to

297
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:53,470
properly most I'd ticket authorize a
user's

298
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:57,409
whose

299
00:19:57,409 --> 00:20:00,639
you usually at the level of the

300
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:04,169
TB mas requests calls from different

301
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:07,559
each user's adults distinguishable

302
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:10,919
will you so

303
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,460
oooh hafer access control policy
implemented a it

304
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:19,460
role days mandate based on a hybrid all
the requests

305
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:26,019
well come in a jungle from the viewpoint
of the DBMS they will

306
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:31,200
all look like coming from the same user
so it's very important for us

307
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,320
educate the proxy server home

308
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,299
he can actually who identified
distinguished users

309
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:42,840
on this a little differently for us
Kayla

310
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:51,890
members killed database here

311
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:59,950
good no skill databases

312
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:04,750
and some searchable systems we can have
a REST API

313
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:09,140
Wellfleet works as I will have a ser
sorry will have a clogged

314
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,490
servers was his and discusses

315
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:16,320
like this with the label E is to century
class

316
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,790
saw your java scripts for different
clips so in your HTTP requests

317
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:27,910
as you'll see from the start you look at
us like this for example

318
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:30,990
this is what return requests can look
like

319
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,460
weird

320
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,090
people that way Yuki is an
application-level Charles

321
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:42,210
support sessions here

322
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:45,380
and any chips most

323
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:51,090
3,000 steel rails wears hearing that we
have a lot here's a nice

324
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:55,470
I'll or load balancer which means a
users have already gone through

325
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:58,780
authentication process there so it's
pretty easy

326
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:02,240
to at a user ID

327
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,790
from load balancer for example and a
little approx this year

328
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:09,460
slits can at least distinguish between
requests coming from different users

329
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:14,570
who suffer such a test infrastructure
pretty simple to citrus Ranch he have to

330
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:15,190
agree

331
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:19,000
we have all these requests coming

332
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,159
through the load balancer

333
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:29,080
and this isn't that this is indeed a
very simple example we are using at the

334
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,580
IP device here which

335
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:34,539
has a an idea I really interface the set

336
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:40,100
TCAL language extension and enables here
to address

337
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,330
all the old jets there are failing
available on this device

338
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:48,899
felt that way you can run pretty much
any logic you want say civil there is an

339
00:22:48,899 --> 00:22:50,279
issue with checking whether

340
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:53,760
session exists and that always simply at
the

341
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,870
his RIT into the HTTP request

342
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:00,820
world and now we can easily

343
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:04,690
around easily or more execuse

344
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:10,289
security policy have a running on the
proxy server all that particular request

345
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:14,059
as well will only eat to Toys R Us will

346
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:18,330
to reverse proxy for us all

347
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:22,130
real excess which is going to provide us
with all the

348
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:26,860
labels last year's he could be car
protected directory or some internal

349
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,480
data warehouse used

350
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,840
now when you've learnt holdouts

351
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,240
it's pretty easy to apply all their
security rules and policies

352
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,620
you wishful

353
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:45,270
first knows will at this was gonna look
like for a pretty simple toned down a

354
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,270
REST API

355
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:49,549
firstly check whether he is or has been
authenticated its

356
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:54,450
not to thats we get a user's ID cool

357
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:59,429
and bass on his ID alias search his
clearance

358
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:02,160
after yard

359
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,980
we parse the URL which tackle whether
the user's clearance

360
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:11,550
Nationals the level of the particular
object he requests

361
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:15,760
he for a chippy requires

362
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,730
this notion also whole

363
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:23,350
request is slightly different bushel
following in entebbe mass

364
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:29,850
were all yes his

365
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:34,280
effects its easy route to that's when
you're dealing with HTTP requests

366
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:40,170
as the cold show solicit just here is
essentially a weight

367
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:44,270
fix the from the National a share with
the a little immortal

368
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:47,730
the this you will

369
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:53,880
dying slowly our own proxy server we are
able to simulate a proper Outback

370
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,140
policy you who CPU say

371
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:01,110
if we have the user who has secret level
clearance

372
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:07,100
each secret level access this meeting so
he is allowed to read all the files on

373
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:07,770
the system

374
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:12,010
in fact if he hasn't already

375
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,400
anything is allowed to write any data
off

376
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,430
any level however after his read
something

377
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:23,720
she saw reelection built within the
confines of the secret level he can no

378
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,290
longer write files

379
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:29,990
have any other clearance world when his
session is over

380
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:34,570
whole thing is refreshed spaghetti right
and his low score read it

381
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:39,160
whose you both out if we're using a
skill system such as

382
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,260
my signal it's very important for us

383
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:46,060
from there beginning to identify the
user's so we

384
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:49,610
piracy was your way using a load
balancers because

385
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:53,040
as quel requests are created

386
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,110
at the server level in early

387
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:59,200
sent to the DBMS earlier which means
that we can't really gets

388
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,000
who the attributes we had in the
previous example

389
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,590
so the way %eh

390
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:11,400
the worker who is out we need to develop
a more chill for the framework

391
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,070
skill into intercepts the request and

392
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:19,990
tents to the request some user ID of for
example

393
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:23,020
he can at patent

394
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:27,100
address session ID or he is raising as a
call and

395
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:31,220
in front believe vs killer requests old

396
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:35,690
little dung-wei this security monitor on
the reverse proxy

397
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:40,760
the old will be able to understand who
is

398
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:50,669
requests he was sort of information the

399
00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:54,049
so cold croat operations

400
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:59,740
you they'll be pretty easy to perform
like that's because the tools

401
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:03,090
really require pennies talked

402
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:06,990
bottle flows of information old usually

403
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:10,960
flows like this will only be triggers
many have in that it square is like

404
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,750
that's you

405
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,840
clean again

406
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,460
he is cursors leaders or triggers

407
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:25,490
to get around it LA showing how he could
actually be done with cursor flows or

408
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:29,669
in that it requests so push

409
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:34,140
his now the easiest approach

410
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:39,260
as you see here is so the one that helps
the deal simpler than that its clearance

411
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,790
him to lie and say it's nuts who

412
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:47,720
seems we have user ID is who

413
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:52,810
and you I'm sorry since doesn't come as
part of their requests we need to parse

414
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:53,620
it first

415
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:58,910
well check the validity internally who

416
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:03,680
the it would be more complicated to
analyze individual routines

417
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,820
this is something that we haven't really
analyzed

418
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:10,220
as we understand that static analysis
who

419
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:15,930
tools could actually be useful pic is it
that way we would be able to learn who

420
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,900
actually sandwich procedures

421
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,900
kind of Los the triggers we believe it
could be done

422
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:31,650
but this is something we have not
performed yet

423
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:34,990
of pollution

424
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:38,350
Marchesa want to it him

425
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:43,110
who who

426
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:49,770
groovy to now in the SQL query in the
historic last week and also

427
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,780
integrates a real es for daytime

428
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:59,540
wouldn't we know that an attacker for
example Charlie changing the NZ here

429
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,860
in order to get the date on the user's

430
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:08,300
so give with me reduce on this request

431
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,750
by attending our own User ID in front of
it

432
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,890
we cover this vulnerability completely

433
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,980
we to him

434
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:23,200
who

435
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,070
you will no this was a fine all invasive

436
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:30,620
access control for protecting TPMS

437
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:36,080
level you now let's look at the web
server side

438
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,440
picture

439
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:43,090
who he

440
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:47,080
you any highly secure about applications

441
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,180
it's important

442
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:53,680
to protect the workflows his

443
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:58,650
now I'm referencing a particular
publication here that shows

444
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:02,690
workflow protection although it starts
hurts

445
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:06,030
is not really provided anywhere

446
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:09,100
also elves losses trailers

447
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,910

448
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:16,990
miles web applications that are socially
base

449
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:21,180
workflows have this series on our
ability she

450
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,490
was also

451
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:27,540
and a lost top 10

452
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:31,100
his people known vulnerability when you
have

453
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,480
indirect links whose

454
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,600
what other known approaches to

455
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,550
resolving or removing yes well-known
older pills

456
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:45,910
for seeking used to convey success who

457
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:49,200
if a web application

458
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,030
informal generates file name:

459
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:57,700
or name pictures something through it

460
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:01,230
each to who

461
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,190
he

she's and display so the state employees

463
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:10,980
in HTML we can actually eat

calculating how much at last play
replacing the hash

00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:23,270
alone the application firewall will
check list

467

can exist through doesn't whose off at
Wishaw issues

468
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:32,340
that could be over its heels move
reaches the new

469
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:37,390
attack surface considerably and this is
what somewhat security number of other

470
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,080
short

471

who

please tell the same approach can
actually be a similar to results home

474
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,470
for her abilities and access control

475
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:57,490
you for example if a web server
generates some

476
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:01,950
heidi's times train resource ladies

477

speakeasies you any

481

00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:33,050
have who well it's important for us to

484
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:37,230
tease on this string properly

485
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:41,000
to make sure that it's fuel injector
itself prone to injections

486
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,730
shooter then we can run the ash

487
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,320
action using a secret key there are two
protocols that are available

488
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,780
the key is social wise or session less

489
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:58,309
caught a cold full

490
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:03,230
essentially we can run it in a way that
would make sure that no data is

491
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:06,580
physically stored in the Tyrol up

492
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:11,960
hit

493
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:16,370
massage implementation he you can pre
sales

494
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:21,970
CS around as well as replant turks as
well as a number if not all

495
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:28,390
workflow attacks yes and also

496
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:31,570
enables to protection as hell big gains

497
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:35,919
it. many relationship

498
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,809
who can actually be implemented on

499
00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:43,900
hybrids and walks

500
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:47,000
nice for a close as well as modular
trailers for Django

501
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,320
whose shows

502
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:55,760
he a list I was distraught

503
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,040
you can be clay gets for protecting HTML
elements

504
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:05,970
and for protections Hill some reason
nobody has a research whether saying

505
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:07,780
were deployed to cook his

506
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:11,790
and here where cold singing trust way
spider loves blog

507
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:14,879
and these are the guys that are
supporting what security and no not the

508
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:15,629
default

509
00:34:15,629 --> 00:34:19,399
demand sleep promoting and developing it

510
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:22,429
so PE see what they say here

511
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:26,810
they've implemented this works his like
a charm

512
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:33,389
although they are experiencing some
cookie data issues

513
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:35,510
well I can assure you that our students

514
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:42,639
ish have looked into that and they've
shown conclusively that's a cookie

515
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,600
protection protocol like this could
easily be construed to see

516
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,679
so for every controlled coqui

517
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,159
if all the awards is to control the
caucus

518
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:56,399
all you need to do is create miracle
cream

519
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,790
he'll simply check don't

520
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:05,560
know they say the same if you also want
to control cookies scope

521
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,920
we should cover the domains where you
can go

522
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,010
it's tragic to rate its life

523
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:16,540
well done he will need to develop more
difficult course tracks

524
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:20,280
essentially that would be needed authors
conclude that will contain all the

525
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:20,850
stator

526
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:26,109
enough so that's she people this coke is
with all their value this

527
00:35:26,109 --> 00:35:29,680
should just say where he also

528
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,500
add to their hash based on this session
key

529
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:37,859
for the device for user you

530
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:42,030
and that's way you can make sure that
all the client-side

531
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:46,869
is better clinical case can also be
Cumberland just

532
00:35:46,869 --> 00:35:48,260
you

533
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:53,540
his or to if we'll see if there is a
discrepancy between the cookie store

534
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,570
internally

535
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:58,610
kid I guess generators you can for
example cancel a suction

536
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:08,270
delete all too late and so on least
weekly popular

537
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:11,530
previously was that he is a rolls

538
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:15,860
I would be assigned fire Co kiss his

539
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:20,330
or for example you could get a cookie
saying and Yankee iraq such officer

540
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:23,550
those a regular user world now if

541
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:26,660
in the web browser you fake cocaine

542
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:30,040
he can easily become an admin will

543
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:34,130
than is signed the cooking like that's

544
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:39,920
the national problems stays on in the
cult

545
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,490
the vulnerabilities cold

546
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:48,680
well the office price you pay for the
art is that he and now I have

547
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:54,340
twice as many cookies

548
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:59,349
hitch there is one more thing I want to
discuss

549
00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:03,130
which was a hola go into control

550
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:12,160
the workflow processes used tourism
particular string operations you need to

551
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:12,950
perform another

552
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:17,150
save both but BOCONI on Amazon whatever

553
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:20,859
the first select the product

554
00:37:20,859 --> 00:37:23,920
many countries or patron diesem

555
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:29,020
no layoffs about download the book well

556
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:33,599
if you find a way to download the book
straightaway he most cases maynes

557
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,900
successfully tax the work clothes mean

558
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,900
the notion of workflow whose

559
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:44,170
has recently been has very well
formulators

560
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:49,359
in identity-based cryptography the prior
stellar definition for

561
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:53,180
cryptographic workflow who

562
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:57,290
the only problem we have

563
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:00,310
he starts is based on colour sec

564
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:04,640
cryptographic choice if you want to
perform but the only to do its

565
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,950
on your browser relying on JavaScript

566
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:12,450
probably a base cryptography

567
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:16,369
is still the most potent me in the
jury's still out on whether it's good or

568
00:38:16,369 --> 00:38:16,830
not

569
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:19,910
him

570
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:23,470
his people

571
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:29,749
there are some simpler approach this I
could be relied upon

572
00:38:29,749 --> 00:38:32,409
good particularly

573
00:38:32,409 --> 00:38:35,579
where dealing with this simple lanier
workflow

574
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:40,869
huge who

575
00:38:40,869 --> 00:38:44,699
overall mood ship

576
00:38:44,699 --> 00:38:49,159
he is either a simple kosher kind of
protocol

577
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:55,959
who were

578
00:38:55,959 --> 00:39:01,759
hits whenever you're well

579
00:39:01,759 --> 00:39:05,849
aunt every request both the culture

580
00:39:05,849 --> 00:39:09,769
who once step ahead

581
00:39:09,769 --> 00:39:14,619
push me say you'll have

582
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:17,969
NH back guarantee if you try to suck the
work

583
00:39:17,969 --> 00:39:23,349
lol to go several stops the hens a cell
approach will be

584
00:39:23,349 --> 00:39:26,890
to using Cubase protocol we in this case

585
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:31,150
in your web application firewall you'll
generate a set of keys for example ish

586
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:35,309
work local seesaw three operations you
will have three keys generators

587
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:40,479
who if and all this ray case will be

588
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:44,150
he is on the web application firewall in
a particular

589
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:47,709
predetermined order for example

590
00:39:47,709 --> 00:39:52,689
if the user and walks submits a request
that discussed with the other in key

591
00:39:52,689 --> 00:39:59,640
the system will not be able to decipher
it properly or

592
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:05,219
developer cash for it he which means
that his actions will be thwarted

593
00:40:05,219 --> 00:40:08,949
and specialty terminate

594
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:15,200
list

595
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,090
lot in order to protect we're close

596
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:21,360
in order to provide a h-back

597
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,960
talkin protection who

598
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,000
both approaches we get they have to
agree that the

599
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,010
fun to cheer he said he don't store
anything on wall

600
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:38,240
whether ligation file he this

601
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,650
it on who need to install the section
secession

602
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:48,860
control mechanism as he wouldn't saw the
web service for example

603
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:52,150
thank you very much I'll handed over to
Michael

604
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:56,080
he's going to learn more about the
implementation approach he took

605
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,230
help

606
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:03,550
this is a prototype for years in order
to demoss real with me

607
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:06,610
cease he'll we have

608
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:10,440
authentication mandate based access
control

609
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:16,320
producer conceptual here this prototype
can be structured into

610
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:21,870
components we have them middleware here
frameworks inching up then we also have

611
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:25,800
proxies heart proxy purposes we is

612
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:31,320
MySQL proxy utility which is a

613
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:35,430
in most cases he is or load balancing
however

614
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:39,400
scenes he has built Ian interpreter

615
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,590
tokenizer Hulu enter

616
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:50,640
and parser which is great rose because
enable us to identify some of the apt to

617
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,000
say coming mentioned in the request such
as a DNS for example

618
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:01,579
know much but the successful attorney

619
00:42:01,579 --> 00:42:03,000
the role tool

620
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,440
mandate placed polls has for access
control

621
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,460
the and my last polls me

622
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:19,299
supporters old email operators and the
other policies he is a

623
00:42:19,299 --> 00:42:24,609
much already sone

624
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:27,750
analyze a particular requests for
illegal

625
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:33,819
top two got hot top-down processes he
can also distinguish between embed it in

626
00:42:33,819 --> 00:42:34,520
simple

627
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:46,109
Aquarius he can also deal with multiple
and say hi rocking

628
00:42:46,109 --> 00:42:50,119
for example if you have a label for the
DBMS

629
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:53,240
he will also be astonished

630
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,920
role clearest individual columns or rows

631
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:01,770
aunt hitting a table like this he can
easily reach years the Folin all the

632
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:04,470
information you need to configure and
somewhat supped

633
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:07,930
highs all the houses procedure

634
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:13,200
so when the when the first clarity comes
over rice

635
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:18,630
the SKL proxy the config files

636
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:23,609
will be retrieved and checks

637
00:43:23,609 --> 00:43:30,269
for consistency of entities are labels

638
00:43:30,269 --> 00:43:34,069
Qatar thats that type of query is I
don't

639
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:37,249
the curry sent a particular interpreter
which

640
00:43:37,249 --> 00:43:45,740
generates set of labels and on this
labels

641
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:50,210
are a transfer to the entity that is
specially managers access control lists

642
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:50,579
which

643
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:54,839
execution flow can be illustrated as
follows:

644
00:43:54,839 --> 00:43:58,380
so the first thing to be involved his

645
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:03,869
parser and the base on the day you get
there you can

646
00:44:03,869 --> 00:44:07,480
analyze the hierarchy can see whether

647
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:11,200
the coals for example or maintain their

648
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:24,009
cool

649
00:44:24,009 --> 00:44:24,269
no

650
00:44:24,269 --> 00:44:28,059
for example if the user gets access to
the table but doesn't have access to

651
00:44:28,059 --> 00:44:28,659
news

652
00:44:28,659 --> 00:44:32,109
Cole will need analyze the car again

653
00:44:32,109 --> 00:44:37,779
search for call the elite Tatum
identification mechanism

654
00:44:37,779 --> 00:44:41,709
is important because it enables us to

655
00:44:41,709 --> 00:44:44,959
sorry to

656
00:44:44,959 --> 00:44:49,659
all Inc users to a particular request
for a query coming up

657
00:44:49,659 --> 00:44:55,599
but please no

658
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:58,969
in style with a by it taking so

659
00:44:58,969 --> 00:45:03,479
in the cold and snowy that patent user
ID's

660
00:45:03,479 --> 00:45:06,949
and since this ID's can only exist in
the application

661
00:45:06,949 --> 00:45:10,839
well this tool Iran's

662
00:45:10,839 --> 00:45:15,279
is highly application or at the level of
the application are cases Django

663
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:20,539
according to the mondale there are
several ways to generate

664
00:45:20,539 --> 00:45:24,459
he's your own queries are they all have
in common

665
00:45:24,459 --> 00:45:30,640
is had the whole work with the back end

666
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,680
most popular class would be the database
rapper

667
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:38,020
which uses cursors from the

668
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:45,640
database fibers

669
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,150
so curse reserve he usually rocked

670
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:51,690
into cerska rappers and we decided he is
out for

671
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:59,920
this particular experiments CC that

672
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,340
we use the patching and the first query
processing

673
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:08,990
and after that we send all the
indicators and then we

674
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:16,029
take the query

675
00:46:16,029 --> 00:46:18,970
well as rehear the way queria written

676
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:22,730
as we've mentioned to ready the random
number precious

677
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:26,490
replanted to

678
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:33,130
this process because the same killed a
socially is he is

679
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:36,220
inside to be mass because a

680
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:40,980
delivered as usual it's don't
distinguish between users 10

681
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:45,369
after all that there are first-team
honors Killa

682
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:48,470
singer DBMS should do not really have

683
00:46:48,470 --> 00:47:00,220
proposal over security rules if you have

684
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:04,349
any particular access control mistakes
at the level of the application

685
00:47:04,349 --> 00:47:08,049
here will experience her he will have
vulnerabilities as well

686
00:47:08,049 --> 00:47:14,420
some users can access to the user's data
and the system we have destroyed shit

687
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:18,700
protects you against this vulnerability
because a

688
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:22,809
that way you will be able to

689
00:47:22,809 --> 00:47:31,870
at individual conditions in the
following situations:

690
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:34,780
to this is how this conditions can be
generated and

691
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:39,380
muscle Ca 2+ individual situations here
first all will be a relatively simple

692
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:44,300
no classes here we have a column

693
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:47,640
in the protected table in this column

694
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:52,220
we have user's ID

695
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:55,580
well it could be plain text or otherwise

696
00:47:55,580 --> 00:48:02,280
and we need to make sure that we have
some comparison routine

697
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:06,070
built-in and not to play way

698
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:10,930
should be able to teach cool weather
user has access Rice who this particular

699
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:11,440
column

700
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:17,080
I more typical case as this one we had
told her

701
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:22,490
for such a column in The Protector tales
but he can affect

702
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:25,630
a link the role so the table you protect

703
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:29,120
with an isaiah smaller table

704
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:36,730
cool

705
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:40,000
who have a many to many sort of
exemption on here

706
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,110
NEC that we start with a year select
query

707
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:46,780
which retrieves the Maltese over ladies
available

708
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:53,300
to the marginal ID's

709
00:48:53,300 --> 00:49:05,090
are available to the user

710
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:07,970
so this could be done above the level of
the proxy

711
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:11,170
house while last month while the
application and

712
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:23,780
here we have this whole its together
with the early in the application level

713
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:28,950
you

714
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:31,230
all yours need to change your weather

715
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:35,030
cool at the table itself his preference
in the query or not

716
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:48,540
the way it do not is to check its config
data

717
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:54,740
good that's when the to find a location
where we can

718
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:58,480
include this conditions his essentially
days on the structure of the query

719
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,430
how we end this condition how we spend
time together

720
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:07,040
to the DBMS for processing think how
much attention

721
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:14,820
totally someone if you have any
questions please

722
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:28,079
mike is yours bud

723
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:31,819
are the first talk about mandate place
to grow Chandani talk about web

724
00:50:31,819 --> 00:50:32,730
applications

725
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:36,410
which is sorta confusing for me

726
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:39,809
can hear mentioned particular

727
00:50:39,809 --> 00:50:43,010
web application where such

728
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:47,329
mandate based approach actually makes
elsewhere top to bottom information

729
00:50:47,329 --> 00:50:50,119
poster will be my first question has a
question clear sir

730
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:56,359
kit my second question on I know what
first us this question please

731
00:50:56,359 --> 00:51:02,980
do you want me just to name a system or

732
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:08,200
ill you

733
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:12,589
both don't don't know him I have for
example

734
00:51:12,589 --> 00:51:15,750
formal security requirements like that's
you'll

735
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:20,079
believable

736
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:23,299
sleazy his songs

737
00:51:23,299 --> 00:51:26,299
ocean she both sides

738
00:51:26,299 --> 00:51:29,450
like nice purchase pretty strong

739
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:32,480
only see here is that by default

740
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,609
which the usual week of system

741
00:51:35,609 --> 00:51:41,910
you is implemented soon as long as we
come to identify

742
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:46,119
the users probably country really sure
proper protection

743
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:48,890
it

744
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:52,070
I'm sorry my question was different

745
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:59,690
would

746
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:03,360
whose it's a pretty unusual

747
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,540
requirement for TPMS

748
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:10,140
hurts user would built skiing writes all
levels

749
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:15,920
nato and the system

750
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:22,470
on the issue demonstrate doesn't take
into account user higher archaeological

751
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:23,870
links between users

752
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:27,910
Google any old-fashioned

753
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:33,620
D can deploy any policy like always him
is that you have some policy

754
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:37,290
we sold developing a policy

755
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:40,870
scary following a policy would also be
interesting topics

756
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:44,700
anyway not covering here told police he
wished he have some policy

757
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:48,020
also know we illustrate does a variety
is using

758
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:51,800
some very simple case s

759
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:55,410
who'll of us always

760
00:52:55,410 --> 00:53:00,380
hoop

761
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:03,790
no but I'm asking us different

762
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:08,900
why I'm confuse here his thirty is seen
to be

763
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:12,050
bringing together two different concerts
the 10 the

764
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:16,700
told to bottom information flows

765
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:24,550
and the ownership logically call the
ownership laundry is a

766
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:29,480
it was a visionary only support Israel
rewriting SQL queries

767
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:34,640
and I'm not saying it's easy indeed it's
really important to understand the links

768
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,040
to know how to properly configure we've
shown it's possible

769
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:41,450
well

770
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:45,730
wondering whether you can actually 2002
real prices in relational

771
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:50,530
in case he needs help the British nurse
acadia we did it

772
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:54,550
as a piece a research shouldn't now a
short practice

773
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:57,610
I suggest you find a company that we
want to do that

774
00:53:57,610 --> 00:54:01,810
his him

775
00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:04,870
and I think I have an experimental
beyond would be run

776
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:08,550
donate the lakes have your holy index
push we will all have their

777
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:12,530
capability history and other questions
case did

778
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:16,440
have you tried implementing it
practically whatever's

779
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:20,100
here moon

780
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:23,300
now was the applied Delhi research in
other words

781
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:27,840
his

782
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:31,320
well as the network level we can easily

783
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:39,340
he is it with plastic surgery if you're
wondering about possible business

784
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:54,359
applications agenda level known this has
not been done

785
00:54:54,359 --> 00:54:57,579
good

786
00:54:57,579 --> 00:55:01,660
s to find it difficult to wrap my mind
around us

787
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:04,660
cities say

788
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:07,890
there there is this user ID sorry

789
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:12,900
user token and you attach some I
detailed

790
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:15,979
Kojima match this one of token

791
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:19,719
with the

792
00:55:19,719 --> 00:55:26,839
Olmert told him that is maintained in
the database before

793
00:55:26,839 --> 00:55:29,930
initial initialization za

794
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:33,359
speak primary initialization

795
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:37,259
whose parties all went well if he have
anonymous users

796
00:55:37,259 --> 00:55:41,369
income have any access control also
raised

797
00:55:41,369 --> 00:55:46,160
access control only starts working we've
gone through authentication

798
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:55,759
but a cask ale injection

799
00:55:55,759 --> 00:55:59,059
onlookers hell such attacks can be
mounted

800
00:55:59,059 --> 00:56:06,099
a gainst search engines you don't need
to

801
00:56:06,099 --> 00:56:09,390
authentication their rights asians still

802
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:14,989
gets the data from databases polls well
in this case

803
00:56:14,989 --> 00:56:18,140
yes availability of data

804
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:21,170
saw yes kill injection depends own

805
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:25,130
I'll issue structure access control
inside DBMS

806
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:28,729
cool awful

807
00:56:28,729 --> 00:56:33,779
because ask elections simply crowds he
discusses the DBMS rights

808
00:56:33,779 --> 00:56:37,720
used so if you have a proper security
policy running

809
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:42,099
only a DBMS we if it's properly
configured

810
00:56:42,099 --> 00:56:46,739
it could be mandate role play so that
way you will be able to significantly

811
00:56:46,739 --> 00:56:49,769
%uh limits that damage so to speak

812
00:56:49,769 --> 00:56:55,029
his

813
00:56:55,029 --> 00:56:58,229
the water by anonymous users in no
longer have

814
00:56:58,229 --> 00:57:03,650
an anonymous user the web server sounds
like a wary into the DBMS

815
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:06,829
using sounds but see killer account

816
00:57:06,829 --> 00:57:11,089
it's no longer an autonomous old

817
00:57:11,089 --> 00:57:17,930
you who through the viewpoint other DBMS
nobody's anonymous

818
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:22,420
8 tools we're psyched about the same
thing but let's

819
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:27,309
wait to hear what it up thank you very
much ice chests a few have

820
00:57:27,309 --> 00:57:30,339
any other questions for the speaker is
sir please course

821
00:57:30,339 --> 00:57:34,089
speakers outside certainly will be happy
to provide you with additional

822
00:57:34,089 --> 00:57:34,499
information
