1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:04,859
simple yet

2
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:10,730
hi everyone today

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,680
Mb briefly talking about Noster

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:20,290
now positioning to security and have the
4G and 3G networks

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:25,070
used need to keep things are available
online we've been talking about it

6
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:29,130
few times already so cool just briefly
sum it up

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,619
generally there's only two overs here

8
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:38,980
on stage but but 10 people or even more
took part in a research so

9
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:45,020
fortune ok goodnight grab them follow
them in here there's no point in that

10
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,160
but of course to research consists of
tera parts

11
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,110
said related to security

12
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:59,010
the device sex device to 3G and 4G
networks

13
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,980
health provider devices and pine devices
prior devices are

14
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,300
earns GGSN me

15
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,380
an IP network connected to it related to
it

16
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:14,830
and of course radio access the problem
on the axis

17
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,880
that ready access security first client

18
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,400
equipment those are phones madanm says
SIM cards

19
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,259
and so on old still

20
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:35,150
now we've got is it turned out that

21
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:40,110
surprisingly lot of devices to come
devices are available online

22
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,250
to buy a line to purchase line he had a
product credit which

23
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,620
Syria this talk operator internode all
the GGSN

24
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:52,210
a lot of them but if you are looking out
into the engine can be accessed from the

25
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,620
internet

26
00:01:53,620 --> 00:02:01,260
cell can find for example the managing
towards likes us down at

27
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,440
change is fine your and get into the
internal and for the provider can do

28
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,730
well whatever you want

29
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,740
the next thing is the ap level attacks

30
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:15,350
the GDP I called weirdest separate
report and bad last year and the pre

31
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,170
last year

32
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,850
near before that so can find it

33
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,390
the sis summary here's dad

34
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,660
if there's a way to get into the GGSN

35
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,600
a

36
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,650
mention portal the engine at than

37
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,750
s possible to steal confidential
information

38
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,760
in case certain taxes of course you can

39
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,580
for example its yet

40
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,170
organize service failures and you can
only do that in

41
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,680
service provider will be outside GGSN
but also

42
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,730
with any provider in the world because
there's GPRS roaming exchange product

43
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:54,420
call that

44
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,440
allows sending calls to you all the GGS
hands

45
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,010
world

46
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:06,100
so thus the example the attack which God
GDP same Clyde

47
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,190
toward

48
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,520
based on name at the is a basic lowered
then

49
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,360
service failure text when the client
Pakistan's

50
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,970
millions and millions over

51
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,409
calls to open any PG to be context

52
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:25,030
and the first colony to get it 3G or 4G
network

53
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:30,230
from your cell phone and hiciste
hardware is limited in Thrissur such a

54
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,200
few millions are

55
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,909
dozens of millions of calls old all is
filled and the next nine

56
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:39,329
connect their GSN at

57
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:45,370
doesn't get gets the service error and
dozens of millions

58
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,159
when used klein's

59
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:56,170
are without internet about Internet

60
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:00,829
they're also the IP level attacks in
somebody's going to the internet via

61
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:04,609
internet and tries to get to the
internal resources scan Damen

62
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:09,260
he get the access to them for example
and yes sometimes there is the exit at

63
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,299
noon resources

64
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:13,159
an Ambien engine ports to be a

65
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:16,130
the particles like classic HTTP

66
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:21,829
and that leads to the fact that here's a
good example to serves the information

67
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:25,710
it's possible to find out what i did. AP
endpoints

68
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:30,500
private pinpoint that's private network
for example the bank network or

69
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,340
personal telecom network at the
government whatever

70
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,419
you see literally old

71
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:43,070
just put this be and tell the spin at
work in said the falling into the

72
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,280
internal ever get the band

73
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,650
bank the entrance the bank some telecoms
forget about the attacks

74
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,449
the good old DNS styles

75
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:58,650
the LDP tile laying and bloody CPU and
they don't happen when there's a nap

76
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:02,660
money but they forget about the DPN can
easily get internet including roaming by

77
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,009
the way and

78
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:09,370
me get -1 hunters rebels and still be
using Internet

79
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:14,759
me

80
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:20,279
she so telecon should closely watched
their network status for shares

81
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:25,069
the next apart very presentation was the
kid to devise a 3g/4g

82
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:28,770
moslems first at all we've got several
models

83
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,389
and we weren't looking for minor
abilities knows the vices

84
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:36,529
be fine a lot at their homes including
klein's Nexus S

85
00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:39,830
to access our offense so on and so forth
which allow

86
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,360
attacking the client's the and

87
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,569
I in all the models we found on our
abilities like

88
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:49,260
remote code execution

89
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:54,990
and and since there's no protection from
see us her apt been almost an device

90
00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:00,580
and is executed remotely any cold on the
modern display be ascending there are

91
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,620
link to the image it's possible to
effectively vice

92
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,420
get the DNS puffing to swap

93
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,480
their DNS a survey title

94
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,820
and steel trap a powders awaits you

95
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,230
miss you up this mess enter and steal
messages

96
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:23,750
and the other interesting thing to do in
either the moms we found

97
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,250
he yes the speedy

98
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,110
spirit to execute the random cardin

99
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:35,560
was possible to declared cell iDEN

100
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,910
easily Deanna my eyes the position of
their client

101
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:42,940
exam here I'm going from home to work
and

102
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,850
I have my name in my pocket pocket
router my pockets on a boat

103
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:51,070
and every five minutes be a DNS it sends
my position

104
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:59,170
and i transfer but the open so I D did
she or

105
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,310
location I get the image you

106
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:06,660
is a test sample we up speed

107
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,360
said the script you there's free love
portal the script at

108
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,420
detects be HTTP protocol the vulnerable
versions at the bottom

109
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,409
and collected over 5,000

110
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:21,169
but that gonna burst the bottom in one
week

111
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:25,749
that means that if we in addition to
texan

112
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:28,869
love infection you but this thing will
find

113
00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:33,939
5,000 decade modems per week would

114
00:07:33,939 --> 00:08:09,750
please switch on the video

115
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:23,000
up

116
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,210
appears the old media I'll

117
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:29,870
in DS the self-service portal land lease
and

118
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,180
and Nexus S once more be a SMS

119
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,769
and automatically it's being rendered
inept personal

120
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:40,120
add personal account to the page at the
moment

121
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,810
the which all the settings go through an

122
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:46,529
and their automatic setting this list
just all leaders to press the f5 to get

123
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:47,650
into the main window

124
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:52,220
so XSS be in excess we said and

125
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,320
the demand for well

126
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,730
justice and the password to the
self-service portal and that password

127
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,940
gets back

128
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,360
to the same web interface cell that was
steel

129
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,560
and password and

130
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,620
delete EA messaging into the subsurface
portal and do whatever we want their get

131
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,730
the confidential information about the
user

132
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:21,540
about the counts everything netted

133
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:26,660
good

134
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:30,699
use world

135
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:34,750
source on the message get the message we
integrate into that

136
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,800
code and a peach it's easy to

137
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,279
delete all these high toll as we just
kept for the video

138
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,120
and and a it will all get into the
interface

139
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,889
market will tell us

140
00:09:49,889 --> 00:10:03,010
more detail about some hardcore stuff

141
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,740
his

142
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,120
show here have the

143
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,500
control USB device he

144
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,770
camby years we give me a bad years be

145
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:18,640
he an RESP device works

146
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,520
on Linux you

147
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,760
the drivers can be found

148
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:30,350
dont be in a source 3 from colonel organ
for example at the drive issues began

149
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,970
aged

150
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:36,180
also you can find their incompetent
framework which would allow yet to

151
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,770
employer mandates the drivers with
different functions which would combine

152
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,580
functionality scratch

153
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:46,430
yes sending can be the keyboard in the
bottom at the same time

154
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:52,240
any way you like it so yep

155
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,730
whose and take the entire trappers

156
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,890
there's a compass a driver call and
write see

157
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:02,300
which contains the common land you I

158
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:07,220
which allows BSES affairs switch on a
switch up the device change the function

159
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,230
and the guys

160
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:13,220
and on and on for example your favorite
cell phone can be transformed

161
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,480
and sure where from to record a voice
recorder

162
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,850
for example bad when the most
interesting is there

163
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:23,290
keyboard device so

164
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:27,320
he put away the Android Market here
there's the apt pupil ok

165
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,540
more directly into it will see that we
need to patch the quarry compile it

166
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,089
share

167
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:35,230
in up in the new one but it's a bit
boring and did not

168
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:40,720
doesn't fit our objective sold can we
turns a firm

169
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,540
the router into the keyboard me

170
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,069
take a gander driver discovered the
driver there's a

171
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:52,209
massive this point function which
included

172
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:55,559
again with the key word in there so in
theory this possible

173
00:11:55,559 --> 00:12:01,879
weekend had show that in runtime getting
through the kernel symbol

174
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:04,910
and find as good as some other support
functions

175
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:10,120
symbol restart the device in get a lot
of Puppets

176
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,790
when we started reading the drivers

177
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:17,839
turnout at Lenox now is the best thing
all

178
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,519
on the Fylde ahead to you guys it's not
support its so

179
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:28,240
we had to drag a 10 carefully into the
infrastructure was present there so

180
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,970
also we get a all those ever magic
issues

181
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,170
which are depended on the Marshall

182
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,499
it which is to a written for a
particular

183
00:12:39,499 --> 00:12:42,689
core also you

184
00:12:42,689 --> 00:12:46,269
can can get different CPU Z can be an
arm and not arm

185
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:48,960
anything else something different

186
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,940
are so the window guys

187
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,970
airliners doing the

188
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:57,770
killed

189
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,770
when those guys have a hobby to rewrite
the quarry patch the Corso now

190
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:11,839
the stem is a good kid

191
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:12,779
world

192
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:16,910
here's a sample of love how usually know
we take the ordinary

193
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:23,440
browder good and we plug it into an
ordinary computer and will be

194
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,519
identified as the mod M the

195
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:37,670
will see this analyst devices

196
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,920
good

197
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,280
UN have device here yet

198
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:51,310
and tsunami this is the ordinary high
link you I

199
00:13:51,310 --> 00:14:00,379
so soon Rd vice will turn

200
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:08,959
into the keyboard said

201
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,100
and somehow our keyboard starts printing
on its own

202
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:20,790
up

203
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,410
did when

204
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:26,829
growing there for the bias information
just in case

205
00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:34,899
and rebooting up

206
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:39,430
Center keyboard is not only keyboard
also fresh tried

207
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:44,649
so when it loads who can click a

208
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:47,910
put into load mode and stole the book it
easley

209
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:54,790
thank you that that's not ed

210
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:58,019
gets go back we have two minutes more up

211
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:01,339
two more minutes his so since Week

212
00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:05,410
cookin something on on Windows is of
course a bit boring insipid

213
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:09,629
thats dismiss reports pretty quick it's
invisible but course some butts may be

214
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:11,720
missed so that's why we'll do it

215
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,550
its slightly different think anything
can list but on the next video

216
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,920
up at a swap

217
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:24,600
so here you

218
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,720
weekend identified the USB

219
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,160
on our ability this one day it's
implemented faced answer

220
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:36,029
and we can do this more habit sure thing

221
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:48,829
that's why I will be more simple he
nothing dead

222
00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:52,120
would like to show is my favorite my
champion

223
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,829
says e theory 3 72 the monomer the
platform

224
00:15:56,829 --> 00:16:01,310
slick and permits armless box stack
overflow

225
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:06,490
though the remote clothing from the
thing where in a hireling cafe where

226
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:12,040
bed just once upon a time I was looking
for that mask and

227
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:17,029
I saw this horrible lines in a good
night nationwide this

228
00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:21,220
this is about why links would right way
that it loads different operating system

229
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,370
in turn out that would be

230
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:25,930
actually have noticed the elephant in
the room that was that

231
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:29,420
to core ships at one

232
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:34,589
unimaginable index which is responsible
for years P routing and so forth

233
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:38,770
and another mention by the exports which
issue occurs corresponding with them

234
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:43,140
absurd the rebar so this this is the
baseband processor everybody who

235
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:43,860
reversed their

236
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,700
base member censor it knows this is the
the hell

237
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,060
the Senate as hell visually the

238
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:55,660
and there are other functions other 3gpp
that she would have to read Libertas

239
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,170
which are quite weird

240
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:00,270
so you know of course you would have to
debug it

241
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,430
YX works is good it

242
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:07,030
it loads lennox and Linux the often me

243
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:12,560
tells you the address load address so
just loaded

244
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,579
and by the way he had seashell is the
keypad shared

245
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:19,699
can be thrown through for different
objectives such as research

246
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:22,829
or other bad stuff

247
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:29,000
all nasty stuff seashell hours 2d but
the baseband processor in real time

248
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,390
and way allows to you

249
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:37,020
find information about the network good

250
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,250
he it supports it 2g and 3G

251
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,500
as can the fun thing to stardom for

252
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,700
but that's become poor for the poor are
reversing

253
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,070
is also beautiful because condensed
their titles appall the

254
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,120
objects almost all objects including
global arrivals

255
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,260
so we actually at the C Cody

256
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:02,290
& Poor's the there's the as X in it easy
in its well-documented

257
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,370
he so his own

258
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:09,180
the attics her face is spread known to
them service machine

259
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:13,660
get the gentleman but also on the radio
part he

260
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:17,460
take an address the operator on on other
clients which are there to

261
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,200
was

262
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,909
thank you questions ship

263
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:33,710
the mic

264
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,410
yep

265
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:41,040
up

266
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,300
up

267
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:50,800
question is know their this can wait by
roger was very popular

268
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:55,220
boorda before she routers with the Ford
we would work in the bug in the bottom

269
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,100
so it can a

270
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,620
and into gives it as a router two main
devices so

271
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:04,590
would a are talking about we're talking
about Texas writers

272
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,550
wifi routers ok the first part 2 BR

273
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:11,890
Thursday she and the scanner miles were
where we did file

274
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:17,580
find the XSS but its to Hattiesburg
guess the SMS and be at the Xmas

275
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:22,679
estimates bus would exploit the excess
peak still

276
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:25,740
Dixon this is not being read you well

277
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,850
if the client does not render the SMS
service and the web browser

278
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:33,770
of course there's no way to exploit it
the device this may but if there's some

279
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,720
kind of injuries there's always some
kind

280
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,660
interface for the SMS that it's possible

281
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:44,590
the

282
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:48,890
a there are also some exotic here SQL
injections which are hard to explode

283
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,600
however they are available because

284
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,660
the estimates are being capped elements
stored in the SQL database

285
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:58,790
up this it thank you
