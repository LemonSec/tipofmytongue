1
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,299
two measures to boost in a Maya

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,840
present that sir yeah

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,530
pagodas so I mean or disrupt the filing
fee so embarrassed the

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,949
numbers the in the post at the Kwame

5
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:20,650
but dawn my book open a soft W Mercer

6
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,869
and

7
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:29,599
genders decision on suspicion so

8
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,840
as you met or know when you want to
unlock to assist them

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,940
you have to enter your password dentist
by somebody's

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,320
ash with a one-way hash function sees
result

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,190
is compelled to fight for example you
just shy to indicate is a Phoenix

12
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:47,750
if the two-volume I she's much then you
have access to a system

13
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,320
was a was your rejected bus truck
parking is just

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,500
after pitching the bus value only from
ash

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,090
so account just ives arch file as a as a
fight which

16
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,309
in touch and want to get the bus for
back from remains simple approach was

17
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:05,790
that these

18
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,790
with for us so for us to get defied then
for all each

19
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,260
possible bus would value your computer
showed his value

20
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,409
and you find a much define his approach

21
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,799
bites you you can you to rate was a bus
values so you can

22
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,960
just you just need competition that
power don't need any memory

23
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,220
and

24
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,970
jim was basic up for fall

25
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,680
as for cracking another common
approaches

26
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,750
precomputed dictionary attack it's a
simple you create the database

27
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:39,160
oneself bus under responding touch just
passed

28
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,830
and then for a given but ash just have
to chip

29
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:46,820
his ever and see the bus was inside
guess you just

30
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:51,710
the bus by so it can be seen as a
positive the bridge was up for

31
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:55,310
because in these days as soon as you
approach it is that the vase you only

32
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,250
need one that have his new job to get
stuff to bust but we need a lot of

33
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,950
memory to store the database

34
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:05,990
but you don't need any competition
apollo center is a trade-off between

35
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,869
brute force

36
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:10,679
on for complete addition around like its
current whatever

37
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,400
a Dutch so I wouldn't go into details
for this attack but

38
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,580
the main ages use does the first and the
last for another

39
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,350
assist a look and then we've ash and
rejection function competition

40
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,459
try to pass for so you can really

41
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:28,940
a you can we do a trade off between
competition

42
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:34,360
on memory storage its Richard up between
the two previous %uh so

43
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,590
one common and when and consumers juries
for searching

44
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,350
sages just to usher sold concatenated
live up us for

45
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:45,220
he stood up only assertions apostle and
zenza

46
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,459
so it is a pubic bone you I need store
are into

47
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,920
in the actual 255 so then if you

48
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,790
are generate random Neil sold it makes

49
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,730
injection around when the Tiber much
more difficult

50
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:02,549
but it doesn't change anything to bridge
was because again you just to read it

51
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:03,980
was a bus for value

52
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,469
knows assault because its beauty so as
you may know

53
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:11,060
sorties now implemented in most modem up

54
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,260
system for example index use a randomly
generated sold

55
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,829
we've five toes and torsion up shuffle
112

56
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:21,939
as a national action to bus for trucking

57
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:25,469
is where is a program which had has been
wasted ways to die

58
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:29,060
Sarkozy's the serology my store

59
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,659
like John sorry bro ash dumps saris a
bus with Russian competition

60
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:36,970
apenas those days to select new a

61
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,109
tourism we've mortars delivered property

62
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:43,310
and or so you may be with you've maybe
scienza

63
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,340
ash from the Panthers for during
Tuesday's last week

64
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:52,269
which was also passersby can contest
know something to be different

65
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:55,840
the trip the first such a diverse is a
fine portraits of them

66
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,519
it included in to YouTube scone and and
its use by default for on for adoption

67
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,030
in movement meaning that when you in
style

68
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,959
your system you should check exists
unclear might win for the checkbooks

69
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,090
you it was a trip to face to encrypt
your home for the a

70
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:18,479
to to do that passphrase is randomly
generated

71
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,409
and as fast as will be used for final
tradition and decryption

72
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:26,370
we've he is by default just buzz phrase
miss me

73
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,360
unproved and store Ind and the hardest

74
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,409
it it is done is a brought by specified
and in the crib that has the process

75
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:39,520
of bust as a precaution is called G
rubbing so too

76
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,340
rupkey it's quite simple you went with
the sort on the bus hold

77
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,759
you I should 65 doesn't five so 26 time

78
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:51,960
we shuffle but when the 16 frostbite to
the resort with deserve refugee

79
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,380
then you rush as a intermediate risk

80
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:59,380
once when what time and you obtain a
signature just signature will be store

81
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,710
in the robustness fight at the beginning
of the fight then use

82
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:07,420
surgeon in which is right pinkie to
improve the bus phrase we've a yes

83
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,310
and you storms over a vice president the
same fight so

84
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,060
if you you you read your you're up by
specified

85
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,670
you would see at the beginning the
signature and green and interrupt us

86
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,150
phrase

87
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:24,940
in right 206 yards and use it for fun
detentions bites you know

88
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,900
UN besote on the password you rush up

89
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,280
65536 time you'd put the refugee

90
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,700
you rushing to me just one more time and
you

91
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:41,250
obtain this a smidge xenical business
manager is a signature store in to fight

92
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,090
is a is a much you know that children
Richards akroyd ready

93
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:50,200
so as I show you before he could def
issues assault

94
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,410
which is a good thing however as he sold

95
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:57,180
is by default always a SEM if it is not
up

96
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,300
if a under the value is not return in
the complete file

97
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,980
in zone for them and is that you uses
for that you will be as usual 1122

98
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:09,070
extra and you to do the same for or the
installation of

99
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:13,500
a trip to face and if you want to use
the crib the first was a

100
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,860
willem for adoption you must use a
different sort value

101
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,070
because you cannot restore project file
in your room for doubt because it would

102
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,760
be uplifted

103
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,280
and in addition in Ubuntu

104
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,940
as a rubbing bus for the zurich is a use
a busload for simplicity

105
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,410
so that's the user just looking losses
by soldiers for again

106
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,840
and then you choose from find the
friction meanings that

107
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,120
with a deferred still be if you're a to
turn around when but to protect

108
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,620
are placebo

109
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,539
again to use a password directly from
purchasing each

110
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:47,130
so that's what we did and joining us

111
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,210
our research we know it is that you
could the first major fucking was

112
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,800
already been implemented

113
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,960
arena is a jumble russians so you just
have to a teller agenda it was a teacher

114
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,370
the first nature then you up to defaults
on value

115
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:05,780
and zenza as a she signature my Morsi
bozos even the

116
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,819
fighters believed which helps you to
extract is just the nature from the

117
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:11,770
robustness pilot Jurich it was a chance
or performance

118
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:15,789
so it was quite easy would run just
software

119
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:18,830
under famous right to file a witch hunt
and Fort Union

120
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:23,479
common password weaves a difference in
value so it took just one months

121
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:26,659
understand a computer but we made his
dictionary available

122
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:30,120
on your YouTube so now we can use for
our a

123
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,520
to reverse a Russian Standard just I
need to get this

124
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,909
this dictionary so

125
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:41,150
Azera Giffords the program has a real be

126
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:45,219
a been an additional in approved is back
which has opened last show

127
00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:48,409
and that's so but from our finding a but

128
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:52,740
burnt to a new issue has been open and
it has been quickly a corrected by the

129
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,909
crib diff is different from

130
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:59,080
a sorry budget is that they created a
new file version

131
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,259
which that weaves last three years or
two and in the new version

132
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:07,120
the switches randomly generated we've
from the random

133
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,419
source and the saudis by default store

134
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:14,919
interrupt bus first bite and as soon as
you have a digital system

135
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:18,209
if you looked up and looking again San
to fight will be

136
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:22,330
to much critical budget because abrupt
ASM bus president ran

137
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:26,419
justified from it which we change so
with the friction

138
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:30,289
the I she speeds is less such means a
signature is a

139
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:35,130
less attractive for bus for the Treacy
because you need to print 65 those in

140
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,419
a torsion up shop but 12 competitors a

141
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:41,969
five toes and iteration trawlers stand
on the next million system

142
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:46,120
but by the way we update surgeon to
undercut by constrict

143
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:51,430
to for Patricia practice new fight from
it so

144
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,899
to check that your system has been
updated you again a benzo

145
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:58,019
robustness fight and you can see that
it's tough

146
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:02,029
sweet Israel to then you as a randomly
generated sort

147
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:06,730
and then again to signature underpass
free so

148
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:11,040
to summer a which seems that as soon as
a bus ride is used for something else

149
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,509
that

150
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:15,259
login evens a ash russians a pass-first
it increases

151
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:19,509
attacks her face so we need to be really
careful when we we we use such future

152
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:24,149
and future we would be interested to see
