1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,840
simplicity

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,769
hi everyone

3
00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:15,389
today will tell you about Kyle

4
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:18,529
accidentally we got our own shot and

5
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:21,770
we being Markham

6
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,240
by Lil mmm I'll me and my colleagues
eager

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,490
from time to time we present a different
comprende says we have a blog love we

8
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:30,859
love

9
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:38,260
pkts PHDs be right about us

10
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:43,370
we work in their ionisation it's called
acculturated controlling the Internet

11
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,000
technologies Department

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,010
and mostly we do they develop the
separate development to solutions that

13
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,050
work

14
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,160
in the areas up a IT security

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,710
and use different skill level cloud
technologies

16
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:03,940
hood

17
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,380
whatever task it to control the premier
the holding network

18
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,350
the outside perimeter the

19
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,509
deep do enterprise were calling are
situated around russian with the aspect

20
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:17,509
to the security

21
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:20,649
s2 periodically look through our own
network

22
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:23,729
and accumulate information about them

23
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:34,140
would

24
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,450
cool so

25
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:40,790
next year too we found that the this is
a feasible approach me published

26
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,410
their hairs plead

27
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:48,310
vulnerability and immediately almost
immediately

28
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:53,050
soon as we can so that in the advisory
find out

29
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:58,360
which persians I are looking into the
intent and what socially vulnerable fix

30
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,600
that quickly

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,590
so there was a.m. a feasible a regional
approach

32
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:13,030
also

33
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,090
since the practical security israel

34
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:22,910
up are other task where essentially
interested in collecting the data and

35
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,819
the devices

36
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:27,550
to connect to the internet but the
device someone from our organizations

37
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:33,760
on organizations but also a city peace
cad last year

38
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,860
we took part in there PHDs

39
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,870
I contest seldom

40
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,000
how does that work from the side

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,830
we store the data on this

42
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,140
the this scanning that network scanning
and its

43
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,510
they've been stored in a cluster service
it's all organized for the

44
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,350
most horizontal a skill ability and the
user can get to the website

45
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:09,990
as the ordinary Shotton it's done

46
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:15,880
who'll said

47
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,940
you sana

48
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,790
all the ports were problematic there
there were some problems with flexible

49
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:23,430
search

50
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,980
the clients of course love scene the
statistics

51
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,970
so here's their

52
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:37,360
would here's to being sampled the fresh
from their bodies the SSS

53
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,819
nixon service 4.5 and lowered

54
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:44,250
we its you actually could see you

55
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:49,980
a bad is the situation if we ask the
shot in who'll

56
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,940
he stressed the show and show us the
version

57
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,310
diversions it will show

58
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,750
everything that it's able to find bob
both 4.5

59
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,920
but we need lower than 45 as well

60
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,420
shuttle show the 47 and everything
altogether

61
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:21,950
so up

62
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,540
we were able to get the statistics

63
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,890
would on the vulnerable supper

64
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:35,040
thanks to our solutions up to the
russian 4.5 good

65
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,220
with the regular expression we used
regular expression for that

66
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:51,340
so this

67
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,170
by steep UE H it's quite informative

68
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:59,410
asserted oh so TP is quite interesting
thing

69
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,120
but they're quite complicated for an
ordinary views are so

70
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,010
if you were particularly interested in
this subject and discuss in more detail

71
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:12,430
will up to continue the issue

72
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,360
%uh right we had missing in the Chardon

73
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,000
we love getting to the harbors see
what's interesting in their

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,830
and from time to time we find mm cash
stuff

75
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,270
for those are the who doesn't know

76
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:31,230
should so example there is the open
chord

77
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,520
hang out se llevan

78
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,600
11 to

79
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,840
11 but the session there

80
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:48,760
good so it seemed almost the same thing
is hardly can read online read more

81
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,300
about it

82
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:54,840
self there's just an airport there and
we wanna see how many buses like this

83
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,500
they're out with the open port and
they're connected to the Internet

84
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,240
to get the surgery sudden there's
certain ported

85
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,800
in some cash did and see it shows the

86
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,080
considerable number of record so it's
its it's wonderful

87
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,690
great I good

88
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:20,510
me another example only I am searching
for an arm and trying to find the OPP

89
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:24,630
would lead to banks and because um
specialist in banks but just

90
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:28,060
as an example to show a

91
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,450
simply that from 10 to 18 some extra
expulsions

92
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,860
shouldn't doesn't want to be by

93
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,800
does not find these kinda things and
based solutions church

94
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,630
good some times we had together and
static sent

95
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:48,000
once twice a day but sit for hours and
hours and from time tension stops

96
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,260
understanding you

97
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:55,870
it finished good sense ups understanding
certain queries which it was a listing

98
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,580
yes gene so it's hard to get this this
is when there's a developer

99
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,550
pressure developers the way is harder
definitely

100
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,650
celled basin a similar reports

101
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:11,210
similar queries we can find things like
this

102
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,230
a here one my some might say that we

103
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:17,560
but hes gonna bang since our zone here
the R

104
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,930
but let's close see what we found in the
end

105
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:25,710
you but we can actually be most as
hacking banks and

106
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,800
bed sure that the banks are vulnerable
so here's the

107
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,220
the first bank that the Swiss private
bank although

108
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,980
are the cells are the stem cells are
some

109
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,580
we can see whose stem cells are on Wed

110
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:44,120
that website probably the snack wide
quite what we were looking for

111
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,120
the chipmunk wide by

112
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,240
his sis the operator other WiFi operator

113
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,120
why am I saying this there this issues
with search

114
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,630
one till it's never enough together

115
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,830
and chemical act on the information to
execute the task

116
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,860
there's in this has to understand how
the Tool Works

117
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,169
to made

118
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:11,419
yet

119
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:16,120
one while we did find some lot

120
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,289
re finery of financial institutions okay
we go after them

121
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:24,289
we see that's the sum of I'm cache
statistics

122
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:28,889
and now it can go to conference s and
the claim that the bank is all normal

123
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:34,000
but it is found that the port is open
volum Realty is there but it cannot be

124
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,520
exploited

125
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,950
because hash is empty

126
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:43,060
did and it's not five-minute

127
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:47,540
snapshot sowwy a mmm

128
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,970
check this side periodical a and to see
whether

129
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:55,150
the science has any date it all and we
found that

130
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:58,959
no data can be found maybe they

131
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,960
did a good job

132
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,880
but if we look into it steeper

133
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,600
we find that he s mother there is a bug
but to

134
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,730
it's over now use tone toward is

135
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,410
be showdown and the a similar thing that
we did

136
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:22,610
that I would like to make this point two
we did not want to compete with a

137
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,370
shotgun

138
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,590
but to at some point it will it became
impossible to use show done so we had to

139
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,830
reinvent the whole thing in New York and

140
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:35,600
as we need to work with statistics went
honest and where to get it

141
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,740
shot on as its own wat database

142
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:44,380
it it collects data from my internet
scanning and a

143
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,430
information is a given to the user on

144
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:52,360
request tell where candidate to be taken
from paralysis

145
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,950
Micah open source s public will

146
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:59,450
sources and the economic

147
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:03,590
export all that into your own database
and then goal look into that

148
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:07,670
this is what we did in the beginning
enid

149
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,510
you

150
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:14,020
but the problem is at such data along
the

151
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,850
said update up-to-date and not all ports

152
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:22,890
are accessible lead

153
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:27,170
and as my colleague reminds me and cash

154
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:31,090
42 was and not there at all good

155
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:35,560
when the until look at that site so we
started our own scanning

156
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,240
in this is where they had trouble begins

157
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,660
with that

158
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,759
information from hearse pleated

159
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:51,569
information the Daytona is as late as
April

160
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:54,720
but the providers start its

161
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,699
your to blocker HTTPS multiple HTTPS sir

162
00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:02,879
inquire as met in care what trafficker

163
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,009
multiple inquiry it

164
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:10,040
to cause the band miss immediately cut
us short and bill

165
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,740
dishonest do accumulator also this text

166
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,420
toi used and map

167
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:23,180
anti map to build our own database

168
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:27,160
a at in terms of analysis would need to
have some problems

169
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,500
and %um of court for example you want to

170
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,939
to see to see how many their orders
there are

171
00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:37,839
in within the Cisco Systems you find and
William but then the EU

172
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,850
gold dig deeper and you say is see that
there are

173
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:44,439
the not all those devices are the
routers

174
00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:47,490
another results the was

175
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:51,800
another outcome was so that sweep on
Cisco but there's also a Synology and

176
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,639
Windows him I am using the

177
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:59,110
up and share porch too is it Cisco not
siskel

178
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:04,310
so if we try to look into that's really

179
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:07,620
%um marauders

180
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,640
can access ports and live in the
situation that

181
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,830
to the Cisco forwards the other two
devices

182
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:18,680
to the particular port another
statistical problem how many Synology

183
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,640
devices there on the internet

184
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:25,260
we ended and made an enquiry the result
is nine thousand we go to the ports in

185
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,279
on Synology

186
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:30,089
there are many of them not on the MRN
Shaun am then we

187
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:34,390
you see map and what is modest
interesting here is

188
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:38,560
to there's L who line in the HTTP title

189
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,610
we didn't to all the search engine and
then we find eleven thousand devices

190
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:48,750
and these are quite valuable entries not
trash

191
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:54,570
the much better than i and using
Synology as keyword

192
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:58,070
once again as is shown here we have a
problems

193
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:04,250
when attempting to use Chardon to them

194
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,800
number one we use ALTER alternative by

195
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,160
requests maybe it's any in bill shot on
problem

196
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,320
so the as you analyze statistical
problems

197
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,530
the key maybe the way how devices
connected

198
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:24,500
directors winter and all through a
firewall and the firewall may be within

199
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,690
the device itself

200
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,710
another elsa

201
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:32,010
else problem we use again we a local for

202
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:36,900
I was search for a heart beated one
earned 14

203
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,970
thousand entries not too many but if we
ask

204
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,100
about scripts good I

205
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,350
showing your own abilities and find 3.5
thousand

206
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:54,550
entries it

207
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:58,550
one of the problems was updating the
entries we found one million entries

208
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,399
here

209
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,509
%uh on Cisco wonderful how many

210
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:07,220
are now was it two weeks a goal

211
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:13,939
maybe this one Antrim and he is no
longer exists is correlated

212
00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:18,980
so we update in this cell where
arrangements a.m. to use a search

213
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:23,240
a robot's images to show off how many
ways sir

214
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,379
founder then we push that button which
says

215
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:29,589
updated and the the search

216
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:35,279
robot processes all the answers and the
shows which of them are

217
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,930
up-to-date and finally upon us how

218
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:42,930
how'd you know where whereby

219
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,830
the occasion

220
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:48,100
manhood

221
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,380
may GM is located and you

222
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:57,160
in the ATM says it is South there were
times when the hiker had to

223
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,560
physical approach in nineteen machine to
a empty

224
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,070
the cartridge of the mountain banknotes

225
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,200
of course they entered is not to allow
your

226
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,780
and to do that but to we do not know
everything has a lead

227
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:14,280
existed for two years and

228
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,240
everyone and that nobody was troubled
until this problem was discovered

229
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,700
so we need to be can't really careful
especially in with the addresses

230
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,110
okay now we're ready to take questions

231
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:31,400
should

232
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,060
no we didn't all fun the yet that yet

233
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,660
if you are interested we can a should
demonstrate how it works outside this

234
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,320
session

235
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:47,600
know when they're not see is plans as
serious as that

236
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,720
nice one question on the back

237
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,250
said

238
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,390
you think you would see rattling
interesting and very topical

239
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:03,570
some questions a which kinda computation
devices said do you support your

240
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:09,510
I search a robot second question how do
you address the problems of Henny Ponce

241
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:15,420
screening yet thus far as I know all the
nose in the network which can be

242
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,250
vulnerable

243
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,360
for on how to bleed ninety-nine percent
of them are honey honey because

244
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,910
was funny because I can say

245
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:27,470
Mon used

246
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,640
mostly

247
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,529
we r after statistics

248
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:36,400
ok honey poss gives you a false positive

249
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:41,150
not a hundred not always

250
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,880
and her sweetie

251
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,200
it is easy to check if it's gives you a
sensible

252
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,490
sensitive information it's not a
honeypot used

253
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:57,430
but Naxal networks looking for honey
poss

254
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,779
we r really after

255
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:06,959
internal networks after statistics as
for the social but

256
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:12,730
and different parts there's a Bay
database sparks where data stores and

257
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:13,500
the robot

258
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,420
it's like a machine it and you can

259
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:21,740
the start imagining you can have as many
of them as you want

260
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,439
did you try to compare this with a mass
scam

261
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:31,020
yes we know this says a utility we use
them

262
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,240
and searching for solutions yes
