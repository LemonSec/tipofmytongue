you that I will do ulitzer passes the
sport you gotta love morton's should

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,180
%uh after which is used in berlin you
only has

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:17,420
systems of our control technology
processes simply speak about it today

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,650
the topic a it

5
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:25,500
composition and my presentation may look
very basic one but let's bring to your

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,050
attention

7
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,830
very principal difference drawn

8
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,129
common

9
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:37,420
systems of in for protection in the
office network from

10
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:42,320
those which re: used and have to be
applied to two def and

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,110
apcs is automated process control
systems

12
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:52,870
ABC es well let's try to achieve

13
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,610
Riley what is going to you for an answer
at

14
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,149
between ABC es ser protection systems
from

15
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,189
of his defense is the first IPL festival
the priorities are

16
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,829
different in the apcs systems dimitri I
T

17
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:11,310
he's too is the

18
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,299
reliability of functioning continue the
city also are functioning

19
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:21,420
and while in corporate systems the
looting

20
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,189
is confidentiality Andalucia versus code
in the shower see it and then

21
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:30,020
the automated systems of control process
control

22
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,740
ABC es de el polar bears have their
functioning

23
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,510
the threat to the improper functioning
could be

24
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:43,480
the a threat to life to environment and
two significant

25
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:48,090
all our threat to the business I'll
because the emotional processes and

26
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,260
their folly you

27
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,740
well the Manitoba process sometimes is
very

28
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,760
hi expensive wild for the corporate

29
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,120
networks first two-goal these
technologies

30
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,270
in vast majority and they do not

31
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,430
threat lives well sometimes at the

32
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,850
early yes sir of his life's there were

33
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:19,410
research is drawn that they were a
champs mater with the help of

34
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,910
influence against the human psychology

35
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,390
they could somehow

36
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:32,470
damage at the health and life people but
this is not specific to the office

37
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,810
network protection so demeanor problem

38
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:39,790
is the integrity of data in Los a pony
her

39
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,040
the EPS

40
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,080
a BCS system who

41
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,680
has a very high requirements high
requirement

42
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,750
to took a stability predictability of
the system because the system

43
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:01,019
in main positive it is a real tyson it's
not always like that it's not

44
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:05,120
everywhere it's a real time system not
all ABC SEC was a real

45
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,150
licenses but nevertheless many of them

46
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,550
are and it's a very important week 1

47
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,030
in the office networks transactions

48
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:20,360
who delivered the software 40 the
industrial networks

49
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,680
also are different it be General
Electric Siemens

50
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,200
he could gather Honeywell another
companies including Microsoft

51
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,440
and for the office networks main

52
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,630
clears are also the big ones also a big

53
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,380
offenders but they are different vendor

AP you will

62
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,170
approach and look at these differences
from the point of view

63
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,860
main principles made targets that are
being

64
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,710
achieved by means of e for security

65
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:32,210
if for the war peretz companies that
three main objective

66
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,390
confidentiality of data integrity of
data

67
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:39,320
and availability of data for corporate
network

68
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,800
these objects ESL Ecco city jealousies

69
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,090
highs a but integrity and availability
they also

70
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,320
are important but less a priority while
for industrial networks

71
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,490
I'll ability and integrity of data

72
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:57,540
has the highest priority and
confidentiality very often plays an

73
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,680
important role

74
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,110
bought the priority as a rule

75
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:07,000
a is lower in other words even office
networks we speak

76
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,620
barred information security which means
company shows him data

77
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,660
the in technological networks

78
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:22,060
it's taken to the city on the process

79
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,740
you know this conference is mostly TK
did tools

80
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,240
availability and discovery of different
threats and

81
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,000
a come to fighting them look many people
speak about it but in my presentation

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,280
I don't want to share a big piece of our
children section but nevertheless we

83
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,300
like to say that

84
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,340
a admitted process control systems a
very

85
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,400
often are subject to attacked this is
not very

86
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,600
often addition formation is published in
mass media

87
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,340
and becomes known to white public main
reason you can understand

88
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,740
because

89
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,780
the year victims and

90
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,560
victim organizations they don't want to
disclose this information to public

91
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,570
and Julie speaking its right thing to do

92
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:13,240
Butler less lost year we have fixed

93
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,570
several cases when a

94
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:21,150
automated process control systems sir
were Darci man tent

95
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,090
they have documented informational
influence against

96
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:29,170
such a committee proscar so tosses in
January 2014

97
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,200
we have faced the keys documented case

98
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,650
where the through a certain

99
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,810
in fact enter the software upgrades

100
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,160
malicious caught

101
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,000
have penetrated into the control center
all far

102
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,240
Mon Jun 20 nuclear power plant and for
certain

103
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,670
bit of time it has existed that before
administration have cleaned it

104
00:06:53,670 --> 00:07:02,470
which has required said efforts and time

105
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:06,020
in this summer 2014 dowd was

106
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,650
another well-known attack and it is to
collect

107
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:13,340
energy and like energy click image to
click injury energy 3

108
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,960
it was developing well one all for

109
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,849
components all these a virus complete
like energized

110
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:24,590
Hynix twin how the exit was a
distributed

111
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,590
through the servers

112
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:31,479
for PC servers and according to the
weakness of the respected organization

113
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:35,599
ACS surged is still use Asian which

114
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,490
shows information about

incidents and threats in the national
networks its americanization course

116
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:46,690

117
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:50,840
the straw n malicious 31

118
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,810

heiress

119
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,950
it has damaged it has damaged some

120
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:00,070
all PCs servers which has led till

121
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:04,330
damage of continues till the processes
technological processes

122
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:10,290
down in the end Aldea 2014 in December
there was

123
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,930
louder significant the titration

124
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:17,910
incident one Jorma

125
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:22,540
stayed to information security

126
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:26,630
energy and publishing information about
the fact that in one

127
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:32,979
of steel mills in Germany 22 packard
attack against it

128
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:36,599
one of domain furnaces

129
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:42,130
was not able to be stopped and the
information about Richard is not

130
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:46,720
available studio and I have never seeing
this information for details but we can

131
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,450
assume

132
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:50,760
what he is to stop the domain

133
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,550
for this well some statistical
information that would like to show you

134
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,500
and the sister testicle information

135
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,860
is in the bases alva publications

136
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:08,540
which are available through the
Kaspersky Lab we have dairy

137
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:14,050
beak

138
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:23,910
set of sensors installed in our network
and we get information from the Census

139
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,150
it's a cloud technology

140
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:29,590
and and pieces of Lollis solve the
sensor based data

141
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:33,830
in our cloud we can come to conclusion

142
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:37,820
that I'm those computers

143
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,230
learn we

144
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:44,040
have certain Skyler software being
installed:

145
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,630
we'd eat find a number of
vulnerabilities

146
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:53,589
course this has to be taken
consideration

147
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:56,610
because information from these computers

148
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:01,750
which

149
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:07,930
biological and physical location they
can deliver information to the

150
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:11,300
internet in other words

151
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,620
these computers these are not specific
computers

152
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,060
for industrial facilities but
nevertheless

153
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,970
and there's a big volume of information
those computers and considered this

154
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,580
computer is aware this kinda software
has

155
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:29,700
has love the liabilities including I
left working

156
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,740
vulnerabilities 0 which have been years
so long time ago

157
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,460
they still up president those computers
and they have not been cleaved

158
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:42,310
big values so the

159
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,580
lower graph shows you that

160
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,670
nombre of detected

161
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:52,370
vulnerabilities is Scott Sir big growing

162
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:56,709
and crawls very fast well

163
00:10:56,709 --> 00:11:00,060
if we look a decent

164
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,440
ICS search statistics the statistics
shows just as number of

165
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,740
incidents it's not the abilities but
faced incidence

166
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,430
and information about this incident
sometimes public sometimes it's not

167
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,380
funny but this is

168
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,420
the public report from American state
was Asian and

169
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,550
according to De statistics the biggest
number of

170
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,870
incidence are in oil and gas industry

171
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:29,080
electrical energy industry
transportation

172
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,279
hydro and nuclear power plants and main
reasons for those

173
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:36,330
incidence are human factor

174
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,000
operators or administrator s

175
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,980
by miss actions day having properly use
of two and hot

176
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,300
were and elected the information in the

177
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,630
network well look in the same statistics
and the statistics also

178
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:54,110
published this is where you can discover
it in Internet

179
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:58,970
and the our special lease from Kaspersky
Lab also published a summary statistics

180
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:02,050
and somebody can McAfee also publish
this information

181
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:06,000
and it's a very significant this a very
significant numbers

182
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,850
the fact which is significant is that
the swell mold

183
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:13,560
tax which

184
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,880
tackle systems

185
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:23,290
apcs systems are in a very concerned
condition for example Stuxnet was

186
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,370
discovered in the year 2010

187
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:29,820
however it was active in Hayden
condition since the a 2005

188
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,880
so it was a five year as it was
operating

189
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,060
and nobody even knew about it and
similar statistics

190
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,190
also tells us that

191
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:44,080
similar situations similar

192
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,720
incidence of a virus campaigns are
heading in other industries

193
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,640
if you look at the spreadsheet you will
see that from three to nine years

194
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,130
sometimes these malicious code can stay

195
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:02,600
I'm detect which means

196
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,050
that everything which happens right now

197
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,160
18 he PCS networks in

198
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,580
in office networks because it's also
related to office networks

199
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,570
every wish happens with these networks
in our computers

200
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:21,220
well will have a lot will haven't
learned about it in three to five years

201
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,580
buddies virus attacks which have been to
them right now so

202
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,760
eat want to take measures of information
security

203
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,410
well this is very important in specially
this is important for the systems of

204
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:37,430
automated process control systems the
BCS once again i would like to bring to

205
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,930
your attention

206
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,680
to those factors which

207
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,880
dairy often prefent us prevent

208
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,030
organizations from being a lot of
attention to

209
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:51,350
information security measures so what
the calmest

210
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:56,790
the most common ones the most common
problems

211
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:02,130
or the reasons due to which mazes
onerous or business designers are people

212
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:05,890
who are responsible for business
operations well people

213
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:10,520
hook must be responsible for security
and they don't want to apply Dez

214
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,880
information security measures first
reason the common

215
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,340
measure is dead they say that our system
is isolated

216
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:22,530
so our network is not connected to the
internet

217
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:28,440
8 exists ASM isolated cases so due to
this reason

218
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,260
why shouldn't take any measures to
protect it

219
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:39,690
well autobahn experience

220
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:42,930
in under the experience of our partners
like positive knowledge is

221
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:46,050
and many other research organizations
which do

222
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:50,320
banned testing and other similar studies
and this is also related

223
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,750
to such a common opinion

224
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,630
this committee in is specific not
wonderful Russia it happens globally

225
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,240
million most of the business

226
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,950
holders owners of automated process
control systems dating that if the

227
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,680
system is disconnected from the Internet

228
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,460
they shouldn't take any measures well
the big number of researches and

229
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:17,360
ours it's Don with such companies tells
us that information channels do exist

230
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,950
even EF

231
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:26,390
there are either Gabz or even heave the

232
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:31,200
informational mean process control
system physically is disconnected from

233
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,820
the

234
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,300
external networks in these cases that
are

235
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,350
informational flows and these
informational

236
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:43,330
leaks leak could happen through
connected carriers

237
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:47,420
or through the service in organizations
which come with their all notebooks

238
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:52,440
to provide services or to provide

239
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,220
regular maintenance to the equipment

240
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:01,780
the north wall that was brought

241
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:06,300
into the but in the process control
system isn't informational

242
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,120
leak which also means that measures of
Information Protection

243
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,690
they should be applied even in those
cases were really networks physically

244
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:21,150
on disconnected from the Internet
another situation that we

245
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:26,070
often see in those companies is where

246
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:30,420
automated process control systems are
not isolated Bart

247
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:35,130
operators are confident that due to the
fact that they have installed firewall

248
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:39,370
they have first provided said the
settings to it and settings are not

249
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:43,510
always perfect to those firewalls and
firewalls we should disconnect

250
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:47,170
office network from that made a price
control systems

251
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:51,020
but the far wall it's also a soft which

252
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,910
also can have vulnerabilities and this
phone

253
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:58,180
releases can be exported even

254
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:01,560
if it was well configured and Eve the
net was

255
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:06,060
are divided a new level

256
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,980
of routers or any other networking
devices

257
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,410
are experience our live shows us

258
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:16,720
there this software itself and the swish

259
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,930
itself is also soaked for hard work
device

260
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:23,209
which has its own vulnerabilities and
this from their abilities are being

261
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,370
exploited by D

262
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:27,829
malicious code another me if which
exists

263
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:34,990
in the ABC es world it sounds the
following the way

264
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,200
on it what's up very complex

265
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,640
decrease exists this equipment is not
used by anybody else nobody knows about

266
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,350
this equipment so if nobody knows about
this equipment nobody can break it

267
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:49,160
well this is also mirrored this is also
missed a festival

268
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,360
in order to break a complex system you
don't have to know about all this

269
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,330
particular it is

270
00:17:54,330 --> 00:18:00,520
best for state and the second thing lost
love this equipment

271
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,150
is available lot only for that but

272
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,750
ticklish system but also available for
the research

273
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:15,470
for purposes usually a

274
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,590
it is very expensive equipment and

275
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,990
common platforms like a bee or are some
honor

276
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:26,440
platforms you can by use equipment

277
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:34,520
which will not cause such big money so

278
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:41,200
these maze is Olson miss another

279
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,280
opinion which exists in a in this world
is that

280
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,450
all responsible too emotional systems
are equipped with

281
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:50,950
failsafe equipment and these failsafe
equipping is

282
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:54,299
able to prevent any affairs yes

283
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:58,799
it's true it can prevent a lot of a
virus and these failsafe

284
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:04,470
week looter is reliable and experience
and their utilization

285
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:09,549
is a experience which counts decades in
does it have to Cajun

286
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:12,740
they work pretty well that they protect
from those

287
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:18,410
incidence whose experience is already
well-known choice

288
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:22,049
in other words the fact is that

289
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:32,100
IT systems information systems and a
vulnerability news

290
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,690
present a new phenomenon

291
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:37,610
and this is a new phenomenon it for the
world of

292
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,669
apcs what does it mean to us well

293
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:48,679
I can make an example does nor fail-safe
system

294
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:52,409
which will prove and

295
00:19:52,409 --> 00:19:58,600
switching on and hole for net electric
networks with a frequency 50 overs

296
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,820
or twenty alert so nobody can imagine
that somebody it will do

297
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:07,230
something like that and we'll the move
the switch with such a statement

298
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:10,279
people have not been doing that like
that before so

299
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:13,370
there was no fail protection because it
had bad helping

300
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:17,000
well really help automated control
systems

301
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,899
this can be achieved easily missus
number one number two

302
00:20:20,899 --> 00:20:24,620
the danger is not all native faults or

303
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,889
incidence by the danger can be

304
00:20:27,889 --> 00:20:31,639
India where of equipment axis have shown
us that

305
00:20:31,639 --> 00:20:35,659
all these feel safe measure has been
taken its lumps

306
00:20:35,659 --> 00:20:40,600
they didn't work any case when the

307
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,250
one tour bind was centrifuges

308
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,750
they have been working critical notes
and they just simply

309
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:52,690
word of they have not been

310
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,070
exceeding the aboard the fail saves on

311
00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:00,350
but at the time of the operation was
much higher

312
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:04,710
them calculated time for the operation
this is also under attack

313
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:10,080
against such systems so what I'd like to
tell you the fail-safe protection

314
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,370
well you should rely on it he you speak
about threats from the point of view of

315
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:20,190
informational control systems

316
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:23,460
and another common

317
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:28,399
me maybe it's less common today some
people think that

318
00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:33,549
well of facility is located so far away
it's a small transformer

319
00:21:33,549 --> 00:21:37,019
who needs to break it who were born
Screven

320
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:41,010
wants to do any attacks against believe
me

321
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:44,950
I is for informational system

322
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:48,179
these opinions is wrong one

323
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:52,100
fractious that truthfully speaking

324
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,799
even though be these ob-gyn is nor

325
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:59,840
in the framework of interests in these
not significant to

326
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,600
the process and the fact that does does
in San

327
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:09,010
thousands dozens of thousands of the
soldiers by the fact is

328
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:13,630
you also have to understand that
information technologies

329
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,720
there's such a property class

330
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,799
hi reba TVT

331
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:23,600
and it's easy to repeat the software
court it's difficult to develop for the

332
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,190
custom but it's easy to repeated for
development unit qualification unit

333
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,799
spaceship special lease

334
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:35,010
complex equipment bod after least
malicious court was developed

335
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:38,740
its utilization its reputation for

336
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:42,559
any other malicious purposes well
believe me it does need any effort

337
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,940
no and we do know a lot examples like

338
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:52,299
to for example same stocks and exit

339
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:56,110
conclusion we came after it tells us
that

340
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:59,519
all these Kompleks well developed
software

341
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:03,110
modules in one here day started

342
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,740
appearing is

343
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,860
in as a soft-core which attacks

344
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,740
bank remote systems ATM's

345
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:15,990
so they've been taking those more chose
and release more shows that were

346
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:19,650
available in Internet have the used to

347
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:25,660
for their criminal purposes so

348
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:29,370
once created my luscious cock delicious
caught

349
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:33,490
can easily be competent acids which
tells us

350
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:36,750
which tells us that it's not necessary

351
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,820
to be a target to become untreated

352
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:43,100
so the most negative 5 of

353
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:53,639
police stories is that you can

354
00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:57,209
to yourself protected if you don't take
any protective measures

355
00:23:57,209 --> 00:24:01,329
and right now would like to speak about

356
00:24:01,329 --> 00:24:06,279
which technologies

357
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:10,070
could be used by us mean I've been
telling you

358
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:13,579
money differences Bennett told you

359
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:16,829
the bar to be accepted dangers and
threats in

360
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:21,519
right now let's speak about how showed

361
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:25,669
the properly protect ourselves which
method should apply

362
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:29,269
if office matters are not applied which
other matters we should use

363
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:32,919
and this reference based mortal that was

364
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:36,450
given in the standard I see many flash

365
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:39,469
the Sun and five this is also a marriage
was she Asian

366
00:24:39,469 --> 00:24:45,849
industrial standards it consists of
several levels

367
00:24:45,849 --> 00:24:50,669
the toplevel is it includes a business
intelligence systems

368
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:53,859
mass systems

369
00:24:53,859 --> 00:25:00,399
medium level so-called

370
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:05,129
Scott a assistance or apcs systems

371
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:08,700
operator stations for controlling the
processes

372
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,589
or a plane certain changes to the
processes HM I panels

373
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:18,919
server such historical data collation

374
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:26,060
the lowest level the usual

375
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:31,460
its computing systems leach directly

376
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:36,200
controller process equipment or receive
data from sensors

377
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,540
it's like PLC controller sorry shield

378
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:44,240
some or industrial devices

379
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,950
industrial computing systems which
showed dedicated for direct contact with

380
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:49,670
the equipment

381
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,790
or ours control she teases or for the

382
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:56,680
information from sensors and equip
itself caused

383
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,950
well as for the toplevel its normal

384
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:05,170
farmers of questions being discussed
right now but

385
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:10,480
Ford well those love scenes which have
been developed for it its notice system

386
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,950
in the other systems of in flirtations

387
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:17,120
and able adequate but

388
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,690
ride a bike the lowest level a certain
peculiarities that was speaking about

389
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:29,270
18 my first slides and this is world we
see the main differences from

390
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:35,190
office network and in

391
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:38,960
did to the said the well so have the
computers

392
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,140
your the have to be protected by the
measures

393
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:47,380
protection approaches a prediction day
should be do you print from the office

394
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,000
once

395
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,230
and first oval

396
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:54,620
main thing is that they have to

397
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:58,600
guarantee ass with continued G of

398
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,010
surveillance continue to of control
activities over the process equipment

399
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:03,820
and

400
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:08,670
means of morning touring for information
process

401
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,970
well the 3pcs

402
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:17,590
network is also competing network are
nodes which exchange information

403
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:24,309
with each other and adequate measures of
protection

404
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,370
measures which both 180 reddish

405
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:31,590
information and do certain analysis all
that or

406
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:34,669
can't filter this information after
words

407
00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:37,899
in addition to

408
00:27:37,899 --> 00:27:45,500
all this we should take into
consideration the that that situation

409
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:51,460
await apcs is such that we have nor to
similar facilities and because the life

410
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,360
cycle

411
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,659
alt those

412
00:27:55,659 --> 00:27:59,669
apcs systems is much longer and then on
the office systems

413
00:27:59,669 --> 00:28:04,590
because only the office system have the
full cycle its utilization

414
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:08,000
defaulting of up who really does this
softball

415
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,490
you can imagine is opposed to one year
in some cases to three years while

416
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:16,039
let's see that the Moscone seasons is
two years

417
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:20,269
so in EPCs systems

418
00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:23,360
this life cycles can be measured

419
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,779
in well 5 yes it's a medium is def

420
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:30,019
fastest upgraded AP Sears

421
00:28:30,019 --> 00:28:34,260
our systems which works chain years or
even longer

422
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,970
what does it mean it means that

423
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:41,820
in time its life cycle this season's

424
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:46,740
go through land maintenance is upgrades
are some equipment has been

425
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,870
decommissioned

426
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:51,700
and a replays to by

427
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:56,610
new upgraded equipment and those morals
that were pretty just five years ago

428
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,440
they don't exist on other equipment is
being installed

429
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,039
other integrators come to the
compensator there would be

430
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,559
period and it is true that it's a very
extensive

431
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:16,370
cycle most to the system's prairie

432
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:16,970
began

433
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:21,810
they have you become a nation of
equipment from different manufacturers

434
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:25,390
different types of soft were installed
on them

435
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:30,050
and those people who do face and who do
work with the CPCs systems

436
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:34,630
don't disturb the situation so due to
the fact that issue this

437
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:39,210
objects is unique it's very difficult to
foresee some

438
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:44,010
I love the box software that you can buy
license for an install at once

439
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:47,800
pursue it ones and forgettable about it
forever

440
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,360
thinking that measures of information
position

441
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:57,980
are Arctic with well they will stay the
same for appears tradition

442
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:03,050
all the apcs systems is a certain
process process which requires constant

443
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,600
attention from our side

444
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,600
so was with a certain frequency and we
should do the investigation

445
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:13,020
we should do the all g8 all the
situation with threats

446
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:16,100
because the situations custer the
changing and we have to take into

447
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,270
consideration

448
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:20,760
nm telling you this

449
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,040
because measures in full protection

450
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:28,350
they jewelry quiet additional

451
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:34,230
services requirements so you should have
very qualified specialists

452
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:39,120
and organizations which

453
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,450
will take this process are supporting
information petition

454
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:46,680
and they will keep this process in
doppler the highest level

455
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,120
its soul right now last year was the
properties

456
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,150
I have listed sowie different

457
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:56,440
as like

458
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,670
protection of industrial desktops

459
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:03,950
means monitoring protection

460
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:10,490
and services which

461
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:15,160
well every organization should have
means of protecting

462
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:20,640
the endpoints first time all the most
important requirement to these

463
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,420
protection

464
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,470
equipment 100 software

465
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:27,880
because we've been speaking to bother
provided to continue each year

466
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,650
these information protection means for
them the most important thing is that

467
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:35,070
is to provide the

468
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:38,580
faultless operation of the main
operations software

469
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:43,380
what does it mean it means that the
software and hardware shouldn't

470
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,420
interfere

471
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:47,470
and there should be a forecaster Dan
launder

472
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:51,170
uses over sources on the computer
process as an

473
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:54,700
memory and file so

474
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,540
up every specific number of time we
should know

475
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:03,210
home in new resources I needed

476
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:06,220
to start world the information

477
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,260
protection only these conditions you can

478
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,860
design drool automated system

479
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:16,270
which will behave properly and
predictably

480
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:22,690
these

481
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:26,620
technologies include technologies which
elicit here

482
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,980
festival its whitelisting technology
it's a so-called

483
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:34,590
technology of creating close to a
software environment

484
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:40,470
the technology itself

485
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:44,140
can be described by certain process of
settings

486
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:47,970
or training which requires hi

487
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:51,140
love to litigation and the resources or
computer

488
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:54,179
another one the

489
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:57,770
real operational mort mold

490
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:00,890
in the small weekend karen see

491
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:04,090
which love resources will be

492
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:06,490
consumed

493
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:10,309
in which months of them can be defined
as a standard bonds

494
00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:13,410
which resources will be cancelled at
least knowledge in this is a very

495
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,040
important Robert Joe Vitt

496
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:19,130
so do in settings configurations and
local regulations

497
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:22,970
work and do all necessary works in all
it is shown up

498
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:28,660
this white lace and then after the swirl
will have

499
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:31,790
a smile normalize judicial resources

500
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:37,830
control or device connection device
connection control

501
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:40,880
well usually in

502
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,480
existing EPCs systems connection

503
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,920
devices control is done in local level

504
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:53,660
in moscow the facility is were we

505
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:57,590
had a possibility to do some kind of
training source on this day in it

506
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:00,830
certain documents according to which
person

507
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:04,429
couldn't take in flesh causal connection
to a fresh start

508
00:34:04,429 --> 00:34:08,570
in some cases they've been cool locking
USB

509
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:12,070
the pulitzer with this certainly markers

510
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:16,379
sometimes they were disconnected level
be this different measures

511
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:19,919
seventy much I never seen

512
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:23,550
the

513
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:28,370
they didn't have any incidents with uses
all from a while devices the so that way

514
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:32,970
people do fine

515
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:36,980
possibility to bring USB flash drive in
tonight she eat

516
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:40,470
when technological process is being done

517
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:44,600
softly and even the and operator should
only careful look at the screen

518
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:49,549
and do nothing else well it's the best
time went ok management please look at

519
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:49,899
some

520
00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:53,360
pictures on the computer now

521
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,540
from the weekend shish kabobs or watch a
movie or something else

522
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,970
so

523
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:03,819
today's technological measures they

524
00:35:03,819 --> 00:35:07,079
at to the regulators measures to the
standard ones

525
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:12,520
so from the point of view of regulatory
measures

526
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,460
which has to be clearly g4 online for
the

527
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:20,059
people to come in from the point of view
of school would you call control

528
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:24,990
all these texts cations this is also
should the

529
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:28,329
good measure of providing them with
Buddy

530
00:35:28,329 --> 00:35:31,400
and us for regular technologies

531
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,170
you restate can see the show basic
knowledge is at least also other what

532
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,920
measures but these measures

533
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,819
can be applied

534
00:35:40,819 --> 00:35:46,510
due to show that the petitioners
technologies

535
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:49,549
where this lodges are being applied we
cannot regulate

536
00:35:49,549 --> 00:35:54,220
resource utilizations and they can be
applied

537
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:58,670
all only during the annual maintenance

538
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:07,660
but in lot in what condition similar
technologies

539
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,720
related to the search for their
abilities

540
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,220
and other ones the also on

541
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:17,480
necessarily in order to be able to
create these

542
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,369
close network which gonna be controlled
by this white leasing

543
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:24,790
order for this network to be adequate
proper one

544
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:29,280
and that it wouldn't content
invulnerability so any problems well for

545
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:29,640
this

546
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:34,150
you can use this prophetic mandates
which are used during the

547
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:39,730
company inspirations well right now like
to see cover was about

548
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:42,910
networking information analysis

549
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:48,079
the main requirement here

550
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,520
is similar like to bother

551
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:56,559
is not to damage so

552
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:00,579
on it with applications love these

553
00:37:00,579 --> 00:37:04,480
is a proper work but those inflows

554
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,040
and those processes of communication
which are been bailed inside

555
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,109
ok dole's ABC assistance that they can
be described by

556
00:37:12,109 --> 00:37:16,770
large complexity big volumes big dollars
in large complexity

557
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:21,799
in other words if you want to understand
what happens in the network

558
00:37:21,799 --> 00:37:24,910
and Eve the some on the lot processes
having

559
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:28,540
in the system something specific defense
heavily in the system

560
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:33,200
we sure not able to see well it's not so
easy to detect them

561
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,760
just by simply looking on the screen for
these purposes

562
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,510
we special technology

563
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:48,290
for analysis of networking operation
what is important to be pointed out here

564
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:48,910
said

565
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:53,990
first of all in EPCs systems

566
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:57,000
as base we apply technology is

567
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,520
which are really common ones and even
mention them TCAP protection

568
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:07,280
an HTTP ear protection technology is
very common and well-known technologies

569
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,559
but

570
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:14,329
on talk of these common protocols

571
00:38:14,329 --> 00:38:18,549
some he used protocols

572
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:23,119
specific 04 industrial systems no bars
protein bars

573
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:28,160
political 1687 be there were other
protocols are used and for them

574
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,230
for that for these products we need
Olympic measures

575
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:35,960
of analysis and protection because these
means of analyses

576
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:41,530
oakley's they shouldn't stand those
protocols another important things that

577
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:50,000
these control systems

578
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,539
according to our understanding

579
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:57,079
and right now

580
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:00,010
there was a big community which
exchanges information about it and this

581
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:00,960
community

582
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,750
com still number of conclusions that
this information systems

583
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:08,770
cannot be Lucas purely informational
systems

584
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:11,940
because in order to understand processes
which

585
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:17,000
having them her and then if you want to
be able to prevent

586
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,039
native instances the system should be
looked at cyber-physical systems

587
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:25,390
and as a comment on several several
physical systems

588
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:28,599
so it's not

589
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:33,329
enough if you wanna properly analyzed
the situation

590
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:38,099
if you want to properly analyze
information that has been exchanged

591
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:41,720
between two slots you shouldn't just
simply because the protocol

592
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,400
and you shouldn't just simply understand
that a certain

593
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,510
commander for closing the fall has been
given

594
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:52,789
or to to

595
00:39:52,789 --> 00:39:56,940
30 degrees my the road but you should
also understand that this information

596
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,319
can lead

597
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:02,000
to to commercial process violations lazy

598
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,339
destroyed all the equipment which means

599
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:10,690
first %oh this information

600
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:15,589
could be available only to those people
who understand to commercial processes

601
00:40:15,589 --> 00:40:19,520
technologies engineers who'd you know
this equipment such were

602
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,760
by issue with lies this information
specialist Ian what information flows

603
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,760
only specialists could do that
specialist

604
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,130
who develop that means of

605
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:35,289
want it to ring hand policies in other
words

606
00:40:35,289 --> 00:40:39,230
come to the conclusion that adequate
measures of protection

607
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:42,680
can be developed only together with
specialist for

608
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,779
in for security department and
specialists which

609
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:50,079
no technological processes because the
political processes are different from

610
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:51,099
company to company

611
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:55,890
these special is should be key minks
commissions or physicians

612
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:58,090
well the school provides

613
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:01,060
her transportation

614
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:04,830
or any other specialists and these

615
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:08,359
knowledge state house speaker Lynn Bach
a

616
00:41:08,359 --> 00:41:11,580
additional should be based on
information

617
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:14,850
which is going

618
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:19,240
to unite the stool world this is a very
difficult objective

619
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:23,740
if wanna see those specialists in

620
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:27,970
our company San if you want to build
relations between the special these

621
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:31,500
and especially is our fertility
different

622
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,270
area mortgage well sometimes it's a very
untrue and typical checked

623
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:38,310
to ship this cooperation Bart

624
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:42,859
the systems that do exist and SP sq love
develops programs like that

625
00:41:42,859 --> 00:41:46,950
and these programs if you will pay
attention to

626
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:51,440
the scheme in the

627
00:41:51,440 --> 00:42:00,190
red collar he will see equipment

628
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:04,550
which does the analysis and it's
installed in such a way

629
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:08,770
and right now it's a very sweet
requirement which is pretty fine but the

630
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:09,660
fact that

631
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:14,420
we have to provide the continuous

632
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:19,300
technological processes to lead to any
destruction so where do old

633
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:24,270
means which analyze Lord information
itself which circulates

634
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:28,320
between this little jewish but allies
its copy

635
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:32,430
so helpful for networking devices a they

636
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:36,380
me that coffee on this network
information we do analyzes

637
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,880
car and in some words for

638
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:43,780
I think that this is Knology is not able

639
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:49,260
to put protect from the first sign it
seems that if you say shit

640
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:52,580
defense technologies will be able to
provide

641
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:56,170
the threats but in real life the are not
able to do so

642
00:42:56,170 --> 00:43:02,290
in full scale

643
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:02,600
and

644
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,080
I love common practice we can see that
surveillance cameras

645
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:10,590
and specialists are still arguing for
example a surveillance camera

646
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:14,790
is it means of money doing or means a
protection can-do candidate

647
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:22,850
would save situation moonstone which is
not able to

648
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,990
try later in to voice your information
processes

649
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:29,860
and signals

650
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,970
they can do a very fast

651
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:36,970
analysis on this network in a British
information and these analyses

652
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:40,380
is becoming visual for the service
people

653
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:45,200
in the company so the bases on those
rules analysis that were defined

654
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,840
for every specific facility we can come
to the conclusion

655
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:52,130
that in the informational network to we
can see so

656
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:55,400
processes which shouldn't happen there
and this information

657
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,730
will immediately should immediately
become available to the services

658
00:43:58,730 --> 00:43:59,360
personnel

659
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,400
white days is important

660
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,690
why can't these proved accidents well

661
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:09,900
seems that the influence

662
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:14,620
against ABC es East it should be

663
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:19,890
one-time sure aids and it immediately
will leave to the incident

664
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:26,230
well it's not true and our experienced
sales

665
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:29,770
with you to find processors

666
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:33,630
all informational integration

667
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:37,530
between different facilities in all
facilities are unique

668
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:41,290
and you can influence them only after

669
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:45,120
the criminal will collect certain
information you can only react

670
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:48,140
and not try to me do something so %uh

671
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:51,170
early stages we should be able to
describe those

672
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:55,940
tax at the initial stages will should be
able to discover the threats

673
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:59,470
and attacks and administrators should
provide so measures

674
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:03,609
which are going to

675
00:45:03,609 --> 00:45:10,960
neutralize or prevent well as have told
you previously all this technology

676
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,099
yes on loan invasive technologies

677
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:18,500
this is not in building into existing
information process but this is

678
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:25,740
external morning soaring so been more
specific

679
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:29,230
with the help of this technology is

680
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:32,299
one can discover changes in

681
00:45:32,299 --> 00:45:37,289
network configuration one can discover
changes over the character all

682
00:45:37,289 --> 00:45:42,200
into relation between old all the system
as a soldier invasive those rules

683
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:46,039
wish you defined by

684
00:45:46,039 --> 00:45:50,349
technologies and technical specialists
well we can understand that

685
00:45:50,349 --> 00:45:54,130
team send to work with the equipment

686
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:57,240
in certain conditions is not

687
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,309
able to worked with it and can lead to
certain age

688
00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:05,650
consequences well in addition to death
for you

689
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:10,029
service we ship are equipped for be

690
00:46:10,029 --> 00:46:14,039
apply in DC she says well everything
starts with the

691
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:17,480
research with the rT if you cannot
defend the

692
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:21,759
facility without halted and Norwich of
adequate measures a petition so fast

693
00:46:21,759 --> 00:46:22,329
yesterday

694
00:46:22,329 --> 00:46:26,390
RG then you can do the work well the
basis of this information

695
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:33,250
following up morals and disabilities
opportunities and on the other side

696
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:37,289
risk analysis because people from the
Information Security Department

697
00:46:37,289 --> 00:46:42,390
they should make it Leah for people who
made decisions

698
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:45,450
all possible risks should be employable
eyes to them

699
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:50,140
but if you want to select industries Pte

700
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:55,150
dole's which will be neutralized by a
particular measures

701
00:46:55,150 --> 00:47:00,130
its joint war process one can select ni

702
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:04,450
risks which can be defined by the
information security measures

703
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:10,759
soloists by physical security

704
00:47:10,759 --> 00:47:14,390
some risks can be considered

705
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:18,099
insignificant and not actions will be
taken

706
00:47:18,099 --> 00:47:21,220
against them but this is a

707
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:24,529
iterative process of work

708
00:47:24,529 --> 00:47:28,670
homework between us

709
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:32,220
and business or nurse or project
stations

710
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:38,819
appear you see very common sense

711
00:47:38,819 --> 00:47:41,970
technical support training informing

712
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:46,849
list of services

713
00:47:46,849 --> 00:47:51,890
rather big also like to say that cuss
PSQ lab in a cause actual

714
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:55,930
olympia families involved in regular
reports about the condition

715
00:47:55,930 --> 00:48:01,910
the in a info security area especially
with started getting involved in the

716
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:05,470
looking at threats and

717
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:08,569
incidence and vulnerabilities specific

718
00:48:08,569 --> 00:48:15,880
to apcs systems also

719
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,180
in the Kaspersky Lab we develop special
measures

720
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:22,539
of protection from targeted attacks
bodies means

721
00:48:22,539 --> 00:48:26,269
articulate mostly for organizations for
dolls

722
00:48:26,269 --> 00:48:31,059
in the nation's which have the EPCs
systems and certificates in

723
00:48:31,059 --> 00:48:34,569
line these technologies and have told
you

724
00:48:34,569 --> 00:48:37,710
previously training training in trading
we have developed

725
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:41,900
full number of training courses

726
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:45,819
we have developed game

727
00:48:45,819 --> 00:48:51,769
simulation game whose main idea is to g
fat and

728
00:48:51,769 --> 00:48:55,809
industrial water cleaning

729
00:48:55,809 --> 00:48:58,900
station which includes all the

730
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:03,119
equipment that wind speed about flight
controllers sensors and which is

731
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,329
other control of different exxon factors
which can lead

732
00:49:06,329 --> 00:49:10,240
to its instability it's a game and we
have two options at this game

733
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,660
a it's a when cleaning station and

734
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:19,040
days ill Paul plant well

735
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,360
its all I want to tell you little Glen
Hansard

736
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:32,340
you questions if the enemy

737
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:33,490
thank you very much for your attention
