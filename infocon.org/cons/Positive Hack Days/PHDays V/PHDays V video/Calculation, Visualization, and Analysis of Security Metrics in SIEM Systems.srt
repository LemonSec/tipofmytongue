1
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,510
realize that

2
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,590
you look at

3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,890
the else it is so we might

4
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,940
or more hours here I'm kidding actually

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,180
I'll try to confine my presentation to
you now the

6
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,310
time slot available although I usually
fail at doing that

7
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,520
so

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,140
I'll probably have to skim through so
much points the latest

9
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:38,900
job on my name is a cricket anchor I'm
where the saint petersburg

10
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,790
Academy which is part of the

11
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:47,290
Russian Academy of Sciences and I've
been experts in

12
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:51,829
information security for quite some time
and say in this presentation go in to

13
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:52,730
report on the

14
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,890
the research I've been doing for a
number of years

15
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,969
in fact I'm going to reports only two
major international projects I was

16
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:01,800
involved in

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,519
in fact in a predecessor

18
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,860
positive had a nice I talks

19
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:13,030
/url alt about service to produce well
as Colts positive the series called

20
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,730
massif

21
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:17,550
we are now running for projects

22
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,960
for the government for the public sector

23
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,340
and they have yielded some results

24
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,759
and some insights that I'm going into
cover in this presentation as well

25
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,659
we talkie

26
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:42,760
Siem projects well yes

27
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,120
I will

28
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,080
mostly talking about metrics well those
projects are mostly told

29
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,060
incident monitoring and management but
there will be overlaps

30
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,040
and although I'm the only person
presenting to you today

31
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,600
obviously a lot of work has been
performed by

32
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,280
number of people were keen mile up who

33
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,180
I'm wondering whether you landed on the
cover is in the room

34
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,120
who she's the metrics for this project

35
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:18,480
for visualization I like to point out
the contributions up

36
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,480
not recover miss of the cover

37
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,950
but while for defense and

38
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,910
tyke props dextrous and reach it surely
would be

39
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,210
person to point out holding

40
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:36,940
by this sound a little more people
weren't rules well

41
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,340
this agenda will be I'm sorry this
presentation will be

42
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,750
purely academic first tell me about
what's the problem

43
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:48,170
then I'll tell you what is usually done
in this respect her

44
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:52,280
what makes our approach novel and then
we will

45
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,760
look at some incise and conclusions

46
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,730
a fully academic presentation

47
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:05,850
just should also includes

48
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:09,040
a review of things that could be done
next

49
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,540
now if you're an expert in this field
you might be interested

50
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,800
I'm sorry

51
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,770
as since it's an academic presentation I
E have to start out

52
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,600
by giving you some common terminology I
do not expect

53
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,209
I will actually tell you anything new in
this part of the presentation but

54
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:35,390
just in case I need to do that after
that

55
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:39,360
will briefly discuss different
approaches one can take

56
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,430
ignores calculate tricks

57
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,230
after older too many partly so lost
metrics

58
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:51,980
even will only

59
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,770
beacons considering the metrics

60
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,570
to correlate with a

61
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,240
what I call a situational awareness I
will discuss more detail later

62
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:09,660
him this chapter we're going to discuss

63
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,530
different metrics how they work how they
can be calculated and measured

64
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:18,630
after that we shall talk about metric
visualization because calculating is all

65
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,359
very well

66
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,680
though without visualization their
benefits

67
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,020
will be but there are limits all

68
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:32,720
because in real life it's very important
to make sure that

69
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,060
analysts or security manager Redmayne

70
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,750
finds it easier to monitor the Holter
illiterate

71
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,700
on it rowlie potential lectures on
attack and actually

72
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:53,320
react quickly I will finish my
presentation by describing

73
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:59,120
potential full of experiments let's look
at

74
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,470
the definitions first if you browse only
in turnouts

75
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,820
you'll find a number of a very good
presentations for example by

76
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,930
and real cuts key and

77
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,290
he performance metrics in-depth does I
mostly

78
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,760
care about initiation awareness monarchs

79
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,450
therefore mostly carrabelle

80
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,340
metrics that can be used

81
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:36,910
for monitoring and those I will support
decision-making shown here are all the

82
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:37,700
questions

83
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,340
he will wanna be able to answer

84
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,340
if you haven't cleaned distributors
system

85
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:48,260
exposed to diverse attacks both internal

86
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:52,330
an external here

87
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:56,360
always such a system

88
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,110
for example you might have users
generating illegal software

89
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,330
bringing portable devices he is bi
stakes and what-have-you

90
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:15,870
say if you have well defined metrics

91
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:19,700
he should be able to answer all the
following questions like what are the

92
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,970
vulnerabilities the key vote for those
who the system which of them like Rico

93
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:23,670
love which

94
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:27,770
should be eradicating first place is
your sister being

95
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:32,260
tax right now which particular component
beat a system where an application or

96
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,440
service has been

97
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,030
hour will be compromised who he's
attacking your system

98
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,680
it's important to attribute the attacks
is somebody in particular

99
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,150
how can we measured the potential risk

100
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:50,260
for the current situation if no attack
is being performed

101
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:57,130
all the current attack what is

102
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:00,130
the most probable target of the attack

103
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:04,550
and what is the exposure

104
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,580
how can we prevent the attack

105
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,949
Auris

106
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:13,080
the paranoid termination of everything
the

107
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:23,930
only remained for us well the potential
responses

108
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,860
because usually you have for
alternatives Jersey

109
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,699
paranoid switching off everything you've
got

110
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:44,110
it's important also to

111
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:48,280
is certain the mount of time and we'll
take you to mount a response

112
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,630
to an ongoing attack so we need to go of
old

113
00:07:52,630 --> 00:08:02,409
for the optimal route so to speak okay
if

114
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:06,319
computational resources will be exposed
to the attack will be the potential

115
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,050
damage

116
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:11,909
this is in fact a way for us to you up

117
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:15,219
gauge whether business continuity is
going to be

118
00:08:15,219 --> 00:08:18,300
endangered during our response on those

119
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:24,060
that this is a toy

120
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:29,740
example only

121
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,240
well this could be a horse

122
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,669
or applications or applications running
in a single host

123
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:40,430
but in any case he have a system

124
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:44,270
inside the system we have notes if ax

125
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,410
the circles could even represent
individual vulnerability is it doesn't

126
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,279
really matter

127
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:53,230
weighing Cole it into the system all
matters as different as she get your

128
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,850
information coming from the sensors

129
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,959
your processes here look at some
particular note

130
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:02,120
shown a yellow here which is Carly
exposed to an attack

131
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,910
there are some impulse and outputs never
system including this one there are some

132
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,610
critical resources as well

133
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,190
no based all this small city of
questions

134
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,970
a good ass I am so so should enable us
to

135
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:19,510
automatically or at least
semi-automatically

136
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:27,620
base quick and reliable answers

137
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:31,540
because obviously you don't want your
experience too many like Rancho thats

138
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,060
when done properly

139
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,420
the system should provide you with most
obvious answers

140
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:45,079
straightaway and I will fall to the
operator to select a 10 the

141
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:50,980
for posts responses or she could run
some what-if scenarios

142
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:56,760
and select something that fits better so
less issue

143
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,550
but some pre- ceding

144
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:04,540
events show that well for example

145
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:10,320
several males were compromised holdouts
this is a way to read this particular

146
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,340
chart

147
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:20,050
well in that

148
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:24,460
in our example once you see over the
results we haven't registered

149
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:28,090
any any attack all the second circle

150
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:32,760
which means that I there are sensors are
reliable or it was a zero-day

151
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:38,400
now we're receiving that this is the

152
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,200
knows being attacked at the moment a you
will see their

153
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,860
multiple areas leading out of the yellow
circle and again

154
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,370
if you build some brains

155
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:53,110
into the system if you're using this
metrics it will be easier for you to

156
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,780
predict

157
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:59,430
which note will be the next target after
all

158
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,710
this is why we need metrics from

159
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:06,040
because many people saying you know
metrics a useless they don't tell me

160
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,740
anything

161
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:12,300
doesn't fax when the can be used as
predictors they can already be worse

162
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,810
than money

163
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:21,560
after all you cannot always censure that
it's only be experts for amending your

164
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,310
system

165
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,759
and it can be quite difficult for them

166
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,449
to keep the whole system in their mind
particularly fits

167
00:11:29,449 --> 00:11:32,810
geographically distributed humongous
system

168
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:43,839
teen other

169
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,990
cover metrics going to discuss

170
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,779
where this metrics are going into the
measure its calculate its

171
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:55,790
his processed visualize an ass I am
system

172
00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:05,240
but obviously we need to be proactive
when we do that's

173
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:17,569
is usually a text a plus for years up

174
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:24,519
turn on the other case when you
accumulate all this information as seems

175
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:29,620
yes I am system a system administrator
for example will be able to to

176
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:34,990
upgrading the system catching up on
their abilities for example

177
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:39,579
so we are performing here and extend it

178
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:43,490
a list of objectives for an SI am
session which includes upgrades among

179
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,360
other things

180
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,569
k well as shown here it is a multi touch
sensors are in Holton

181
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:53,149
data collection data management state
analysis

182
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:58,079
there's different ways to reaching this
objective

183
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,870
we're not going to cover them been ok
refocus on this presentation

184
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:07,509
so you see that at the bottom level a
wealth of data is generated sperm us

185
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:12,950
that they can be junk for a particular
research purpose

186
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:16,420
so we need to filter out the stuff that
is less relevant

187
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:21,600
shown in route

188
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,800
is the focus of the my current report

189
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,800
because obviously he is your mattress at
different levels

190
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,960
we mostly me there for the analytical
the parents

191
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:41,580
to open

192
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,330
and the stuff we're listing their
includes

193
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,760
visualization decision-making setting
priorities

194
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,100
an analysis of events incidents and a
potential consequences

195
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,050
magic quadrants

196
00:13:55,050 --> 00:14:03,420
as usual we have leaders this where
leaders for 2014 and this must be

197
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:12,010
the merging leaders for 2015 well

198
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:15,050
interestingly the stuff that I really
care about is

199
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:19,400
three-week even in the crossover the
leading

200
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:25,340
centers show here is a generalized
architectural plan

201
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:29,680
Siem system and this is exactly that
could actually use in our latest project

202
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,060
this is a high-level representation of
it so we have

203
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,380
deign to level collection level will say
have a high speed data bus

204
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,220
and here we insurer that sir

205
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:46,740
all even to properly analyzed on fact
the day to pass

206
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,520
is no just called it for information
it's also a way

207
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:57,100
information gets stored up

208
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:01,290
sir this is where defense get process
here in the AM

209
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:04,320
and next we SS the security level

210
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,420
less we have decision-making
visualization

211
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,060
culture measures and

212
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:18,140
the whole thing it returns

213
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,649
unity health metrics in order to
properly calculate metrics you obviously

214
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:23,060
need to have underlay

215
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:28,920
mortals are usually is models are called

216
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:35,110
attack morals and culture lecture models
and lease it here are the reasons for

217
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:38,820
having those models in the first place
but certainly this is sort of self

218
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,770
explanatory when he have a moral for an
attack its easier for you to predict the

219
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,709
next target

220
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:47,420
correlational individual security this

221
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:52,110
would be another objective you can fax
ok about multi-level correlation

222
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:56,529
I'm in fact referring to high-level
correlation when

223
00:15:56,529 --> 00:16:00,990
all the doubts have been collected when
you've normalized

224
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:06,070
cleans to the data are you feel a okay
you're a little lacking some events

225
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:10,589
for a full picture and on the other hand
he and the senate some data could be

226
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:12,029
extraneous

227
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:15,640
unnecessary for the needs

228
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:21,920
for the purposes of the full of analysis
which message have to deal with data

229
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,779
redundancy

230
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:29,000
again must solve this problems could be
swayed out

231
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,230
through automation

232
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:35,540
relax you calculate the protection or
security levels

233
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:40,040
and other objectors could includes

234
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,560
a.m. development of the right set of
culture measures

235
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,960
among other things let me

236
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:59,370
let me give you some people over see
here but this art fair

237
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:03,220
some fundamental works in this area

238
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:07,390
model-checking originates

239
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:11,329
from some of this fundamental papers

240
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:16,620
well

241
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:21,380
model-checking often involves browsing
through

242
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,640
number of options parents and a
replicating the dead ends

243
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,790
to have

244
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:32,030
expert systems conditions and
preconditions

245
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:37,820
again lots lots of good publications on
that a logical

246
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:42,670
approach

247
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,630
prologues data logs on base on them

248
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:50,480
square logical computation is heavily
ist

249
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,950
well in fact is pretty similar to expert
systems however the

250
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:58,240
logical approach slightly different and
Inouye's

251
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,550
more a classical because the reply both
the resolution principle

252
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,650
the conclusion principal and finally it

253
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,690
at type graphs he

254
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:12,330
in fact attack trees because

255
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:17,050
at grouse they would be cyclical and
that would be even more complicated

256
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:20,770
while at TAC trainees out miss

257
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:25,380
Chile the dumbed down version over to
grouse maybe that's what made it popular

258
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:31,900
the next we're looking here at

259
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,430
attacks in areas ants Pepe models

260
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:38,760
very important calls

261
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,440
fact and I mostly total shit out so

262
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,980
Western American models to be precise

263
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:52,290
not a coincidence really given that the
guy seemed to the lead the world in this

264
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,050
respect

265
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:57,700
so national security purposes with my
probably need our role models

266
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:03,280
but they will take time to develop so
what i'm showing here for example is

267
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,790
suspect since tenders for platforms
vulnerabilities

268
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:11,130
vulnerability assessment tax weaknesses
in Colfax and you know all this

269
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:16,340
relations security metrics there a
wilson also

270
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,450
great publications own combining

271
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,550
dependency graphs for services we the
tag wraps

272
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:33,239
up

273
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:35,519
only see where there's a is here you

274
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:39,279
see how it particular

275
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:42,819
tag route will propagates

276
00:19:42,819 --> 00:19:48,479
in a particular system so for example
your culture measure that would

277
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:51,789
battle air particulars actuarial attack

278
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:56,779
woods through worse the attack in a
different direction

279
00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:01,440
and a good system should actually show
where you're going into

280
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,609
by channeling that I kid to a particular
route where you might endanger your

281
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:07,529
business continuity is a lace

282
00:20:07,529 --> 00:20:13,379
so you need to see this year's
dependency

283
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:18,319
even when you are trying to protect the
system from an attack

284
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:22,539
an extremely important group of papers

285
00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:29,790
deals with zero-day attacks

286
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,250
not knowing anything about them as long
that enough

287
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:36,590
it's important to have at least a rough
understand me

288
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:41,200
which particular elements of the system
could be more exposed to potential 0

289
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,460
these

290
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,720
if it if we don't know much about them
it must be

291
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,820
gonna be a model effect there are more
girls like that there are tools at my

292
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,520
help you

293
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,000
and I would love to read an hour-long
presentation on that so that we don't

294
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,280
have the time to push me

295
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,240
modeling culture measures

296
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:04,630
the only way is to route

297
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:09,540
it's also important to discuss

298
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:13,870
metric colossus again classifications

299
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:17,300
are in humorous I can easily take an
hour

300
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:27,280
describing different ways two buckets
this metrics

301
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,280
well quite often

302
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:32,050
the classification his a stop a logical

303
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:36,010
again

304
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:40,920
I'm causing some fundamental papers like
this report for example contains

305
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,960
as very long list of this metrics this
effect could be the biggest

306
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,230
impact on my presentation if

307
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:51,550
you have little interest in this field
so help

308
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:54,800
Headley delicious field before he could
Skyview

309
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,710
guidance in terms of what to read for
the next month months or so

310
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,970
Kate they sell

311
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:06,850
subclasses as well and again I'm giving
specific example so this meant research

312
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:11,220
push a little have the time to read in
other classification would

313
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,880
deal with that metrics of the perps
because indeed it's

314
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,760
quite interesting in many cases very
useful to have at least

315
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,850
irregardless of understanding of who
you're dealing with is that a script

316
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:24,520
kiddie or is it says state which is
essentially an

317
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:31,530
APT we've heard today already that's
very easy to

318
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:34,620
certain what kind of three outs hearsay

319
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:39,970
the facts sometimes that isn't attack
and countermeasure metrics

320
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:43,530
we've mentioned that already you see a
particular point

321
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:47,540
in your graph a you want to know what's
going to happen next

322
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,880
and what will be the consequences of the
next attack

323
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,480
he can also be some

324
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,740
integrators holistic metrics for
system-level mattresses are also often

325
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,280
called

326
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,950
they give here well general reading for
the whole system

327
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:11,830
and its current health status like

328
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:17,120
now when you see the high-level picture
it is easier for you sometimes to drill

329
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,850
deeper

330
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:21,050
into a particular issue like somebody

331
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:25,730
keeping a you space stake in their
desktop

332
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:30,620
or a particular application being
compromised

333
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:39,200
up

334
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,500
so at Maine's will be drinking coffee

335
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,860
to watching TV while all this said

336
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:53,240
fancy visualizations playing their
screens and only see their particular

337
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,120
mastery has changed color

338
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,060
and I should trigger his attention thank
you should Realty

339
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:06,010
for compare it to

340
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:09,750
him simply getting else vacation is
something else happened

341
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:13,130
now if you did not provide enough
details

342
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:17,370
he could be difficult for a less
experienced system administrator

343
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:21,740
to quickly predict which other elements
of the system could become for my snacks

344
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:25,580
and what kind of exposure at a systemic
level we're talking about

345
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:31,140
I'm not saying we are there yet

346
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:36,070
but this is where we should be

347
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:39,020
cost-benefit analysis is also very
important

348
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,060
and this is what most organizations will
care about

349
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:45,950
like how March a will cost you in order
to

350
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:52,220
deal away with a particular threat have
mentioned already zero-day vulnerability

351
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:52,970
analysis

352
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:57,490
this is something I guess research law
today i cm this is something I should

353
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,150
know

354
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:02,510
write this as it gets matter for

355
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:09,350
we are talking about standards among
going to provide you with an in-depth

356
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,640
description

357
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,850
I miss simply spline thats ette

358
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:19,750
cafe back he are not shown here for no
reason

359
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:40,200
we show the tickler vulnerability and a
particular sexual attack

360
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:40,800
was

361
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,740
all take Mitra now you'd be a loss of
Chronicles

362
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:51,990
and he also also standards hell we need
to consider a particular Siam systems

363
00:25:51,990 --> 00:26:00,800
was considering a trip for the moment is
either also functions here such as so

364
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:05,310
assets discover a year since stocktaking
if you like

365
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:10,060
in Gentry and so on and so forth in the
numeration

366
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:14,600
and alice is a vulnerability says
analysis of configuration management its

367
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:23,049
own

368
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:24,289
a proper ascap

369
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:29,370
will contain the following components:
we need for example to know

370
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:32,470
which vulnerabilities exist and what
kind of

371
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:36,470
called fake vulnerabilities we should be
aware of

372
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:44,299
so this means we need to have access is
database Wilson meets packs forest state

373
00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:45,330
controls

374
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:51,669
control checklists heavy show here lots
and lots of other standards and

375
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:52,539
protocols

376
00:26:52,539 --> 00:26:56,100
I haven't haven't had the time to %um
mention them

377
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,780
obviously you'll need most of them
scales for making

378
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:12,400
kapatic NCAA ease so all this platform
since

379
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,679
standards there he is skipped their old
designed to answer specific questions

380
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:20,559
like which particular goes on it take to
be aware of

381
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:26,600
or how do we set priorities or how do we
calculate our metrics and we have

382
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,740
standards

383
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:38,640
answering all those questions profession
0 days right

384
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,980
and this is a methodology for that
particular case

385
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:45,940
me guess weaknesses and police stop
those

386
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:50,530
CW's should give him and I Z E

387
00:27:50,530 --> 00:28:00,510
of where 0 days can potentially pier

388
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:03,800
so when you calculate or one year
predict to

389
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:10,970
something to keep in mind CVSS color
does security scoring is an extremely

390
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:12,160
important standards

391
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,240
issue me a significant knowledge in this
area already

392
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,940
for attack graphs for example is

393
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:25,180
phiri is very important to take into
account

394
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:35,480
access complexity in order to make
decisions or support decision-making

395
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,350
two other starters well Matera CREE

396
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:44,400
and here I well in fact here I is the
extension of CREB

397
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:50,100
still see we have a ser

398
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,470
Multi Delf different answers and each of
them

399
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:59,250
covers range of things he can to its
countermeasures essentially

400
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,250
here I

401
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:07,630
as loss of links to this tender such a
CBC the SEC

402
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:12,750
provides prerequisites for culture
measures

403
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:16,530
so he could be in fact a reliable
standard to support decision-making

404
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:23,960
see here's

405
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:29,060
range scanning tools and information
about CC's insidious comes from them

406
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,400
well CREE and the

407
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,850
wrongly are you still there in order to
support decision-making

408
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:40,490
now this is not just a logical layout

409
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:44,740
a system like this has already been
created it's a shame have so little time

410
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,170
really

411
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:48,570
I wanted to tell you about

412
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:51,920
some general metrics she

413
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,420
that a general but range say no way

414
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:59,420
so in order to assess at a high level

415
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:03,390
general state of the system they could
be quite get well for example

416
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:08,350
at text surface can be assessed like
that

417
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:16,830
or

418
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:21,210
attack depth oh wait it's

419
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:30,050
at tek-tips assist him immunity level

420
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:33,750
I would be in fact the numbers

421
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:42,179
all the attack surface if it's a fast
attack any other large system

422
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:47,150
say you're a large corporation or a big
country

423
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:51,630
this well will show

424
00:30:51,630 --> 00:31:07,679
the speed of propagation as:

425
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,019
so indicators like this can leave

426
00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:14,760
very useful for again top-level
representation

427
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,580
or speed of propagation at the root
level

428
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:24,289
Nuti Tedi

429
00:31:24,289 --> 00:31:27,580
should be

430
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:34,980
totally impact of down time right SRT is

431
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:39,870
ever reach recovery times and so on and
so forth is so well-known indicators but

432
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:41,130
I must mention that

433
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:45,080
tolerability density

434
00:31:45,080 --> 00:32:00,020
waited vulnerability doubts density and
so on

435
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,390
the business

436
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:04,590
impacts risk should be weighted again

437
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:08,690
think is another very popular metric

438
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:12,020
I'd love to give you more details but
let me just give you a single example

439
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,090
that shit slush some honest

440
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:22,500
result I remember them

441
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:26,320
mayor around collection of workshops and
metrics

442
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:32,720
so every holes can be represented as a
set of services and vulnerabilities

443
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,420
we have this metric cold exposure the
other is

444
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:41,430
business value and risk so long

445
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:45,110
multiply business Italia by exposure you
get risk

446
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:49,930
this would only matter to a particular
host all we care about is on individual

447
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:52,030
horse but rather a chain of horse

448
00:32:52,030 --> 00:33:06,140
agreement my initial picture

449
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,560
we can actually take into account the
number of vulnerabilities

450
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,550
distances between them and we can arrive
kind of them

451
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:17,590
comprehensive exposure metric for the
whole system

452
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:20,670
that's think gives you air

453
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:24,210
holistic measure exposures fours
different

454
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:28,370
chains hops exposure to pictures

455
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:31,880
attack

456
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:36,070
attacker skill level is something else

457
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:39,240
mentioned previously there are several
ways still

458
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:47,440
measure that some cases we can

459
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,830
attribute professionalism to a
particular

460
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:55,800
action or chain affections world turn
its early

461
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,490
when you see say

462
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:03,520
HA in those events with missing links
and they selling

463
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,840
means you're dealing with a zero-day and
this means you're dealing with a

464
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,710
professional

465
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:19,770
even if he bought 0 to exploit that
means he's a professional

466
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:23,230
now the first approach is a when you
measure the professionalism of the

467
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:27,250
attack a look and a single actually can
be looking at it chain affections

468
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:30,579
anniversary pressures when you're
looking at

469
00:34:30,579 --> 00:34:34,389
known actions speaks to me I should be
B&B have registries

470
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:41,010
again we can be measuring

471
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:51,569
attack impacts statically or dynamically

472
00:34:51,569 --> 00:34:56,139
this is the more advanced way that's way

473
00:34:56,139 --> 00:35:00,060
he will actually be looking also
dependences

474
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:04,650
service dependence is primarily there
are different ways to do that

475
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:10,800
but the underlying aunties the same

476
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,540
as new events occur yield Rios the
system

477
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:17,609
runs over and over can

478
00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:21,869
some calculations

479
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,859
response officials should be in the lost
metric

480
00:35:24,859 --> 00:35:30,940
in this chapter guess it's nice to know

481
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:35,109
with the mounting efficient Alana fish
in culture measures

482
00:35:35,109 --> 00:35:40,450
I'm only showing

483
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:45,150
to financial measures here obviously
there are many more

484
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:49,270
but we're not a business officer alright

485
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:53,290
you wanna simply measure the efficiency
of security systems

486
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:57,530
so this is return a response investment
and

487
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,920
by the way we worked with this guy's in
10

488
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:05,260
approaches AC the slightly tweaked the
formula the

489
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,750
at an eel infrastructural expenses

490
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:13,270
so that's somewhat distorted the
classical formula

491
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:19,280
know this stuff I E report zone
previously several years ago so I'll go

492
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,109
very quickly

493
00:36:20,109 --> 00:36:23,750
but the lease that's where

494
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:27,140
adding at this components

495
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:30,619
to traditional superstructure to
traditionalists I am system

496
00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:34,609
so that we can actually measure the
efficiency of metrics

497
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:39,130
so we can be using for example ass
security repository

498
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:43,500
to will be having for example did
service dependency

499
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:50,570
in day 10 metric sense

500
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:52,430
a rain check divers

501
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:55,690
security indicators can be calculated

502
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:59,990
we discuss some oil and we can also have

503
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:05,190
for this stew casting probabilistic
approach for predictive analysis

504
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,230
purposes

505
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:11,050
said they saw

506
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:14,500
different tools we can use in order to
generate tank ups

507
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:20,200
to analyze attack wraps and most
importantly to support decision-making

508
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:25,640
up

509
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:29,880
I'll first we calculate those

510
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,920
girls in the existing configuration and
when the system is already up and

511
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,620
running

512
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,750
will just and

513
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:43,360
adult those drops which means I won't be
building across from scratch

514
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:47,250
will fire up

515
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:52,060
an existing fragment a craft but then we
will have the option of modifying it

516
00:37:52,060 --> 00:38:02,820
and that's why we mention that we have
this two stages

517
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:06,360
shown here the static and dynamic modes

518
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:10,470
landgraf sir

519
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:14,510
regional essentially that was the more

520
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:18,530
alone up so to speak system structure

521
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:24,320
system architecture k shown here are the
real sensors that do the monitoring it

522
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,740
submits the monetary fresh for example
we learn there is an attack on a

523
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,770
particular knelt

524
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:38,850
and its easley show now model set of
indicators

525
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:42,650
healer not only Co issue here in a

526
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:47,280
good

527
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:53,240
this is here work essentially so we are
showing here all the main group

528
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,330
indicators the sources so those
indicators and the

529
00:38:56,330 --> 00:39:06,340
integral indicators as well integral
indicators are the ones that

530
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:09,660
add means are looking at well this
sipping their coffee

531
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:17,810
well the believe everything is fine
helpfully name so the metrics are in

532
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:20,040
English

533
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:26,490
because that's how it is ideal for the
project with cover to the most important

534
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:27,830
ones in any case already

535
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:33,100
there are several different

536
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:37,230
methodologies years in order to
calculates

537
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:40,500
security measures and indicators

538
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:45,020
some kami statistic statistics based if
you like

539
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:50,440
must be static

540
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,580
sadistic a love story so static

541
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:58,860
wish me said the serve give your
prediction kilby's beforehand

542
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:02,330
well dynamic once are more important

543
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:07,880
when you're actually experiencing an
attack are you see here the holster

544
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,460
vulnerability metric

545
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:13,680
and they say it's pretty simple comes
from CBS s you select

546
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,660
all the whole system the vulnerabilities
that are considered critical you will

547
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,450
remember that

548
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:21,880
in ass is mostly CVSS

549
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,600
Creek LLC is

550
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:36,580
from seven to 10 scores from scepter

551
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,240
we're on normalization

552
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:43,950
we calculate weaknesses in order to take
into account potential 0 thais

553
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:47,420
close criticality as well

554
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:52,570
confidentiality

555
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:57,880
a whole list this the completeness

556
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,400
comprehensiveness and accessibility of
the key

557
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:06,700
three measures and attack potentiality

558
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:15,000
again we're using the wise for here
decision-making metrics

559
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,970
that usually reliable needs developed
country measures

560
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:25,650
develop I'm sorry be real or Cres here I

561
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:32,090
and this oh the usual feels he have for
example

562
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:36,070
lame our measure which group at the los
two

563
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:39,250
access description an example in some

564
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:42,730
platforms vulnerabilities

565
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:46,160
implementation impact

566
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,790
scope so these are all the attributes
such

567
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:58,090
need to take into account in
decision-making an axe we

568
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:01,180
breach the mortal for countermeasures

569
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:06,990
to that tag wraps

570
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:12,180
as such a model will show how your
particular culture masteries go into

571
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:22,200
Swart or de Verte an attack I made a
major presentation was here

572
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,380
visualization sold briefly remind you
what was about

573
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:31,760
yep

574
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,510
it's indeed important to visualize the
way security rules work

575
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:40,360
for the administrators so that he s no
doubts at all

576
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:45,260
way what what is and what isn't world
can be shown in graphs

577
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:48,660
he could be shown in this

578
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:55,870
im that it's a nested trees or you can
just a reads

579
00:42:55,870 --> 00:43:00,310
your firewall rules boats you gotta
agree that this way a for

580
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:11,460
visualizing the data is actually better
we can represent

581
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:17,290
defense and vulnerabilities like that's
what's nice about it results

582
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:21,240
his seats for the previous 24 hours
right

583
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:25,850
aunt what's nice about his study hall
said up still

584
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:28,920
time of the day able term black cherry

585
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:43,770
night statewide during day

586
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:45,820
okay show here are attacked drops

587
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:49,849
okay all seem I see me know it work

588
00:43:49,849 --> 00:43:53,260
this is the same for representation up
risks

589
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:58,230
was but about it so we only see a single
metric

590
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:02,410
you'll probably wanna seeee comparison
and CEO changes over time

591
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:06,180
any I they have to go through the whole

592
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:15,080
iraqi checking for this information all
you have to develop a skirt or something

593
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:15,970
I will do that for you

594
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:19,660
all the Rhine fact some

595
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:23,660
interesting proposals for example there
by her

596
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:32,700
came up with a very nice mortal clock
face model thing as Colt

597
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:39,940
little later than so

598
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:43,260
usually shown on that the right for you
a circle

599
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:48,300
mother shock you know the service psycho
France

600
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:58,520
Iran and the United States and disclose

601
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:02,660
s-works a process take

602
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:05,529
in fact we is both of these in our
projects and

603
00:45:05,529 --> 00:45:10,999
to an built on them so the way it works
is sets

604
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:14,499
they should different metrics in
different sectors historical

605
00:45:14,499 --> 00:45:17,640
safety FC four to 10 metrics

606
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,890
it's pretty easy to show all of them

607
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:25,499
in a single chart and and that's a man
can react pretty quickly

608
00:45:25,499 --> 00:45:31,390
tits with a little bit of trainee

609
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:34,930
the administrator should be able to
react very quickly

610
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:47,339
now

611
00:45:47,339 --> 00:45:50,829
if you have a green cord manning the
system it will be different

612
00:45:50,829 --> 00:45:54,609
Xperia Sola Rachel will react very
quickly

613
00:45:54,609 --> 00:45:59,979
so we actually played with it and try to
represent see it differently

614
00:45:59,979 --> 00:46:05,440
is seen there are several SUVs here so

615
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,910
them bigger the rectangle

616
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:13,099
the higher the criticality

617
00:46:13,099 --> 00:46:17,709
while the colored and knows the level of

618
00:46:17,709 --> 00:46:31,080
exposure ik whether it's a serious
weakness or not

619
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:31,430
see

620
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:34,880
European and North Dakota propose that
holy modal

621
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,320
she said away only take him at a site
called

622
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:42,440
split into several sections the current
stake in the

623
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,440
shown in the center and holders

624
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:52,860
states are shown closer to the parade
free he can also play with the sizeof

625
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:53,680
the sector

626
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:59,830
shell said and Theresia

627
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:04,760
using color coding shouldn't be too many
colors

628
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,920
rights to make sure there is no
confusion only

629
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:16,390
administrators side all

630
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:19,990
but this is what previously mentioned
attack probability

631
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:24,870
tight impact was criticality level where
we talked about four indicators he

632
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:25,430
writes

633
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:28,940
this is exactly

634
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:31,970
home many indicators he needs

635
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:38,290
for situation awareness purposes see you
need to know

636
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:42,490
whether particular parts of the system

637
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:46,790
is being tax what kind of probable sorry
whether a particular local

638
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:54,790
exists will be the probability of an
attack or exposure

639
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:56,800
tricia is a potential Glee

640
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,110
he came he is in order to represent

641
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:04,790
/url really matters for diverse culture
measure

642
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:11,670
me am I say why do we need a fancy
circle like that we can't just show it

643
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:16,170
table you know what I've been to Japan
and at a conference

644
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:20,650
in Japan they showed a research system

645
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:24,390
it's essentially kind of an experimental

646
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:30,150
dashboards for nuclear power plant
generally looks like

647
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:33,910
a column in a pasture

648
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:37,770
and you know you might think Ill

649
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:42,510
what was this Olga to do with a nuclear
power plant

650
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:47,030
its was a research experiment being at
work was actually quite good at being

651
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:50,190
holding the information the head clearly

652
00:48:50,190 --> 00:49:02,190
deadly thousand different parameters
built into it

653
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:03,460
this warm I look like

654
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:10,390
in a particular network

655
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:13,999
what if you have a launch last worker
distributed not work for smaller

656
00:49:13,999 --> 00:49:14,749
networks

657
00:49:14,749 --> 00:49:20,160
you can show in particular host

658
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,959
as a glazed

659
00:49:23,959 --> 00:49:28,209
now for launch knots whereas he won't be
able to show all the links between them

660
00:49:28,209 --> 00:49:31,269
he will only be showy individual notes

661
00:49:31,269 --> 00:49:34,329
and horse can drill deeper to the

662
00:49:34,329 --> 00:49:40,859
once he care about okay this will look
like for a small or medium that's right

663
00:49:40,859 --> 00:49:46,609
this will look like for big a network
Snelling so lost spurts

664
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:49,979
assay exchange said SPK

665
00:49:49,979 --> 00:49:56,039
return he have the visibility system up

666
00:49:56,039 --> 00:50:05,469
he show serious eternal architecture a
lot of the prototype sinks

667
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:11,949
traditional really not so secretly cart
lemme

668
00:50:11,949 --> 00:50:16,130
talk in detail about the visualization
component what's nice about it

669
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:20,019
a start aids and label see you

670
00:50:20,019 --> 00:50:24,029
to connect other components of the yes I
am system

671
00:50:24,029 --> 00:50:27,199
it also support

672
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:31,489
the use for information from different a
bonus for visualization purposes

673
00:50:31,489 --> 00:50:36,919
it was pretty useless part of this
project and different partners

674
00:50:36,919 --> 00:50:40,380
develop their own components he was very
important for us

675
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:46,459
Nolie interface I'm showing several
graphic interfaces

676
00:50:46,459 --> 00:50:51,309
key show here are the integral in two
years heey

677
00:50:51,309 --> 00:50:54,499
integral indicators I'm sorry so

678
00:50:54,499 --> 00:50:58,880
the mommies see red color there in years
sister history understands

679
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,020
the coffee time is over

680
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:06,059
you see property explorer and hurricane
explore

681
00:51:06,059 --> 00:51:10,050
this is the topology were discussed
previously and you can represent a

682
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:11,430
topology differently

683
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:14,510
can beat down like that all like that

684
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:20,109
weekend to be showing attack crops that
that would be a different topology

685
00:51:20,109 --> 00:51:20,859
wailed

686
00:51:20,859 --> 00:51:31,150
so again we're using color cozy here

687
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:34,780
and this was the particular

688
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:48,490
go either way ist up

689
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:53,020
haterz was one of our partners a problem
now

690
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:57,650
these guys are responsible for the
information supports

691
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:00,930
cheering Olympics so we in fact

692
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:04,859
recreated this structure for the Beijing
Olympics

693
00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:10,750
so we have the external segments DMZ

694
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:14,390
we have the Olympic Games non-story
trade on %uh through the internal

695
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:16,210
network for the wireless

696
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:20,400
devices so this system that says he is
by the journalists

697
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,660
it's all seized sell tickets and provide
information on

698
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:28,829
individual tournaments

699
00:52:28,829 --> 00:52:32,260
say core game system awards host the

700
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:36,540
accreditation server where all the key
credentials will need to be maintained

701
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,630
may have firewalls

702
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:43,640
have here spree boring skim through it

703
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:48,369
we played a bit

704
00:52:48,369 --> 00:52:52,030
with Boehner those vulnerabilities side
eighties

705
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:55,990
funny airsoft Taylor funnels

706
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:59,109
and this was the initial

707
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:02,880
level all for vulnerability where
security over the horse

708
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,430
but after we reconfigure the network

709
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:14,170
a change to something like that know you
can compare the two pictures

710
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:21,339
there are different ways to do yet
there's a lazy Shin

711
00:53:21,339 --> 00:53:35,210
so would perform the psychological
experiment

712
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:43,400
usability there are several operations
involved in the project

713
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,190
so they played with the interface

714
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:48,870
and they said well in days much better
than what we had before

715
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:52,750
and they say well we should make it by
the racing

716
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:57,050
it's all happening at the moment though

717
00:53:57,050 --> 00:54:03,290
I'm wrapping up now

718
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:10,120
right this is an academic presentation
so in need a conclusion part

719
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:15,380
okay I covered see current state of
affairs in this industry

720
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:18,840
I gave you a listing of all the tools
and methodologies

721
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:23,050
exists in this area elsa provide a kind
of comparison

722
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:26,260
I also present our own solution

723
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:31,100
a house polling benefits first that
enables you to

724
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:35,710
assess the overall state of the system
and also supports proactive monitoring

725
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:36,510
any

726
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:39,870
support decision making in terms of
developing countermeasures

727
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:44,010
well we can also play with the body of
sin areas

728
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:47,360
you can actually

729
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:51,440
simulate insists on whether a particular
culture measure is going to outline

730
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,990
business continuity weather is going to
thwart an attack or not

731
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:59,090
they has been and number of publications
well

732
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:03,190
for example this presentation will be
available on the web sites and again at

733
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:05,280
least any particular reference is here

734
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,960
most see you will notice of these
publications are in English

735
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:13,220
but some are also available in Russian
so

736
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:18,040
we are going to continue developing and
oMG radio mortal

737
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:21,890
we want to implement its

738
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:25,710
in our stand-alone project as well as an
hour

739
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:31,430
joint collaboration project we're also
trying to develop our own

740
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:38,299
tools that will help others to measure
the efficiency of this I am systems

741
00:55:38,299 --> 00:55:40,569
okay shown here are all the

742
00:55:40,569 --> 00:55:45,839
details call to the details early stuff
projects where working on now

743
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:49,390
and also thank you thank you very much

744
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:54,440
I'm not sure have time for questions

745
00:55:54,440 --> 00:56:08,320
I'm conservative from Severstal

746
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,500
and sent

747
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,650
reliance resources to

748
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:23,619
catch metrics

749
00:56:23,619 --> 00:56:25,480
the problem us sisters

750
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:29,170
says he never see the real picture
thanks so much weight nice

751
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:37,600
and understand that the system you're
telling us about

752
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:41,700
is essentially

753
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:46,190
researches experiment we have several
prototypes

754
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:49,260
individual components hope delegated

755
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:57,740
partners I don't know with a gold
commercial products or not have you done

756
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:58,460
any

757
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:01,570
value contribution

758
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:07,730
research I actually managed

759
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:16,120
speech

760
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,520
this is an automatic

761
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:21,860
outputs just right thanks

762
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:25,240
and shit emphasized metric story

763
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:29,120
but in fact it sees as us top-class

764
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:33,950
alt account systems and the ole have

765
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:39,410
came to the birth defect shares

766
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:44,950
quote update he's this

767
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:49,610
officials teaching use no

768
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:53,130
whatever system used remember

769
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:57,550
Eagle garbage in garbage out in half the
best system in the world

770
00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:06,030
if it was trash

771
00:58:06,030 --> 00:58:09,660
but also in court

772
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:12,660
he's to me this assumption its

773
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:16,000
dieter we are using

774
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,590
will be relatively gets have an
underlying assumptions

775
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:24,540
some data mine be corrupted some date
might be lost

776
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:28,580
so certain marginal their is built into
the system

777
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:39,800
with Chile where low to quality

778
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,940
up

779
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:46,599
I actually wrote my PhD

780
00:58:46,599 --> 00:58:50,490
born hearty process insufficient

781
00:58:50,490 --> 00:59:01,480
nations I can easily go attention here
freezer

782
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:05,730
few least message p particular I'm sorry

783
00:59:05,730 --> 00:59:11,730
them vacation snow still ceiling strange
us

784
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:15,710
East strapped have too many false
positives

785
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:18,880
it's indeed ship whole system because

786
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:23,140
a minds 20 stores only correlation
analysis

787
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:30,400
so

788
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,609
to ask a question directly our system is
based on the assumption that a teacher

789
00:59:34,609 --> 00:59:44,940
reliable

790
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:45,240
key

791
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:49,380
EU mostly telling us short term
implications

792
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:54,470
long-term well this is mostly

793
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:57,740
short-term application tissues word

794
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:01,670
short-term decisions eighties the
primary function

795
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:05,910
however there are two mounts

796
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:10,710
offline real-time other nice offline

797
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:16,710
could in fact be used to this or
long-term decision making for example

798
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:21,000
you can maintain the system all your
constraints

799
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,500
experiment with alternatives just
designs

800
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:27,990
see how much they will cost you what
will be

801
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:32,800
the overall level of security provides
and so on

802
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:40,430
but again let me reiterate the primary
function is to support

803
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:43,520
on-the-fly decision-making meet

804
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:53,170
to counterattack

805
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:55,849
first false positives

806
01:00:55,849 --> 01:01:00,119
Ann Summers false positives

807
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:03,640
results from asshole decision-making
most

808
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:13,970
idea stop systems

809
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:14,850
in other words

810
01:01:14,850 --> 01:01:17,970
false positives a

811
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:21,910
judgment also probably don't to find
assist

812
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:26,960
lol that's right

813
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,790
I

814
01:01:31,790 --> 01:01:34,960
did mention answer me make

815
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,760
this assumption that correlation
routines take a job

816
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:42,140
challenge really get teams

817
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:46,580
so we must make assumptions

818
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:49,900
level the contractors hill either

819
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:57,710
sometimes this correlation also play

820
01:01:57,710 --> 01:02:05,790
about long-term tax ok for example if
there is an appt

821
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:09,640
happy and showing true structure system
big tits

822
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:13,740
appear saddle up

823
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:18,490
kitty camp local this

824
01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:27,770
security downstairs Parkside whatever
versus

825
01:02:27,770 --> 01:02:32,920
exactly you wanna functions assist sure
it doesn't really matter

826
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:36,260
for how long the attack persists

827
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:43,550
when it talks about

828
01:02:43,550 --> 01:02:46,760
an ace of on mount now

829
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:49,980
of Lima some you will need to make
strategic decisions

830
01:02:49,980 --> 01:03:09,940
how you will develop your network

831
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:16,029
here with the kids

832
01:03:16,029 --> 01:03:19,049
much really to paint on hold

833
01:03:19,049 --> 01:03:29,849
bill here all sports crisply

834
01:03:29,849 --> 01:03:32,910
first animals before that soared

835
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:36,549
he will built into the system

836
01:03:36,549 --> 01:03:50,200
additional yours

837
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:53,410
should

838
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:57,820
I'm sorry Germany at the will be in
other dance in the same room

839
01:03:57,820 --> 01:04:01,250
him like two minutes ok if thats

840
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:05,200
so this puts the lead over this
particular social a boat's mystery

841
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:05,960
Katella ca will
