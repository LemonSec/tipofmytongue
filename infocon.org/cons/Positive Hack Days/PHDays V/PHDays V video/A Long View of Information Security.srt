1
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,060
well you want me to get a blast
campaigner

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,110
well tight I'll relates or are

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:13,040
stories or get going so let me make a
introduction are you ready

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,770
a great interviews all

5
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,130
okay so my name is Jeff their I'm with

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:26,390
almost capital and product almost I was
CT offer networking at Sun Microsystems

7
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,000
and one other people I was fortunate to
be able to convince

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,210
with much arm-twisting to come and work
with us

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,469
at Sun met many years ago was

10
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:40,649
doctor Whitfield Diffie and with in
addition to being

11
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:44,190
a good friend of mine a Cana serve very
good sushi

12
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,870
and sockets and also at altogether good

13
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,059
Bolivar happens to be one of the world's
experts

14
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:55,570
in cryptography but the reason we asked
with to speak to you was not to give you

15
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:56,899
a technical lecture

16
00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:00,699
about algorithms because you can all go
back to school and be bored by the same

17
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:01,410
professors

18
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:06,570
report you initially and we didn't need
all we wanted was somebody who is a

19
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,180
world-class could talk for

20
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,520
who has experience worldwide with public
policy

21
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,979
who knows the state of cryptography

22
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:19,479
the lack or the gain in progress to talk
both about

23
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:22,970
where the opportunities are where the
deficiencies lie

24
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:28,080
but also to have a perspective from what
we call the 10,000 meters you

25
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,229
what's really going on out there water
governments

26
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,460
opposed to what are they push but we're
not

27
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,520
we're not going to ask with to tell us
what the answer is

28
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,990
as opposed to an opinion so with I have
to give

29
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:45,159
after you talk up I will not go away
when I would you not be

30
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:48,229
accept my answer this is ridiculous why
do I waste

31
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:51,229
all so I will be sitting on stage

32
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:55,420
after you give our talk I will kinda
throw questions at you

33
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,790
from the crowd and other my pure mama
delay while they are translated

34
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,680
let's go give the top portion first so
that I give you

35
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,950
will let me make one other sense I'm you
heard of diffie-hellman

36
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,690
hurdle a public key cryptography

37
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,990
and these things or the person who
invented is sitting

38
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:18,600
here and the last the very last thing
I'll say before you hand it over is

39
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:24,210
he invented in the shower he forgot so
he walked out of the shower and wrote in

40
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,410
water on the wall

41
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,610
the initial algorithms then went back in
the shower

42
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,680
so now I've told the embarrassing story
about him

43
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,080
I'll let him try to make up for that so
with that doctor with

44
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:43,519
50 thank you very much

45
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,299
so I'm sorry I am a stickler for detail

46
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:53,420
on to know I was sitting in the living
room at John McCarthy is Seoul house

47
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,459
I years ago Stanford University

48
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:59,969
and then I E I had this idea

49
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:03,180
and then I was thirsty so I thought that
I am get and get

50
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:09,329
how about halfway down the stairs I
thought always thinking about something

51
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:12,349
interesting what was it that I can
remember what it was

52
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:17,169
fortunately I remembered it and as I
like this after making a living off

53
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:20,459
other that were sent so

54
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,590
whenever I try to think about these
great world problems that they're

55
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:28,329
jeff is asking me to talk about I

56
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:31,790
media I remember years ago was living in
Bur

57
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:36,480
picked up literally that had a

58
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,650
bottle wonderful an hour

59
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:45,090
what was wrong with everything said the
left wing and the right-wing

60
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,769
who wing in the right-wing on the same
old bird

61
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:52,129
and I think you can see it's not flying
too well

62
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:55,400
and everything I family think about the
internet

63
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,970
purity or anything sensually anything
else

64
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:02,909
this comes back to my mind other

65
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:07,120
every every approach we've tried is busy

66
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,509
fighting for itself not doesn't you know
asked me this all

67
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:16,120
I'll Jeff just or something so coming in
as a whole 12

68
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,900
squeaking in raveling I guess doesn't
bother the audience I can

69
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,870
it up with that I'll is that any better
with mmm

70
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,530
rockwell Lee okay let me ask that of the
other Michael

71
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,599
it's a real told me

72
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:39,970
okay if you can carrying we have some
folks standing

73
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,170
okay so if you carry on a roll will
carry okay

74
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,870
very good now seems fine so

75
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,670
wish on a paradoxical situation

76
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:56,340
because network security

77
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,070
carnival rules out communication
security

78
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,520
which was mostly krakauer an

79
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,050
for some reason or other her property is
doing

80
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,410
misleading the whale

81
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:16,400
where's network security is doing re:

82
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,490
basically time there were two everybody
was justifiably nervous about

83
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,990
cryptographic systems

84
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,650
well what do afterward to all sorts of
major systems or broken is very

85
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,850
important feature ugly

86
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:35,440
certainly intelligence aspects of world
war two but

87
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,090
if you look at compile Griffey said
earnestly

88
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:44,590
the lifetime subscription graphic
systems in serious usurping

89
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,630
Whitelaw I apologize I don't know

90
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,960
I'll the soviet Russian wassup

91
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,900
systems as well wherein radar systems
will go into service in the fifties

92
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,380
taken out of service in the eighties
I'll

93
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,830
the direct

94
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:07,410
failure up the crop progress is

95
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:12,750
not currently the problem and at the
same time

96
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:17,690
if you go from starlings cryptographic
algorithms which

97
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:21,390
on to cryptographic implementations

98
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:25,130
to platforms light line on who

99
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:30,840
applications stream everything else is
just dreadful

100
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,680
questions we figure out why needed
wouldn't yeah

101
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,180
why can we do anything well

102
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,770
and arms paradoxes prior

103
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:48,140
even up through nuclear weapons have a
sort of a conservation of energy rulings

104
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:53,460
your man that

105
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,330
cost about defense was

106
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:01,750
mostly speaking proportional to the
costume of its

107
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,190
so returned World War two

108
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:09,680
Naval Ordnance had an approximate

109
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,090
relationship between the size of naval
artillery

110
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,520
and be fitness naval are

111
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,260
com the trial who is

112
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:27,790
in all the information stop stop they
quickly

113
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:31,240
so in one sense it appears possible

114
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,000
for a all reasonable size organization

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,020
to develop cryptographic systems

116
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:42,280
that might possibly stand against all
the rules efforts years

117
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,430
on the other hand

118
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:49,690
and that one that we a pretty good
reason to believe in the snow

119
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:53,890
logical reason it should is true of more
general

120
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,470
all computer network security systems

121
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:02,070
or on the other hand its summer RBS for
the small group

122
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:06,900
the whole also modestly under care

123
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,490
develop a network penetrations

124
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,750
will bring down the whole area I'll

125
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:20,990
an we send something to substantially
impact and other

126
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,610
it exactly how many streams respond to

127
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:31,100
investment is not there or one

128
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,800
the one thing one

129
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,600
really see were investor helps is that
you're developing penetration

130
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,100
it is blurry valuable have

131
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:48,560
the techniques

132
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,960
and the resources to run your

133
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:57,580
malware in particular in captive
networks look at the first Internet worm

134
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,250
in the late nineteen eighties

135
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,250
what was wrong the reason my

136
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,680
worm got out is that Robert Morris the
younger

137
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,090
didn't have you don't have a genuine cap
if not work it was running on the

138
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:14,670
on the network in the computer science
department at cornell

139
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:19,620
and he couldn't keep control of this
thing the it up I was working at the

140
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,030
time

141
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:23,370
laboratory the Canadian telephone system
and we really knew

142
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,810
running things in captive networks and I
thought to myself

143
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:30,270
you know we wouldn't have had
imagination to develop this thing

144
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,470
but if we had we would never have made
that step

145
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:38,980
on heaven knows what people will do have
Hall resources

146
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,550
on hostile intention might do in
development now track

147
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:48,320
and 25 years has shown us that you know
it's

148
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,680
loaded so

149
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,020
where you know when what else we figure
out

150
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,040
about this problem

151
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:04,170
me his problem really so the whole we
can solve murders something else wrong

152
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,830
and I think there are some issues have
difficulty and I'll get back to those

153
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:12,190
well let me start with a couple
observations from people I think

154
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:16,530
really put their fingers on aspects

155
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,670
at Ursa conference

156
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:24,290
in San Francisco this year

157
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,290
we had on the car park first panel a man
enjoys you know

158
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,330
who is I read an essay and who

159
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,850
billed himself as having been both the
head of property

160
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:39,090
and help prevent houses at different
times an

161
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:43,370
you celebrate thing not church to
exactly

162
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:47,220
that it but I think it has a large green
after he said

163
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:53,230
poverty is more important cryptanalysis
is more

164
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,620
0 when he went on to say when he was
handcuffed

165
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,170
now sis yeah a hundred times as many
people were in Korean

166
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:04,430
I as when he was head of property that
does

167
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,040
some more fun to me but issue is our

168
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,310
they social share her allies that little

169
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:16,020
say that development and defense

170
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,430
is more important development offense

171
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:23,290
or on I think I actually farewells

172
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:27,600
lives a lot going on art world because

173
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,020
we

174
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,810
genuinely im network security

175
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:40,430
as core although black or

176
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,660
on which we are building models

177
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:47,300
hi make no mistake about we're doing
something

178
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,020
hasn't been done by or seven thousand
years

179
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:55,970
in that era we moved we begin to move

180
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:59,850
in the city's for the first time all we
hear

181
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:04,500
oleoyl lesson nature and more

182
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,660
in the environment created by people

183
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,090
so what Hall in

184
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,470
cases unnatural back to Blighty

185
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,760
no became I a function of civic

186
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,490
almost so all the things we are dealing
to today

187
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:28,190
will today Asian im not that we are
dealing

188
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:33,320
we'll a sec

189
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,310
ok policy decisions and they're all

190
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:41,400
common not form right it means starting
up company is effectively a policy

191
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,210
decision

192
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:45,930
adopting a technology writing a piece of
coal

193
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:50,080
all these things the comp I'll never
Africa World

194
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,490
and Sherman who is going to be who is
going to be more powerful

195
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:58,550
who is going to be less powerful in the
world and so

196
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:03,230
nobody's gonna let these issues rest too
much rests on the reason

197
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:08,660
things will call in the US the crypto
wars argument over people's like you

198
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,990
are insider a et cetera are not going to
go away

199
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,120
is that we all really

200
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,260
fundamentally important who's going to
prosper and who's going to will

201
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:25,090
so come back to

202
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:30,220
security is more important all

203
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,880
attack is more fun and

204
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,750
backs points for it another aspect

205
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,880
have it is well what about the funding

206
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,710
an my next call comes from a man named
Bruce hold

207
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:50,060
who is the header is a was when he said
this

208
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:54,870
the head of counter-intelligence at the
US Sandia National Laboratories

209
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,350
ass the nuclear command troll laboratory
as planned

210
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:02,340
get on Bruce Hill

211
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:06,390
said yeah are you doing defensive work

212
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,600
and you go to your boss

213
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,450
and you say I need a million rubles to
defend relapse next year

214
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:18,950
your boss as you know what I don't fines

215
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:23,420
or kitchen or 800 I'll it seems

216
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:27,530
cost center it seniors cost that would
like to reduce

217
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:31,880
senior something you're like to avoid

218
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,390
you don't often see work but the whole
network operations

219
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,660
you go to your boss you say I mean a
million

220
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:43,100
robles the do this work actually you
also for you we like this

221
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,530
the results have been getting we like
information you've been getting or us

222
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:51,330
what did you had 1.2 now

223
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,370
back but really worrying trial

224
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,680
me I'll more than many of the

225
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,620
nations this thing's been given where it
goes hand in hand with something else

226
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,790
which is kinda along the lines of the
offense more fun

227
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:09,810
which years we have a tradition

228
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:13,370
that dates back into the cold war

229
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,380
all notions or terrorist

230
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,700
retaliation I we want to be

231
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,150
we want I all we want to be planning to
file I'm so we think

232
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:27,620
about network you know how you how we

233
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,870
keep somebody Breaking Dawn network well
one possibility

234
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:36,280
is that we make the network strong
enough they can't do it

235
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:40,050
and very frequently

236
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:44,420
that people talk about the French the
farrier French marginal line

237
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,430
which was instantly fundamentally let go

238
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:51,580
it's not where they built it wasn't
strong enough is that they can build on

239
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,880
the Belgian border

240
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,550
Belgium was now I am may not have seen
necessary

241
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:02,270
would offend the belgians but what you
choose to do

242
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:06,740
what reasons is very important so

243
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:10,790
a lot of people grew up in the cold war

244
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:16,290
well we have to switch to parts and we
had it not because it was a great idea

245
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:20,850
because we have no better ideas an

246
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:24,790
the these same people

247
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:29,480
are now thinking about cyber policy
talking about cyber weapons as the new

248
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,970
nuclear weapons sabir

249
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,180
not thinking in much the same terms but
torrance

250
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,209
or have given up I think prematurely

251
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:40,459
or more purely defensive functions no

252
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:43,819
come back so

253
00:16:43,819 --> 00:16:48,399
I would say that we've developed

254
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,279
a sort of a codependent ecosystem with
the malware

255
00:16:52,279 --> 00:17:00,199
arm there's a lot of whole lot of money
being spent on security

256
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:04,620
and it's being spent so to speak you
know if you can divide

257
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,740
in say offense is fine

258
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,120
security is more important we're living
in a private security in

259
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,959
to be sizzling steak well the war
interact it part

260
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,990
security is more and

261
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:21,260
well you know 20 ish years ago

262
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,750
the sort it was well a revolution and
thinking in

263
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:30,110
in network security and old guard like
me who believe

264
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:34,299
to paraphrase it building stronger
cryptosystems or

265
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:37,659
basically in true using def purely

266
00:17:37,659 --> 00:17:41,539
its usual barrier methods up protecting
network

267
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:45,210
it came to be the common wisdom that
wouldn't work

268
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:48,230
that we needed and more

269
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:51,990
interactive system that the barriers
with slow people down

270
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,799
and we will see where they where they
were slow down will conquer attack

271
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:59,149
so or heinburger way at Castle were

272
00:17:59,149 --> 00:18:02,669
with its garrison castle by itself you
know

273
00:18:02,669 --> 00:18:06,720
was not something one or two people live
in and nobody could possibly get here

274
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,179
but with the garrison several hundred
people then did

275
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:14,860
good yet it was a big asset I'll in
defending

276
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,200
in defending itself

277
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,660
now so what I would

278
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,340
are you what they do art is that

279
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:31,700
if we were spending as much money

280
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:36,310
on actual defense as we are spending on

281
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:40,920
our solar interactive attacking defense
system

282
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,990
we might actually get much better
results right

283
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:50,990
isn't necessarily easy to try I because
the problem is the way these things work

284
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:56,600
something that can get find it something
that has a chance of making money

285
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,830
missed separately appoint solution
Absalon

286
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:04,840
iraq so people being like by viruses
which they well we will develop

287
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,080
a better virus filter in one sense
another

288
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,790
either it will it will at some level
study the activities of viruses

289
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:18,260
it will more more dynamically develop
mechanisms for detecting the viruses

290
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:23,520
it will keep them out and that will
solve the virus problem on now about you

291
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,320
are you know

292
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,980
your your space what we have another are
over here

293
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:32,030
assault that on so we've seen

294
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:35,350
a whole companies all

295
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:41,750
arise developing that salsa

296
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,900
are the problem not seemingly terror

297
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:49,710
the outer worker eating up resources
that might in principle

298
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:52,870
absent something like a plan

299
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:58,590
army be spared by the major system
developers to develop

300
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:02,290
fundamentally morse now

301
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:05,500
side by side with that was back I think

302
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,360
maybe this is the single most most
important thing

303
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,780
houston y rules for people

304
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:17,120
don't really want to all they want you
to

305
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,570
have certain sorts of security but in
particular they don't want you to be

306
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,470
secure

307
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:25,800
games they

308
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,220
and their unions

309
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,390
whole lot 0 for us about

310
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:34,910
back you know back see an NSA my

311
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:39,440
think and an essay in very

312
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,350
how public here lobbying in favor

313
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:47,600
are having some kinda access mechanism

314
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,660
so private individuals can help

315
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:54,060
real security take a nap security up to
a point

316
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:59,500
but the government can always get into
this I think government's kinda police

317
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,160
stop

318
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,820
made Mike 81

319
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:07,360
former directors and I say very strong
on this point

320
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,090
and he makes a claim I'm very skeptical
of says you know

321
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:14,530
even you have the government able to get
it just stop are you have all the

322
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,330
government's able to get your stop

323
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:20,800
I'm not quite sure why he thinks his
being able to get out it's going to make

324
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,860
more secure

325
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:26,660
what that's what he said well

326
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:31,440
the question issue is almost nobody
wants UBS

327
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,700
using Apple or Google or Amazon

328
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,110
any of the major companies want you to
be secure

329
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:42,330
again them all one hand

330
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:45,390
course insofar as their cloud activities
any

331
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:48,780
have storage then at the moment they
pretty much

332
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:53,960
have access to it make even if you're
talking about somebody like Apple or

333
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,850
Microsoft

334
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:58,950
who make end-user crops

335
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,980
what they would like to do

336
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:07,410
or use manage the updates have to manage
the updates they manage what from

337
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:11,510
control coach Ron and it's not clear

338
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:16,770
the even if guarantee yourself that you
never install updates

339
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:20,120
that you don't have evidence was sent to
a wide range a

340
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:24,090
that you're going to be able

341
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:27,480
actress off against updates know who you
are

342
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,500
know what your computer is and plan to
update your computer

343
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,970
in a way that's what out Google somebody
else it is T

344
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:40,280
I had a friend once talking to some
other intelligence associates Ali

345
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,820
one said said to somebody

346
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,960
you know these I don't remember exactly
what just

347
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,160
reciting you say he was expressing
pessimism

348
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,310
back you know being able to get into the
system Stanley

349
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:57,780
other person said what do you think
update so

350
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:02,010
for I'll I've been thinking about what
updates

351
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:05,730
or ever since so

352
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:11,090
what you know what want to smash

353
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:16,860
shoppers what would me for your computer
to be secure

354
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,940
what it would mean to you and I think
the fact is you

355
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:24,540
actual unit idealistic relationship with
your suppliers about

356
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:30,010
you people make your leaders about was
the first thing you'd probably like

357
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:33,350
stability you'd like to the side

358
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:36,840
what version of the app you liked be
able to keep

359
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,260
whatever teachers %uh but you like for
however long you want and you might be

360
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:41,910
able to get

361
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:45,210
wanting the might want to be able to
guess

362
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:50,880
new ones when you want but you wouldn't
want to be changing the way

363
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,450
were on one version next perhaps

364
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:59,300
without your control what are those
things is a very sharp

365
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,610
convention right i mean i think my
reasonably say what one thing you want

366
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,000
is

367
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,760
you want to be able to record whatever
you want ingrown

368
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:13,690
here but you tire on the other side of
the aisle runner these people want to

369
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:17,320
sorta rich in content they don't really
want you to have

370
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:22,480
drawl you say that insecurity on your
part I think you can

371
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:28,120
you want in you need this you want to
have continuing access to it Sherman you

372
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,560
can have access to it as long as we want
you

373
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,080
so the desire up the people in that

374
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,050
very powerful in this world to make
computers right software

375
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:41,630
to control what you do with your
computer

376
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:44,859
is very law

377
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:48,789
so we have in mind you a a problem

378
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:52,229
that or the face up could be made

379
00:24:52,229 --> 00:24:55,329
much better that use the same

380
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:59,539
the if we spent the resources that are
being spent and

381
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:02,889
I think a variety of long ways arm

382
00:25:02,889 --> 00:25:08,169
in kind iraqi security on developing
much much better

383
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:11,399
both security mechanisms in computers

384
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:15,129
and methodologies for building

385
00:25:15,129 --> 00:25:18,809
secure systems for corporations for
example

386
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:22,359
building multiple networks I'll

387
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:25,599
last night's rations measure rather than

388
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:30,019
I fine staked everything on one network
us at so easy to do

389
00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:33,239
and mean an

390
00:25:33,239 --> 00:25:36,459
are least that the reason we're not
doing this

391
00:25:36,459 --> 00:25:41,029
is that they're the major players don't
really wanna

392
00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:44,469
iraq's now if you look

393
00:25:44,469 --> 00:25:47,499
consequence I'll stalling the

394
00:25:47,499 --> 00:25:51,909
already curious I'm just describing
their

395
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:55,209
things like go way back in insecure

396
00:25:55,209 --> 00:25:59,359
communications practice saw CommSec
monitoring you listen here all

397
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:03,639
horses and try to discover what you and
tale

398
00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:07,279
what your opponents might be learning
about well

399
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:13,239
back complicates and ap this moment home
computer and network security

400
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:16,909
basic we can barely your arse

401
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:20,829
also anything secure on

402
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:24,289
if you complicate by

403
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:27,429
adding something as elaborate asan

404
00:26:27,429 --> 00:26:31,059
access mechanism certain of arise

405
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:34,949
third-party then

406
00:26:34,949 --> 00:26:39,739
at too well wanted slight technical
level as they say that makes it more

407
00:26:39,739 --> 00:26:40,809
complicated

408
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:43,879
we can barely proves the simplest you
know barrier

409
00:26:43,879 --> 00:26:46,879
establish ourselves the simplest things
a CQ

410
00:26:46,879 --> 00:26:50,359
making the Wacom gave is not the
solution

411
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:55,429
but in another sense you choir a very
fundamental sorted insecure

412
00:26:55,429 --> 00:26:56,610
because you have

413
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:59,669
no I the will what

414
00:26:59,669 --> 00:27:04,799
policies of the people have that access
mechanism so

415
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:11,610
governments loosely speaking

416
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:17,009
exist in a community of God companies
exist in a community account

417
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:20,669
so you know one of those ass access

418
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:25,889
to your information what they decide to
do with this going to be determined by

419
00:27:25,889 --> 00:27:30,960
the norms of their community already the
phone cases of black background with

420
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,730
computers

421
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:34,899
in

422
00:27:34,899 --> 00:27:41,120
years ago in Chicago there was a
reasonable enough complaint

423
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:47,090
that interpol was asking for information
about Polish Americans living in Chicago

424
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:50,759
as alleged markets criminal
investigation activity

425
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:54,330
there in fact was being used

426
00:27:54,330 --> 00:28:00,009
by the police in all in their efforts
are all the political activities that

427
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:03,220
they so in a world where

428
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:06,980
is anything anyone can be all terrorists
that scene

429
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:10,679
what are people going to do

430
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:14,720
with your information have n you thereby

431
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,129
wanna the a managerial power

432
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:21,559
go back to my narrow are some

433
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:25,190
cryptography kinda bottles things are

434
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:30,269
in a wonderfully satisfactory way if I
encrypt it here

435
00:28:30,269 --> 00:28:34,580
you received it the that they are nobody
else in the world you

436
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:38,080
key is we know we're back whole thing

437
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,149
is is in capsule and that neither of us
were court sir

438
00:28:43,149 --> 00:28:46,590
then it's going to die

439
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:51,149
after we have a secure phone call we can
talk to each other

440
00:28:51,149 --> 00:28:54,350
and into the phone call he's go away

441
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:57,720
and nobody else ever going to be able to
have access to land

442
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,639
that was one of the greatest simplifying
assumptions

443
00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:07,029
in all cryptographic by

444
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:08,580
if you install

445
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,859
third party access mechanisms suddenly

446
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:15,019
it opens it up know we end up complexity

447
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:19,259
that no idea what's good well

448
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:23,850
having painted a pessimistic view all
the fundamentals

449
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:27,899
know everybody always interested in well
what things are coming along

450
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:33,090
what things coming up what might change
that and

451
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:37,609
one thing to ask or is what are the most
important problems to work

452
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:43,899
the Park refers committed the awful
scene from a job prospect absolving

453
00:29:43,899 --> 00:29:47,499
a very large segment to that problem so

454
00:29:47,499 --> 00:29:50,669
with exceptional all the areas I'm going
to mention

455
00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:54,970
marketing new cryptographic systems
isn't a very is the very

456
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:59,049
attractive activity but something

457
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:02,320
divers vastly more work and

458
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,519
yes is usability so this kinda been an
intrinsic

459
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:10,669
prop I mean one hand

460
00:30:10,669 --> 00:30:14,229
can imagine having something like a
laptop they've had

461
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:18,840
whole disk encryption now how secure is
that going to be

462
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:24,239
well it may be that app get through the
technicalities are being careful with

463
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,009
nothing

464
00:30:25,009 --> 00:30:29,499
on good it was written on that this gets
under a but it might be pretty good

465
00:30:29,499 --> 00:30:32,950
but how long you know how who knows

466
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:37,389
keep or key is what exactly what thread
you trying to protect against

467
00:30:37,389 --> 00:30:40,590
well I suppose you're very paranoid you
say what you want to keep he is your

468
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,149
head

469
00:30:41,149 --> 00:30:45,249
well how long you want keys to be we did
not crazy and I'll

470
00:30:45,249 --> 00:30:48,299
you know not to worry about how 356 key

471
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:51,389
you want to have perhaps 128

472
00:30:51,389 --> 00:30:57,099
he or at least an 80 or 90 no to
remember that a review right back down

473
00:30:57,099 --> 00:30:59,789
as hex I'm 28 32 characters

474
00:30:59,789 --> 00:31:05,460
actual maximum millions I'll and
actually completely random hacks

475
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,470
if you write it out we now lack how to
best

476
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:12,419
really alphabet so that you can
pronounce it does what mean something

477
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:17,059
then it blows up to dozens actors

478
00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:20,830
make it happen mate member or maybe even
remember lani trouble with this all

479
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,970
takes a wild-type

480
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:25,440
the air and that means you can really

481
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,780
use it as the password that unlocks here

482
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:35,090
every time you set aside five min so you
have to do something

483
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:38,330
that more involves the computer

484
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:41,960
all seems to be advertiser solutions

485
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,250
basically involves a tamper-resistant
chip that will respond to requests for a

486
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:46,880
vast

487
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,350
but basically more will be done about
what you can do

488
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:55,299
to make high-grade security easy-to-use

489
00:31:55,299 --> 00:32:01,970
and arm and secure the same now

490
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:05,290
the most prominent

491
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,330
thing that's I'm not isn't one enough
threats

492
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:11,690
purity the most prominent ones coming

493
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:15,990
up the one most people herdahl among the
guests or as much corporate leashes

494
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:16,890
anything

495
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:21,860
is what's called quantum computing which
is roughly speaking

496
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:26,910
the physicists are telling us that that
it would respond another 20 years

497
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:31,540
they will be able to you

498
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:37,240
computing approximately avocados number
in parallel and

499
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:43,840
if that is successful it's going to
destroy all the currently popular public

500
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,450
key cryptographic system

501
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:50,200
because what something with quantum
computers runco schorr's algorithm

502
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:55,179
do as well spines like us and both
diffie-hellman

503
00:32:55,179 --> 00:32:58,790
norris et armored on hidden cycle
structure

504
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:02,970
and in OT fine cycle lengths in

505
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:06,830
numbers are the Ranger 2000s

506
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:11,940
I then you only then these systems are
going to get to be in a good deal

507
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,549
all now interesting read the US

508
00:33:15,549 --> 00:33:19,220
US cotton in yes

509
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,540
in SA has made a decision to make it so

510
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:25,970
more old that so maybe they know
something I don't leave you don't leave

511
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:26,640
unscom

512
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,460
what in moving were her cryptosystems

513
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:34,960
which are better because they're loosely
speaking the use more complicated

514
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,670
arithmetic and that means you can make

515
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:40,230
number small this uses less power

516
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:44,670
its work with lee et cetera very
attractive sort of thing Goodell

517
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:48,950
up because the numbers are smaller and
quantum computing

518
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:55,260
they are an easier target and the margin
isn't huge in fact there's a three or

519
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,720
four in size

520
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,700
what I don't understand enough about on
a computer you know what it's cost going

521
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,260
to be out RB scaleable et cetera

522
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,480
you know right now every now and then
there's a news article about how

523
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,060
somebody

524
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:11,530
back the number fifteen using 12
techniques in

525
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:15,750
that so we're up to orbits let's get one
thousand

526
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:19,070
however um

527
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:23,210
smaller numbers in that case can't be

528
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:29,200
can't be better large numbers now
there's something else with a very

529
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,450
similar name

530
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:34,700
that up and fortunate with has begun

531
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:38,929
its name is slightly be going to change
some people are opting

532
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:42,300
under a different name but the other
term was wanna

533
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,960
quantum Corp our and people

534
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,000
find a play on words like quantum
cryptography will protect this

535
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,370
from on the problems of quantum
computing which is

536
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:56,899
has some truth to it juror but 1

537
00:34:56,899 --> 00:35:00,650
one of the top is a bad term particular
because it isn't

538
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:03,810
power the he aspect

539
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:08,040
Republic vs Securities Act the is the
independent on the champ

540
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,200
west quantum cryptography is a totally

541
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:17,180
channel the and technique I don't like
spread spectrum the new term that's

542
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:21,280
being used i think is much more
attractive as quantum key distribution

543
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,540
and let me described it into or

544
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:30,660
that I don't know whether anybody knows
how to do yet that's really need it.

545
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,710
which yours the central facility the
place

546
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:36,890
manufactures keys but uses it he pay

547
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:39,920
and it produces a stool

548
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,940
widgets want them in a bowl widgets

549
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:48,589
any ships you know to one does one
embassy one goes another

550
00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:52,910
embassy whatever whatever the right
price and then at some point

551
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:56,630
somebody opens for up 20

552
00:35:56,630 --> 00:36:00,339
that moment the key was not butter

553
00:36:00,339 --> 00:36:04,660
but the moment somebody opens one

554
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:08,500
it displays the key or close the key
into a quilt

555
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,119
something like Anna blackberry instant
were

556
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:15,550
reasons you know quantum entanglement

557
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:19,020
the feinstein asking rosen paradox whole
bunch

558
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:22,440
fancy physics the other container

559
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:27,040
suddenly has the same key weather.com

560
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,950
the same key Cal and

561
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:34,359
this these techniques 1 worry

562
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:39,430
anti third-party access and very secure

563
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:44,869
against transit now as far as I know
nobody knows how to do it exactly that

564
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:45,589
way

565
00:36:45,589 --> 00:36:49,700
but people know how to do it over
free-space laser

566
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:53,210
your radio communications and fiber
communications

567
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:56,710
and after all also saw those future

568
00:36:56,710 --> 00:37:01,330
analog perhaps or is all transport so I
am

569
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:05,270
at least the garden way the sea ASI
about this

570
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:09,150
ans transition understanding from
calling upon

571
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:13,359
think they're calling it on key
distribution and I think that may

572
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:17,170
play important the

573
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:21,540
other I'll thing that gets a certain
amount of news

574
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:25,570
is call who are sick corruption and this

575
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:28,760
is really very important to

576
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,849
to see two aspects or more

577
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:36,440
encryption means following following
dream

578
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,570
i watch you are a big computer

579
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:43,560
I want you to compute something for me
but I don't work anybody else

580
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:48,400
know what ideas on what you know what it
solace and your program

581
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,090
let jim Kerr you can understand that you
can understand we're

582
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:56,760
8 in or but you can monitor I'm so you
run mine

583
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:01,230
program for me in after a while you tell
me it's time you send me the pillow

584
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:05,820
bill and you send me back this
cryptogram new couldn't read it

585
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,920
but I can read I read the cryptogram

586
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,020
and I find this answer the problem I
want you

587
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:16,320
now that one aspect of the problem

588
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,000
I am I remain very skeptical

589
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,220
that the WAC describe that it's going to
work

590
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:27,860
because I am saying suggesting where you
had this big computer right

591
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:32,360
you know something I didn't have I
couldn't afford a computer that size

592
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:36,250
what I want the rents repeatedly not
include well

593
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:39,710
quantum computing events are apologize
for homework

594
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:43,140
encryption ever to become so economical

595
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,810
that was going to work I as I say

596
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:52,440
I I see no evidence of that on the other
hand is another kind of problem is all

597
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,880
private information retreat or not I
apologize for US centric

598
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,440
character this description but I haven't
that have an international law

599
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,140
US Department of Homeland Security

600
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:08,140
you know thanks to Mike terrorists in
Las Vegas

601
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:12,770
Las Vegas you know that with what they'd
like to do they like the hotels in Las

602
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:13,920
Vegas is a

603
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,230
we were see all your records on all your
customers

604
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:21,410
because we think they are terrorists we
wanna word search out rooms in

605
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:25,810
profile terrorists figure out who
terrorist hotel site

606
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:32,140
a man what happens in Vegas stays in
Vegas we aren't giving you our hotel

607
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:35,770
want to give us search criteria will do
the search warrant

608
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:40,190
are now %ah search criteria secret you
can have our search criteria

609
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:46,310
so that the party hats there at at an
impasse the notion or poor

610
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:49,490
private information retrieval is there

611
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:53,920
they can be given on cryptid former the
search criteria

612
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,140
they can run it

613
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,890
on their database and

614
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:01,930
they can return something they won't
understand

615
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:05,210
but they didn't know because it's a
small message that only have a few

616
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,869
people's names and or something

617
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:10,049
that Homeland Security haven't succeeded

618
00:40:10,049 --> 00:40:14,640
sneaking out there that customer data so

619
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:20,420
for that back is in the matter getting
getting the computing power to matter a

620
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,529
different kind there

621
00:40:21,529 --> 00:40:27,880
but restriction information I think the
some prospect that let me close by

622
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,650
saying

623
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:32,190
I hurt a more radical prospects

624
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:38,049
so far none of this is work we have
imagined for years

625
00:40:38,049 --> 00:40:45,140
least a generation that networking was
somehow going to bring the triumphal

626
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:50,460
popular as populous people would get
more control over their governments more

627
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,109
control over their lives

628
00:40:52,109 --> 00:40:55,730
that they can Taylor it more access
information sciences

629
00:40:55,730 --> 00:41:00,299
can't exactly say those things have
happened but they have a transform

630
00:41:00,299 --> 00:41:04,190
world in the way but many others how

631
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:10,000
we're going to I think that doesn't mean
that I'm not bored

632
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,089
know a lot of things tight turn so

633
00:41:13,089 --> 00:41:17,609
into society if you look at something
you second-generation phenomenon like

634
00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:18,700
Facebook

635
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:23,279
I you see something where it's not so
much the whole

636
00:41:23,279 --> 00:41:26,920
characteristics that could have been on
a few years earlier you

637
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,779
is the social look back but there were
so many people living

638
00:41:31,779 --> 00:41:35,769
in the computer mediated spivey made
this possible

639
00:41:35,769 --> 00:41:40,289
so I think we're all sort brings we
don't anticipate

640
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:44,839
going to happen in terms of new
organizational structures

641
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:47,880
new forms governments may

642
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,319
possible up by by computer network

643
00:41:51,319 --> 00:41:54,319
respect a simple example which is

644
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:59,779
you know not terribly popular with lot
cards or

645
00:41:59,779 --> 00:42:02,290
politics completing community in the US

646
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:06,980
but take something Facebook beings am
wanna always in my mind was Second Life

647
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:10,240
which was a virtual reality in which you
can

648
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:15,470
live and meet people and to things like
dance with them and stuff like that the

649
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:17,860
natural thing in my mind was what they

650
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:21,230
or or Second Life to Cooper

651
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:25,380
for to be owned and controlled by the
people who are using

652
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:29,520
have the investment well I think it
basically

653
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,160
male haven't heard much about in years
but I am hoping

654
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,460
that a greater opens the new

655
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:39,910
social forms mediated I can p.m.

656
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:44,260
your network in will yet make the world
a more livable

657
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:53,550
was thank you very much

658
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:58,620
full for yet once I I will let him have
his cocaine and as I mentioned

659
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:02,360
when I go back many years he only drinks

660
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:07,740
Mexican Coca Cola because it is the
original formulation and come since

661
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:11,150
special class models so our refrigerator

662
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:14,280
almost in california is for serious

663
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,570
page antique class box but with that

664
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:21,180
now that I've teased with out there it
is yes so on

665
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:25,420
it's not glass bottles are important
it's being made with the

666
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:29,220
cane sugar rather than be children so
the

667
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:32,770
the you can imagine the enjoyment of
being able to work with

668
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:37,020
technology loss for every day for
fifteen-years-old

669
