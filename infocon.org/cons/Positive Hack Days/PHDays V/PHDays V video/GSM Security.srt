00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:48,690
is more than four billion it's more than

13
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,129
hoff global population but let's speak
about

14
00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:56,730
it's depression sees and about security
deficiencies their of

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,250
and the

16
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:04,410
main problems with security of it I B

17
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,630

00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:24,259
it means that Mumbai I'll fall

22
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:28,250
in order to use to look on services

28
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:48,380
big is a facility to do

29
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,380

standards and its differences

40
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:34,319
a 5-1 a 52 AP 3 that would you happen to
be a nineties

41
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,379
where the GSM

42
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:42,109
had its first commercial realization
network

43
00:02:42,109 --> 00:02:47,120
any GSM standard and since then it has
not been proven its subscription

44
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,340
and for a long period of time 51 was
concerned and non breakable

45
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,189
all Greek of encryption however near
2007 under

46
00:02:55,189 --> 00:03:01,599
to come in axis experiment was provided
when they have shown that it's very

47
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,650
possible and right on in the car access

48
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,989
you can find how it can be broken even a
utilities to break

49
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:11,260
and it

50
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,129
also became possible so operators

51
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:18,859
make not attempts to some fix it

52
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:22,810
and of course availability chauffeur

53
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:28,060
ss7 network settings it's a generalizing
addition channel it's a system

54
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,349
the alarm system for realization of
alarming

55
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:38,019
message as Sir network communications
enough on that works well the fact is

56
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:38,459
that

57
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:42,459
a fraudster can get connected to this
network

58
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:47,129
and the P Hughes its possibilities

59
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:51,269
for various types of attacks from some
regions learn where the users like

60
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:52,430
getting can learn about his

61
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,530
ID numbers identification numbers are
EMC

62
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:00,909
were MCMC is a unique number of the

63
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:06,370
use a unique number of your SIM card
police

64
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,599
makes it possible to

65
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,840
a sniff your private data through the

66
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,509
GSM channel so I shown you

67
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:21,060
possibilities four categories of

68
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,080
how this possible to intercept trucking
the first one

69
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,949
traffic interception and let alone a
bile device

70
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:30,190
it's the cheapest one it's the most
common way

71
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,960
all traffic interception when you
install specialized software

72
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,490
the I'm job I'll phone and after work

73
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,940
these software can easily

74
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,330
the recording everything that you put
from the keyboard

75
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:49,240
a records your calls and SMS messages
pacify

76
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:55,580
interception done here traffic is
intercepted without any changes say

77
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:01,940
so little its relation with transmission
and receiving device is not ending

78
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:06,830
so attack sub these types our most
difficult to identify

79
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:11,130
that they did happen if you wanted
protect from the site as well you can

80
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,960
protect bite good encryption

81
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,370
act see if for the interception with a
base stations away

82
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,490
from passive it's different at those an
intense

83
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,780
on at the interface of communication
between the

84
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,780
a receding and transmitting devices so
this same

85
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:35,350
BTS defroster

86
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:39,100
is a base station and he can receive

87
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:44,700
all necessary information that he needs
interception level 2 cooperators

88
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,810
took operator

89
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:51,760
has all the possibilities to

90
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,889
look up to the user to record his
conversations

91
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:58,460
his messages Setra while in many
countries

92
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,660
including Russia I'll

93
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,020
law enforcement agencies they install
special

94
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:09,000
equipment as a on the side of the
operator

95
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,830
in order to improve the security of
course in

96
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:22,190
wanna talk realize traffic interception

97
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:25,420
is possible to use projects which you
can find

98
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:29,590
in the Internet and assemble them it's
not one that's not true and

99
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,990
listen-only 3d most popular what's the
most developed ones

100
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,910
Air Patrol is a project which realizes

101
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:41,200
standard GSM standard interface and
helpful this project one can

102
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,590
realize that traffic interception on one
channel

103
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:50,310
RCM channel and user software defined
radio equipped

104
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:55,760
iced is Dr for transceiver

105
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,330
as a transceiver 70 s her is one of
these projects which

106
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:07,450
also follows the topical 318 a
possibility of creating

107
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:11,650
open telecom operator would help on the
same software do you find

108
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,740
radio devices the want to create a
corporator

109
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,620
and many countries which

110
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,350
have difficulties in creating a joke on
bridges the use it

111
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:27,070
and have successfully deployed
especially sister

112
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:31,590
and a smirk on BB it's also a project of
a source project

113
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:36,610
it's more directed by and starring GSM
standard said study

114
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:41,850
security issues and discovering the
problems in this particular standard

115
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:48,159
etc

116
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:51,629
which is used for all the sub-projects

117
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:55,990
is not also either it's not in the
fantasy price wise or difficult wise

118
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:00,770
as you can see it on the spreadsheet in

119
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,129
order to juneau the data

120
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:08,169
interception in the GSM standard you
don't need eighties super expensive

121
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:08,969
equipment

122
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:13,729
it's enough to buy the TV tuner for
about twenty dollars so which has a

123
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:15,349
cheap which supports

124
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:19,680
the GSM 918 100 standards

125
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,360
and would help all this software which
also

126
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,610
can be found in an open axis you can't

127
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,589
make a small a lab for interception but
you have to remember that

128
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:35,360
its illegal the most expensive models

129
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,130
are different from the cheapest one else
by the fact that they

130
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:44,190
have higher range of frequencies they

131
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:49,079
allow you to do

132
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:52,850
hoping and hoping is a pseudo-random

133
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:57,130
a frequency switch S its defect is dad

134
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:00,519
if you really want to improve the
delegation quality

135
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:03,750
and remove the flickering in the GSM
standard

136
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:08,449
they use frequency switchers and it
makes it difficult to

137
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:12,829
intercept the DJs and traffic so if you
will use the same

138
00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:17,220
not expensive TV tuner you might be able
to record conversations

139
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,589
due to the hoping a reason however

140
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:24,019
these of is possible to do be for you
will

141
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:28,920
by several does TV tuners and you'll
solve the problem sinking between them

142
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,010
and then you'll Dom only frequencies
simultaneously and then

143
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:37,100
you will have the possibility of a
full-scale interceptor

144
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,420
so I made an experiment

145
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,220
in ordered to make sure that this is
really possible

146
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,889
for these I purchased

147
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:51,110
motorola CEO 117 mobile for why this one

148
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:54,959
the fact is that I was using a smoke on
BB project to

149
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,709
as a basis and it proposes

150
00:09:58,709 --> 00:09:59,560
the

151
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,490
the film where for the mobile phones in
order to make them in the senate

152
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,450
GSM slifer Southern Bell for dinner is
has been

153
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:10,870
a reloaded within you

154
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:14,470
software and the computer with a sudden
cable

155
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:18,529
can a bache the packages that he sees in
the radio channel

156
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:23,260
see packages so the cable connection to
the computer

157
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,270
this server itself

158
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:29,970
with this software and attacked by a
phone

159
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,930
also for the simplicity of this
experiment I took cable

160
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:37,520
BCSC cable it's a cable

161
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,140
that gives it possiblity to read the
data from the SIM card

162
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,820
some experience at Celtic spirit
consisted

163
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,850
all the following things festival you
take them by phone

164
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:54,390
which has to be attacked it's been
registered in Telkom

165
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:58,320
are operator and then you

166
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,839
take it away with the battery because it
already has been attended by

167
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,380
in the network he has received TMC it's
the

168
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,839
ID number for the about phone but only
temporary one

169
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:13,510
which is given by the network in order
for the MC not to be transferred

170
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:16,670
openly the education number also

171
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:21,140
doing education a Casey is being
transferred is a

172
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,260
a key and to which the

173
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,500
encryption is heading the introduction
of the traffic has been happening

174
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:35,240
so I have removed the battery so that

175
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,910
the bio for will be able to send a
message that it has disconnected so that

176
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,270
operator for the next time

177
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:44,860
didn't change TMC a or the AKC

178
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,350
band I have connected to the BCSC cable

179
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:51,780
seem caught have red TMC

180
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,890
fragment has rest Casey number

181
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:58,520
from it than I have switched on

182
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,630
the phone on this sector bear

183
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:05,940
with their software for most welcome BB
and I started

184
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,940
looking for radio channel and started
searching for TMC

185
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,070
that was taken from the SIM card

186
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:20,060
so the next step medical today

187
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,720
input all the call problem I have sent
DC

188
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,360
TMC and I've started damn pain files

189
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,529
and they have been decoded

190
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:36,290
afterwards and you would be able to see
Andy SMS messages in plain text in the

191
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:40,930
in the case of coal if you select a
property Mr called you could

192
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,010
be able to lease in to recorded
