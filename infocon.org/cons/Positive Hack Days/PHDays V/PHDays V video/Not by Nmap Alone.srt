1
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,430
yet

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,380
all I am min trail the mall for novel

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,570
teller today large other ways to scan

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,730
porns mild I'm address to your
subconscious today

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,410
him because it's something that you do
know

6
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:26,000
subconsciously maybe you didn't guess
yet some money on start guessing now

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,570
tone this is why I wanted a tie with you

8
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,850
and so that you would think give your
own thinking to it

9
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,820
should

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:41,350
good well have been some studies showing
that

11
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,150
within the browser there's a possibility
to scam ports

12
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,820
and internal infrastructure is using the
victim's browser

13
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,020
I made emphasis on the browser and until
you can do

14
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,110
the scanning with other software should

15
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:59,470
went to all them hood

16
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,780
the you can't go down to using

17
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,979
JavaScript in the browser but for
security reasons

18
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:11,460
some people have have it to turned off

19
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,490
so at least she's set XSS attack

20
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,869
to executes the coded

21
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:22,100
an NC what happens next andy is

22
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,190
be fed model noonish it should be there
to be able to

23
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:31,009
scan know this is a typical

24
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:35,060
screenshot of DNS to records

25
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,410
of any cited as a a in

26
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:42,130
entry to domain and there are many I P
e's

27
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,680
what is the one that their client will
open do know

28
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,680
who knows the first one in the list yes

29
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,030
it's logical is what will happen

30
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,110
if for the first in the list the

31
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:00,340
doesn't open it will go to the next one
and we'll go next and next

32
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,470
at

33
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:06,650
until it hits the one that works did a
guess already

34
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:11,260
good

35
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,270
this is a sample the 10-man made

36
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,690
in they host so sometime which

37
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,730
takes to open this site so the IP's

38
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,180
just starts it from others from within

39
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,310
no and I'll

40
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,780
I wanted to do it to online but a I
didn't I couldn't

41
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,780
so I think you'll do their own testing
later

42
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,710
so in this way by making a DNS

43
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:42,070
and trained to the knew I internal

44
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:46,020
network IP then the next one and the one
that works

45
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,340
good the in then

46
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,900
in this is the way you can the go
through the ports

47
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,150
to see we should call them do work so
like the browser goes to the

48
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:02,780
new IP with the horse 1,2,3,4,5 the
response is no such thing

49
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,970
no such thing and it goes to the next
one and then he ends up

50
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,290
with us so we re-direct them

51
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,420
to and back to another IP eat

52
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,020
and get information this way if we do
with the

53
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,500
rule read and direct on them

54
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,380
victims rosen to in an internal IP with
the poor that we need and there was no

55
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,269
response

56
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:29,840
then we can make the conclusion that
this port is

57
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,920
open and exists in the internal
infrastructure

58
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,590
to in this way at any moment you can
this can do this canning by

59
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,770
in Torrance urging this to our host
either the browser would

60
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:50,010
rooms send the inquiry toss whenever

61
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:54,400
XSS that and or other on the religious
and I really can't check whether

62
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,760
the port is open at and you can it can
also be used in SSR attacks

63
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,310
the witnesses that there's a timeout to
connect connection timeout

64
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,900
and is theirs is a software that

65
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,920
uses only the first IP and stops at that

66
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,030
but this is a real thing but to strange
enough this is the case all the chrome

67
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:21,700
browser night checked a lot of soft
square

68
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,969
taurus pt PHP curls browsers

69
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:31,690
the work in the same way but the chrome
is the only one who uses the first

70
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,810
girls only natalie is this is the result

71
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,370
the tiger at so did you really get

72
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:43,520
the point now

73
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,130
measure has hooded working

74
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:51,690
less we'll see who didn't and now

75
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:56,900
a those who did get the point please
explain it to those who didn't

76
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,730
and this makes my presentation shorted

77
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,870
maybe there will be questions
