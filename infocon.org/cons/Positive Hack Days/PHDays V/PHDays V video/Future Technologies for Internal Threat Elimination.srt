1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:06,190
senior so how way I'm

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,759
cassava counteract combat so threats

3
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:14,090
service I'll talk about the trance about
what's going on

4
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,600
and

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,480
so first issuers by the company the
company was set up for

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,970
in 2003 and and it grew out of a small
lamp for

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,790
just pure skill happened on the way and
and we separated

8
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:32,060
and became a an independent company so
there are two independent

9
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,200
group for an hour product line

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,040
Acer solutions so for corporate

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,040
it. security solutions and this is our

12
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,360
so nothing but that so this is the most
important so

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,280
certain have achieved a grade your
success in this era mccusick corporate

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:49,960
security

15
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,020
socialists we r company number one

16
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:59,440
and and Sun and wind here have lots of
clients more than 350 clients we have

17
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,420
most to them a large companies to large
corporate

18
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,850
corporates assault let's this

19
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,210
speak about the the this

20
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,170
this scene so how to look so from the
viewpoint of corporate to

21
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,869
Securities said the beginning of the
century I worked as a day

22
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:22,340
here to hear of enteroviruses so that
was the most important task of IT

23
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,520
security was

24
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,510
a was

25
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,640
worst to to speed up to exchange
information and it was the order of the

26
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,500
day and

27
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,890
so then the function of functionality of
the system syn sustainability and

28
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:37,820
availability

29
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,220
so for us says has security guys

30
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,970
so that was a time to protect ourselves
sir

31
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,600
companies from viruses and a soda can
changing so new viruses new trends

32
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,970
appear to all the time so we had to
protect it lasted for a certain period

33
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:53,509
of time

34
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:56,850
until until it turned into you are

35
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,440
her so the viruses keep popping up and
so three hundred thousand

36
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,509
viruses pop up every day Paso the keep
changing morphing into something else

37
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:08,300
and the sub trying to ward 2

38
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:13,410
security measures so that the same from
this point the service so that just got

39
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,030
worse

40
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,709
but nothing changed and and there are
many more so but we got accustomed to

41
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:18,220
something

42
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,820
inevitable and so now we learn how to
react quickly respond

43
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,230
properly kinda and sure everything is

44
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:30,090
more or less okay and Emma about
something other than the

45
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,299
GOP security her era

46
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:38,000
started for 2000 2000 mind and so they
realize that information can

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,670
leak can be stolen and et cetera can
disappear

48
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,830
and a

49
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:49,020
so I called it certainly in a
far-fetched manners called it an era

50
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,940
because this year

51
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,020
goes on assist you there others in your
trend now

52
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,980
more and is trying to assess are
protecting your IT perimeter

53
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:03,090
against weeks and fast under Obama
security secure storage

54
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,440
data and transfer of this data and

55
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,830
surrender the paradigm that needed to be
changed disodium

56
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:14,160
documents were made the for my work
paper documents paper exchange paper

57
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,530
flow

58
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,740
about to bite on 210 some the majors a
documents became

59
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,740
electronic documents on the concept of
protection on this documents

60
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,120
to change naturally and by 2010

61
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,730
per server realize that to GOP
protecting on the documents is not

62
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,540
sufficient

63
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,060
like deal P does 78 just two forestall

64
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,380
other risks so which keep

65
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:43,930
and so we decided to so the era of a
business protection services

66
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,560
fighting comforting Oreskes because like
mushrooms

67
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,120
corporate in corporate started to appear
so

68
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,520
the company says so offering your
protection against the risks

69
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,450
said simple software difficult software

70
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:03,690
and a sec within Excel table that
picture flash tourists many

71
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:07,200
consultations which is a way to protect
the company from urs

72
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,110
are still young does that just guess
consultation

73
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:16,250
I provides consulting services
everything you it's all related to risk

74
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,590
for and we fully realize that their

75
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,620
that if the information is lost that's
bad

76
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,070
it's very bad

77
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:28,400
so there's no need to talk if we

78
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,840
a so than how to protect against a

79
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,500
leaks of information because at the end
of the day so we put up a minute or

80
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,010
so on all channels so we a

81
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:45,410
catch this information analyze it and
then we either block it online

82
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,710
and so that that happens in six to
seventy percent of cases

83
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:54,850
or just three let it go through but then
provides information to the

84
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:59,080
security officer so that this
information

85
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,310
I was an attempt to still this
information than we do

86
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,770
the monitoring and they're so when I
just who how

87
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:10,710
where to soccer send us information as
to the concept of GOP

88
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:15,410
and they're so now the trend she's
changing so just where to send it two

89
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,660
hundred and how to call

90
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,740
what to call it so we I say to continue

91
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,360
I'm aanu any product category decided to

92
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,090
our caller internal threats information
security because

93
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,570
DLP is actually something some extra
some extent these internal affairs

94
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,960
information security as well

95
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,390
so than in-house mean house

96
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:38,870
threats have protection but we decided
to

97
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:45,050
her name actors itis us that we calling
this new york I and you

98
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:48,820
abbreviation was a different look and
European itis so the future too

99
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,840
a to isolate suspicious trance

100
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,770
and to block so we did not analyze the
entire gamut

101
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,330
are home a corporation but only his own

102
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:03,010
that we deem har suspicious

103
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:08,250
with them suspicious and %uh so I just
have been doing that for many years

104
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,940
about 10 years so we'll know a lot about
that under

105
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,600
and they're so with the reporting as
well so how do we

106
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,020
leaks are organized and in which way
should information is leaked

107
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,340
inspirations

108
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,750
and the so you can see so for example
the channels are

109
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:29,000
are a leaks so in 2014 the Trent

110
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,340
about faced over the summer so well
someone was saying they were paper

111
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,560
documents that was the main channel of
Los

112
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,070
than in 2014 the main a channel is
network

113
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:42,750
network is clout its clout this is where
the first and now the clout to closures

114
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,539
came to power

115
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:47,070
culture alive send them sup now so
they're

116
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:50,909
happy that manages information can be
stolen from the clout

117
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:55,349
this berries so paper documents assault
became

118
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:59,150
so second in importance losses for
example I

119
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:02,320
I left my my tablet

120
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,690
attacks a car for example although I
lost my smartphone or

121
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:11,220
I had my double a stolen services has
sixty 60 percent this is number three

122
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:16,650
and the rest for example email that is
protected by corporations is on a number

123
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:17,380
for

124
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,590
researchers far behind very interesting
chart because it shows

125
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,640
what channel sleep protected and

126
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,099
so we so the statistics is so we

127
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:32,750
collect statistics on all the cages that
we identified to depress

128
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:37,099
in the world published information about
the leakage so we put it on

129
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:40,849
on the list and they're so 2014 so we're

130
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:44,669
marked one thousand 1700 leakages

131
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:48,960
a took place and then to analyze counter
which channels

132
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,950
to understand that this selected just
sent to the press this is that toppled

133
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:57,020
as purpose under one percent got into
into press

134
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,539
but even judging by this one percent can
get them in GQ

135
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:03,620
get the curse action and identify the
trans

136
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:08,289
and from the viewpoint of home types of
information

137
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:11,810
ninety-two percent personal data leakage
minded why

138
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,430
it's all this on personal data is liquid
can be sold

139
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,000
its know-how can be used her

140
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,719
and so they're often its the client
databases

141
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:25,810
where they're so did the bank

142
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,940
the banks the top databases his stolen

143
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,589
and then they say so work in just over a
depositor 2 percent

144
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:37,539
cheaper for a long time one percenter
cheaper and

145
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:41,020
so then and people go for it then the
commercial

146
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,709
a secret is behind only four percent

147
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:47,720
the state secret is only 1.1

148
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,270
1.7 half-percent this is a lot because
it is quite sensitive because the state

149
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,290
secret occurs

150
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:57,480
so there are several hundreds of
thousands are leakage is all over the

151
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,020
world

152
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,649
1.7 percent for state secrets is a lot
there

153
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:07,000
and the service is the picture it sir
certainly it's very versatile

154
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,200
so medicine so broken down by

155
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,750
industries so medicine in russia its
banks

156
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,860
and medicine his global so global
linkages

157
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,880
my because liquidator Saudi they still
patients data and then the over certain

158

00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,279
done education institutions and a
special agencies and state authorities

161
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:35,820
number three and and banks and
financials

162
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,959
is on number six in the world and in
Russia

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:44,079
banking leakages number one Anderson
examples of sorry

164
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:45,470
Taylor

165
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,900
a big retailer for example that sales

166
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,300
food and had a database

167
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,220
their employees and 10 employees

168
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,840
so stole and put it into social networ

169
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,790
information about seller is put it all
up for everyone screwed

170
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,090
and this or the company have to certain
to pay

171
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,490
Anderson search for wreckage rich

172
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,320
kinda dented their financial position

173
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,750
then the second example is so

174
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,420
banking a bank employee here with an
axis

175
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:27,300
deal P always talk about this so that
people who have an axis

176
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:32,250
Lego access to certain so that's why I
saw them to access controls

177
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:36,490
and conscripting so it doesn't thousand
doesn't protect

178
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:41,940
because he has an accident since this
candidate about the VIP clients with the

179
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,490
been cold since your work to

180
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:46,490
you know stashed passed this information
I worry

181
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:50,560
and and cousteau 3.5 million rubles and

182
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,050
heroes caught with his hands hand

183
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:58,430
John aren't stop two guys there it is
thank you any other

00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,510
commercial secrets regulations
procedures

186
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:10,770
dividing the rules access that's all
done it this is the front line

187
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,830
first thing so this is a big headache
and many companies

188
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,570
commercial

189
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,810
commercial secret malt

190
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:22,510
so sometimes it takes them years to
introduce the system and then there are

191
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,550
certain technical

192
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:28,760
methods of control and there are mom non
very good you install it and forget

193
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,470
about

194
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:33,579
to plug in Africa not they're not has
additional headache a big blow

195
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:37,070
Saunders riotous service is always
fighting

196
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:42,459
those matters there's a fight IT guys

197
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:46,079
security guys so one want to impose

198
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:51,990
other small to at shying away from it
and then they can certainly pick on a

199
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,519
block

200
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:56,190
an axis many thanks duder was blocked so
no

201
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:01,060
internet access is available that's it
period some banks do that and their

202
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,760
for example if the computer has

203
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:10,959
can get to internet so than a minute to
find the ways how to tiptoe around

204
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,839
manson's figure out a way to how to
organize a leak

205
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:18,029
and Emily will be much more much more
singers

206
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:21,350
and then so y spying

207
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:25,850
spying the staff so sign up for that
doesn't work

208
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:30,339
because efficiency is very low spying
have the personnel

209
00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:34,170
for and then a so they comprehend week

210
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,190
let me talk to her about our
comprehensive approach to protect data

211
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:42,810
so our approach is different many
management companies not copy is

212
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,870
because thing that the main means to
protect is not software

213
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:50,720
such as a means to means think that this
is a software you just install it now

214
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,000
so there are ways to protect against
leakage is and leaking information

215
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,070
is the changing are day and are

216
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,510
month mental state several stages this
yr

217
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,579
up mindset sorry picture taken and

218
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:08,630
anti-virus understand under my nurses
looking for viruses

219
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:12,620
that %uh put on the database or just so
using

220
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,649
different algorithms how much remember
looking at one

221
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:20,210
catching leak for example so for bankers

222
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,830
soil company itself one vulnerability

223
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:27,820
for bank is another vulnerabilities
power companies another vulnerability so

224
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,420
they understand it differently society
want to catch a week

225
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,890
an there's one an oil company

226
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:38,150
someone will be looking for DS series

227
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:42,920
right another company would be looking
for certain documentation production

228
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,960
recommendation

229
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,720
so this fire no commercials fishman to
understand what is it that we're gonna

230
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,320
catch

231
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,660
amicus you don't know what i'm looking
for work and catch

232
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,700
decir southerners free GOP stage

233
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:00,080
which is where do the audit of IT
security social me what you got

234
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,610
and so when it comes to work but as a de
chimie

235
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,700
and then 11 data classification

236
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,340
Chris occasion because without it
doesn't make sense and then

237
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:14,180
hand and introduction momentum methods
how to maintain the commercial

238
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,670

239
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:21,960
weekend heard do the corrective measures
just maturing

240
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,310
us software and corrective measures
adjustments at other

241
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:31,860
proctor pre free deal P a certain is a
guarantee of successful program in some

242
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,920
in it to you

243
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:37,200
to give a list of Paul policies and
developing

244
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,170
house a lot so most missed a bit minute
to bid on them so the bent over they

245
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,540
developed a staged a

246
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:47,190
more successful the final installation
will be I like this picture

247
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,110
pass on

248
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:52,510
and the basement so usually before we

249
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:56,610
where movement in your corporation
everything is in the he PC on the left

250
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:57,020
side

251
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,390
and then we launch this program some pre
deal

252
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:04,660
p everything in its place everything on
its shelf and everything

253
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:08,110
green and nice and very neat and tidy

254
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:11,360
this and so with other with cash

255
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,260
time sure easier to catch if if it's not
just lying in the heap right hi

256
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:22,580
under so then the GOP stage it's a it's
a software

257
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,870
that does the announcers and Catchings
many

258
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:29,339
channels today kommt sahnoun

259
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:32,440
we connect Morris worse is huge

260
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,050
what's a memory stick and so we're just
gonna

261
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:40,650
some pilots working on it right now on
hand

262
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:44,380
so that's that's a big list them and a
new technologies

263
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:49,650
which her so intercept information
science kind of hybrid

264
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:53,339

266
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,470
this characteristics service using only

267
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:04,990
sorry this document is not milicich

268
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:08,070
then we and impose their opinion is

Asakusa digital digital prufer

270
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:14,280
a for the court us occurs

271
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,660
me cassius services as much rest

272
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:22,390
to fire a guide and to take him to court
versus not using then I just dragging

273
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:22,820
guys

274
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,420
reported guys I think it's wrong because
images

275
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:31,100
to see you them to start a national so
the entry into civilized world history

276
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,140
venture services

277
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:35,280
this will be much in demand there

278
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,970
so they will be issued and tried in
court

279
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,330
so I understand I just had to endure
what deal P e's

280
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,620
and so what the market is moving in the
where

281
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,280
we are moving and they're so there's
another solution are still coming

282
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,540
so that works analyze other answer

283
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,810
now this system are leakage protection

284
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:59,020
is not analyzing your for

285
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:03,470
so for example so then the a respectable

286
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:06,800
pronouncements about company social
networks asunder

287
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,859
GOP looks inside the company not outside
so the world is getting more and more

288
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,920
transparent the perimeter notion is gone

289
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,150
said resentment or intercept not inside

290
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:27,850
outside as well and that this is a and
and and and a risk models

291
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:31,540
satanic so

292
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:35,040
espy from another from the competitors
caster

293
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,810
I got himself hired and and eroding the
company from inside

294
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:43,690
so for example or I just a that takes
care of

295
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:47,690
and the corporate segments as fast to
deal with the thinks it's a special

296
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:53,160
suspicious behavior for example sir can
be isolated from the basis a special

297
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,930
behavior

298
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,620
behavioral patterns

299
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,029
behaviorist except so than a

300
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:03,450
found a chart of for connections
relationships and isolate

301
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,960
suspicious relations

302
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,370
or which ad hoc communications because

303
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:13,730
it may be just a love affair or maybe
collusion

304
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:17,929
you don't know what that is and thus
eliminate year

305
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:22,820
is at work putting together a certain
product research consulting plus

306
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:26,460
plus software which alone

307
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,840
the lines are certain principles isolate
suspicious

308
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,139
points and then sign does a suspicious

309
00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:38,120
I'm once we identify so that people
should

310
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:43,460
hand by hand so using their eyes their
hand stamped work with those suspicions

311
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,230
guys

312
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:47,649
and that Parise is a great deal of
suspicion with us

313
00:18:47,649 --> 00:18:51,860
and that's how we analyze and so we can
prevent

314
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,110
high-risk servicos mode but

315
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:58,990
not on at you to to see it coming on

316
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:04,110
had my documents to make sure that this
document

317
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,620
did not disappear and information

318
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,519
would not be lost

319
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:12,879
as and that information will stay
in-house

320
00:19:12,879 --> 00:19:16,429
before believes walls that come from

321
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:20,239
and there's some local love for art

322
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:24,139
so to prevent that and to preclude
search systems

323
00:19:24,139 --> 00:19:29,600
know you so when it to identify those
collisions

324
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,769
because we clear how to build a system

325
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:36,820
the question is who is going to be the
first to put together this

326
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:40,489
system and coming to the computer so so
do peace overtures

327
00:19:40,489 --> 00:19:43,710
is information security document
security

328
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:48,519
is doing its job eighty percent GOP
solutions worker

329
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:52,109
so the cuban from nations site it's a
it's a

330
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:55,440
fights the a accidental

331
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,830
linkages not so good with intentionally
cages

332
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:03,230
not so well because for a number is a
smash in

333
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:07,190
orders for we decided documents by
themselves

334
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:10,720
remotely by themselves those connected
to people who analyzed the

335
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,549
p eople down with much too great a
degree of certainty you can identify

336
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:15,899
their be here

337
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:20,450
and five doser minutes stations much
better intentionally

338
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:25,129
not cannot turn a blind manner and I
think that the market is doing

339
00:20:25,129 --> 00:20:28,539
was going just 2 into this period from
protection

340
00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:32,289
documents to the protection Harper how
committed

341
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:37,450
in-house threats power mother standard
the is the announcer some personnel

342
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:41,059
else's house on the staff the out there

343
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:46,360
company so where the most vulnerable
companies will be closely monitored and

344
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:46,889
stop

345
00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:50,620
that's all I wanted to see how quickly

346
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:54,190
so I feet into my time slot

347
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:57,789
if you have any questions out be happy
to take

348
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,870
your questions will miss

349
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:06,169
I get the best of us the not by the law
school

350
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:09,210
I'm yeah hi work

351
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:12,720
Paso Research Center hallway

352
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,039
in Germany sir

353
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,470
such proposals other important so how to
protect

354
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:26,779
righteously but we're very very serious
loss strict laws to protect personal

355
00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:27,110
data

356
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:31,370
pretty personal data protection and that
not all the general

357
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:35,740
data personal data protection materials
corporate data should be protected so

358
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:38,179
how can how do you it's worth approaches
are

359
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:41,559
this is because this hit it

360
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:46,440
in Germany its it's very bad everything
is because Germany is the first

361
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,750
markets we would like just to go the
wanted to go and the immediately

362
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,809
so we really came up

363
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:56,830
traced to face relations protection of

364
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:00,159
and then please data on his job place

365
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,340
because it was a strange because for
example if your if you want to work

366
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,690
and if you're hired so then you should
work and not just think

367
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:12,299
about the protection excessive measures
of protection of personal data

368
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:16,190
so because if you're at work you need to
work and they're so

369
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,540
and then rushed for the GOP methods

370
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:22,250
that we're trying to introduce an hour
sir so the trade unions are against him

371
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,920
can't do that so the situation is very
bad in Germany

372
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,380
so the paradigm started to change after

373
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:34,120
this last year so once hold on also
spoke about the mass

374
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:39,350
scale espionage a perpetrated by the
United States

375
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:44,310
there so then de Jia a so how should you
possibly not protect the personal data

376
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,520
on employee

377
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,500
remembering in the back of our minds
that it's absolutely Press

378
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,720
transparent as so even our Chancellor he
is on the spot

379
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,370
and so that's right this this this idea
of protecting private lives

380
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:01,420
personalize becomes her ridiculous for

381
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:06,570
and asunder but the German society is
very conservative there was a changing

382
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:07,000
gears

383
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,660
slowly anything I think another 2-3
years

384
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:14,530
passed before the change the senate you
and

385
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:17,650
in 2009 try just axis

386
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:21,630
German market we tried to that for a
couple years

387
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:25,110
but we so we didn't find a single GOP

388
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:28,300
her as a in Germany deal demands

389
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:32,410
or not selling so there's a blocking
ports

390
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,610
and other security matters and paper has
them of

391
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:38,660
as deal P matters but they were not GOP
matters so

392
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:44,970
there was not a single business I'm that
read the OP could be introduced and

393
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:48,800
so done deal the her is not selling so

394
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:53,380
is not selling some now just the start
talk or maybe when it to wash

395
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,950
documents when it to watch closely the
employees so

396
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:02,150
less divided database or incidents and
on a special guy would have a Mac sister

397
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,060
their system

398
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:08,100
so the principal of or eyes
simultaneously with the key

399
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,830
so we're just open up the babies
database and see what's going on

400
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:16,860
so on on it then they can get them
access otherwise this access is denied

401
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:21,170
here second block it if there's a
mistake there and

402
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:26,010
so the and Sunday sauna spa mistakes

403
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:30,700
services artificial intellect first to
second order so there may be some

404
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,150
mistakes but you will have to

405
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:36,160
had to get them access to the database
anyway if we are to do anything about

406
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,720
the

407
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,049
security so theoretically

408
00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:44,690
it's possible to that the software would
meet certain requirements

409
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:48,150
at the same time not to not to

410
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,990
not to violate the rules of primes just

411
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:58,210
personalized certain data protection
personal data protection system and

412
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:01,660
some but we need to understand tetanus

413
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:05,100
when nature improve this for ice
principal

414
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:09,140
than some other things serve them
there's a law on the protection

415
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,910
of her her personal data private lives

416
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:16,360
and Saunders or or law

417
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,380
from the story

418
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:22,350
storing information that mister the
store work ten years there's another

419
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:25,670
and there's a law that the companies are
responsible for

420
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:29,190
for data protection in-house

421
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:33,000
occurs which goes counter because they
cannot install GOP matters

422
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,860
and that's why there's a collision
kirker contrasting

423
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:40,990
interests because the they need to do
that the same time the can up

424
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:46,520
the measures protecting eventually so
we'll make a special version of software

425
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:55,320
jerusalem afterward

426
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,809
and Richard Merkin said that question

427
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:02,590
so that no business wants to control

428
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:06,090
hardcore for channels internet

429
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:10,480
but the same time there's no official
position that any person can come

430
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,559
to work with his own gadget independent
channel access to the base station to

431
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:17,300
Internet to his own much

432
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,820
email sumner tablets was deposit pointer

433
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:24,550
for introducing deal your system because
we can just a man

434
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:28,400
on so catch on to the official channels
but there's always send

435
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,820
another way out because interest because
you can just

436
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:36,240
block on a deficient channels but not
for him it's a certain

437
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,809
certain about says unit/units even just
to to close the the shut the front door

438
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:44,900
so this is important at the same time
understand this vulnerability so then

439
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,870
disperse upon bring your own device

440
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:50,990
at their one is promoting advising and
and advertising

441
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:55,140
Packers then on today I think this is a
disaster

442
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,360
for IT security this is a disaster
because the main

443
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,700
a source of leakage of information his

444
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:05,850
Marshall smart on a small computer can
do anything just like a big computer

445
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:11,200
and Bennett has more

446
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,070
have more opportunities so because it
uses other protocols

447
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:19,030
very difficult to arm to control it so
no

448
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:22,100
in the market there is no solution that
what

449
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,730
protected the information there I MDM
solutions

450
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:29,940
MDM a mobile device management class
that allows you

451
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,990
to control to monitor security but in
fact security setting

452
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:39,280
total do on their mobile devices but
they will not control the content

453
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,470
because it's a very

454
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:45,270
been complicated thing so how do you
arrange it on a computer very simple

455
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:48,650
at the end point and mainly in this is
server part

456
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:52,440
it means that we upload everything does
this server

457
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,940
them analyze all those two cultures so
so a technologist says so they

458
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,690
all keep working and then baby will
provide the verdict

459
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:05,370
tender if you do it on the mobile device
unit 2

460
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:08,429
took to mirror the information you turn
donde Stadium

461
00:28:08,429 --> 00:28:12,540
to wanna wear and the channels are very
difficult very convoluted

462
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:16,679
as on the gym you can't you can make it
as an agent but but but but go to the

463
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:17,400
low-level

464
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:22,429
what do you mean are so unit to support
all the variety and now we have

465
00:28:22,429 --> 00:28:26,730
approximately 4,000 types of mobile
devices with different operator

466
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:30,240
or I almost or or s and them

467
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,500
November including sight mount ok

468
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,549
cannot support all these zoo

469
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:39,610
so probably 6 or 10

470
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:43,340
cell phones would be supported by prime
the quantum point of view

471
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:46,380
you know so I meant ok tried now the
announced

472
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:50,559
but very few do it I mean this
protection

473
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,890
we for a long time we have been thinking
how to address it

474
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:58,590
on one hand we try to take 6m

475
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:01,809
no cell phones so in the fall

476
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:06,480
where going to come up with a solution
but then we decided troll

477
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,230
it's only 60 models so we decided to

478
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:14,490
tomb make our own device and the in the
fall away

479
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:17,549
shell go to the market with it and there

480
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:20,780
you know we shall try to I'm

481
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:25,330
at to market them very her difficult to

482
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:29,120
took to arrange such solution I sir
company

483
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:35,630
well are make a decision that they will
own this selector several versions and

484
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:39,789
near I will not allow so bring your own
phone

485
00:29:39,789 --> 00:29:45,330
over different type riser we distribute
six types of say a cell phones or we try

486
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:49,100
to support those who but we know that we
shall have from

487
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,970
piano cribbing points so there is

488
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:56,830
no no but nice and working workable
solution

489
00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:00,320
no so

490
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:09,300
on your right on your right

491
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,460
and so

492
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,650
I want to talk about those internal you
know behaviour

493
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:17,850
breaches and I'll to analyze them I'm in
a bank

494
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:23,350
actually we see more and more solutions
in the market but they have

495
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:29,280
very you know a a different %uh so highs
are you can watch show

496
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,030
what the behavior on the working station
or attempts to

497
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:37,179
up in a treat as ADB's or

498
00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:40,580
try to find links and the social
networker

499
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:45,940
to find out if your employees is so
connected to some

500
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:49,529
criminal gangs same whatever I mean no

501
00:30:49,529 --> 00:30:53,610
to to who will buy the quantum or
competitors says so

502
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:59,620
but there are no centralized solution
that would collect everything

503
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:03,970
into a console you're working on it
right but the most interesting question

504
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:04,730
is when

505
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:08,230
you're going to make it and how much

506
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:11,340
is going to cost because your costs are
very high

507
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,409
will the small companies afford it

508
00:31:14,409 --> 00:31:17,320
if on

509
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:21,090
its affordable for big companies sold a
step-by-step

510
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:26,259
it will become affordable for so so far
there's a trick there's a catch

511
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:29,289
one thing is set to present

512
00:31:29,289 --> 00:31:33,149
my sweet butter and another is to
develop such a solution

513
00:31:33,149 --> 00:31:37,259
I'm not sure it's a absolutely possible
for us first

514
00:31:37,259 --> 00:31:42,210
my even we have this cross-section

515
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:46,080
between technologists we shall have
connections or conclusions so that will

516
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,789
give you false results

517
00:31:47,789 --> 00:31:53,509
and to and it's hardly possible so why

518
00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:58,899
is a solution still not exist because no
one tried to combined we tried

519
00:31:58,899 --> 00:32:02,049
to combine some graphical connections

520
00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:05,379
or technologies that allow to

521
00:32:05,379 --> 00:32:09,349
and to to oppress us trace negative for

522
00:32:09,349 --> 00:32:13,529
and feedback in social networks so we
understand how to

523
00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:17,070
look for negative for YUM

524
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:20,369
or feedback about that there is a kitsch
in

525
00:32:20,369 --> 00:32:23,559
the user ID you can now link it to a GOP
but

526
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:26,809
am we are not sure

527
00:32:26,809 --> 00:32:30,970
if this system can be develop at all

528
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:34,529
and I cannot tell you about the price

529
00:32:34,529 --> 00:32:38,149
so I guess we shall come up with a new

530
00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:42,309
version on the better version of this
system next fall but

531
00:32:42,309 --> 00:32:45,909
you know speaking about the prices I can
tell you

532
00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:51,309
as a rule the solution is so going to be
very expensive in the beginning but as

533
00:32:51,309 --> 00:32:53,559
you scale if the price will go down

534
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:56,759
if it works we

535
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:59,950
a shall be able to reduce the price but

536
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:02,950
as a question-answer if the

537
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:08,270
solution will be efficient enough if
it's

538
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:14,480
possible to create it at all

539
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,490
can you please tell me a view lamb to

540
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:22,390
distribute this solution no

541
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:25,640
anti-virus s and cryptographic for

542
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:30,460
protection mincer are quite popular and
one you start to

543
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:34,490
to deploy use them there is that never a
question why

544
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:37,500
but speaking about deal PC

545
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,929
and a IPS and other

546
00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:46,260
systems so people always ask why do we
need it because it's not going to give

547
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,220
us anything

548
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:51,100
it will only make our work harder

549
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:57,799
so from we have been promoting deal P
since 2007

550
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:03,110
we have a department and now on analytic
Department collecting Philly

551
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:07,510
exe reports on things like that we have
serious about it we

552
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:13,149
made a conference we publish books we
have a poor though about internal leaks

553
00:34:13,149 --> 00:34:17,030
so everything you know within our power

554
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:21,450
we're trying to but do P has a serious
issue when I was showing my approach

555
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:21,899
should

556
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:25,550
free deal p.m. GOP and things like that
unfortunately

557
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:28,730
the company expect that deal be is

558
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:33,649
software like anti-virus so you just
come and install it

559
00:34:33,649 --> 00:34:37,629
and eat will show you also mix and
sometimes one

560
00:34:37,629 --> 00:34:42,379
people install it devoid and it catches
nothing

561
00:34:42,379 --> 00:34:47,070
so companies get disappointed but this
so

562
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:51,609
thing does not work automatico it first
you need to understand what you're going

563
00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:52,310
to catch

564
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:58,050
so why small companies to have very
little acceptance of deal P because

565
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:02,540
it they don't know how come to arrange
cheap consulting

566
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:06,470
consulting is always expensive they need
to

567
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:10,480
come they need to set it up but you can
more per

568
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,500
you know charge one dollar for it so it
means that

569
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,869
200,000 rubles a solution for a small
company

570
00:35:17,869 --> 00:35:19,940
is either FAA all

571
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:25,750
or so with the Hampton Bays principles
so what we do we just

572
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:30,660
a make solution for banks for utilities

573
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,869
for sector 17 verticals currently

574
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:37,020
each vertical install so

575
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:40,940
the vertical to you but each company's
individual ATM

576
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:44,920
is a risk is that we're going to KH
something wrong

577
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:50,410
not what the company requires so fine
tuning for the company is necessary

578
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:54,250
in this respect deal p is

579
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:57,819
kind of tricky software because you need
to educate explain

580
00:35:57,819 --> 00:36:01,460
fine-tune setup people have to

581
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:04,640
to to sweat over it that's why

582
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,650
base negative for impression look deal P

583
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:13,160
technologies only ten-years-old and anti
virus is 25

584
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:18,210
it's more mature so I guess so within
the next 15 years so we

585
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:21,260
shadow learn

586
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:31,359
they're probably remove this negative
perception

587
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:36,690
would like to request to you to approach
companies in a more aggressive manner

588
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:42,320
one day you visit us your
representatives came and then No

589
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,840
they just brought some brochures and
that's it

590
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,040
because how

591
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,740
else can we explain then prevailed a
poor upon our

592
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:56,580
management so after the conference a
approach me

593
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,820
we shall discuss how to become more
aggressive

594
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:03,240
to help you

595
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:11,670
hun with you in their company

596
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:15,279
so my name is further so

597
00:37:15,279 --> 00:37:18,579
speaking about %uh promoting GOP
solution set

598
00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:22,039
Ennis is software that this rather
positioned

599
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:26,229
as a.m. security want but what about

600
00:37:26,229 --> 00:37:31,499
with the state companies we're

601
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:35,259
probably legislation

602
00:37:35,259 --> 00:37:40,880
is a higher a motivating factor or
certifications

603
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,660
do have any Moussa in the

604
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,709
this respect local we have

605
00:37:47,709 --> 00:37:52,150
for even Apperson in there analytics
Department

606
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:56,130
that to I studies legislation

607
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:59,289
in that country's probably ten countries
so where we

608
00:37:59,289 --> 00:38:03,339
are present and own play information
security innovations

609
00:38:03,339 --> 00:38:06,859
that can apply to the company

610
00:38:06,859 --> 00:38:11,449
we track will monitor for instance so
look at the law on personal data

611
00:38:11,449 --> 00:38:15,160
immediately we change our software to
comply

612
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:19,819
to for instance a a second across or

613
00:38:19,819 --> 00:38:22,829
another law on

614
00:38:22,829 --> 00:38:27,479
something we made it late right to
introduce

615
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:30,650
the relevant changes butter

616
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:35,189
we are a software vendor and we provide
this software

617
00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:38,739
but not a complete solution we are not
an integrator

618
00:38:38,739 --> 00:38:43,380
and if you need to a turnkey solution
that would the

619
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,679
be completely compliant it's not

620
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:50,769
to us we have partners we work with all

621
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:54,449
the largest integrators and there are
people who do it best

622
00:38:54,449 --> 00:38:57,699
that a few need

623
00:38:57,699 --> 00:39:01,969
to change something in the software then
your turn to us

624
00:39:01,969 --> 00:39:05,109
but it's a very infrequent case

625
