1
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:04,880
simulated

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,240
yes a special boards issue

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,490
budget hi today I'll talk about it

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,769
protecting a mobile phone from my and be

5
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:19,660
capturing GSM signal used

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,300
let's start on this thunders that's that
my phone users

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,820
what is just some fun to three
generations

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,419
2g3 3G and 4G now whatever I'll be
talking about a little concerned

9
00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:36,500
2g only why are we so interested in 2g

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,010
old 2g was put into operation

11
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,090
and not her design late in nineteen
eighties send

12
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,969
put into operation early nineteen
nineties now its most popular with the

13
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:48,899
widest

14
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,230
covered chin who

15
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,500
it is more than twenty-years-old
soldiers

16
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,460
it doesn't have some safety security
problems like a one-sided authentication

17
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,050
and a

18
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,460
unscripted connection possibility

19
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:11,290
let's see how it works tells we have the
phone and know how the base station

20
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,580
on the simcha and SIM card you out the

21
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,509
E key right deal which is not

22
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,049
extractable and which is used for up
identification

23
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:27,140
on the operator scientist at triplet is
generated

24
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:32,509
can a random number and they key for
encryption key the base station

25
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:36,530
game will transom ain't this surrender
number to the phone

26
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,079
which then centers to the same kind

27
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,090
which she returns to values

28
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:47,259
me and

29
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:49,439
good miss res

30
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,600
and osha and operate a check sent to

31
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,219
identify the a subscriber then to

32
00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:00,840
sends our team command for star

33
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,979
sons encryption went to NC its is using

34
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:11,730
the Casey p and as you can see from this
seller through

35
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:16,599
should there's nothing that prevents the
into love from my substituting the base

36
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,370
station

37
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,579
and bypass then

38
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:24,640
encryption who have fight

39
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,319
fire line I've 52 is not used I 53 is
more

40
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:32,489
reliable but I 51

41
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:37,079
can be crack share in the second to
using

42
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:40,549
professional decryption devices so what

43
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:46,510
be not into that can do not need to use
in the in using this song ability

44
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:51,239
first along the weekend here what we did

45
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,780
say over the phone no in an autotune

46
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,889
the do the interception will have and
three blocks lever tell

47
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:03,299
virtual base station my deion

48
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:08,310
recruiter and as a emulator so the
telephone is connected to the vertell's

49
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,840
virtual station the

50
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,819
emulator only mobile phone what it does
is

51
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:20,010
is connecting the telephone to the

52
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,480
operator for this purpose

53
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,459
the encryption code months the cramped
with AKC

54
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:30,900
which dust the session

55
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,299
encryption all this interceptor as a

56
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:38,090
full-scale system is quite expensive but
there is a simpler

57
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,480
version which looks like this

58
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,070
it has the and controversial station

59
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,900
and to it uses internet connection to
proxies

60
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,270
be to call Lisa option has some
limitations

61
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:57,060
said it's a case on work once I and
connection

62
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,110
from recently signed be

63
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:05,970
Michael olympian the subscriber can I
make a call

64
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,050
only in the second option using this sir

65
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,140
used reliability the

66
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,350
there's an I am sis sigh catcher and the
signal

67
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,489
locker I am s I catcher

68
00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:25,470
blocks signals and that turns them back
so

69
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,410
the subscriber goes back to the
operators

70
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,460
real network but we already have the
identifies

71
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,520
second option is a block and the signal
the blocker

72
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,010
ya it works the same as a and IMS

73
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,840
a culture but after authentication it

74
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,720
acceptance the subscriber that

75
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,270
sits in the a with virtual

76
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,330
station and no servers says are
available

77
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:58,340
how can we not find such a virtual base
stations

78
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:02,030
there are some signs okay we can

79
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,530
lookin to the network and

80
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:10,370
they will be seen and there's also a
vindication elders in which is more

81
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,470
complex sold

82
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:18,010
there are some special features what
they describe so fires a simplified

83
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,350
model so system always

84
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,740
look and the or a signal

85
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,539
cool

86
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:27,940
means its to switch the subscriber

87
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,710
to another us no

88
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,919
to the virtual one must be more

89
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:38,229
over more and there is a PC

90
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:43,110
to call fish into a cheese used by the
operator so

91
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,699
and this here for example if you I'll

92
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:50,340
enter the metro station no the

93
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,569
indeed meh rush hour

94
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:58,830
load will be here high and the the
signal must be more powerful sold a

95
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,650
virtual station does the same

96
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:04,490
and area wraps the your subscribers

97
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,639
to itself yearly

98
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:12,580
no operator's an odd this traffic and
there will be special requests

99
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:17,669
interest more responsible for enquiring

100
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,850
re: requesting the jack connection
channel

101
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:24,250
younger may also

102
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,000
other special features like a no

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,050
like a location area cold to black

104
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:35,229
a absence of some service like a edge

105
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:38,520
for example requires a different type of
modulation so

106
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,960
to implement its will be more costly
Hinata to

107
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,940
first switch over instead of using
coefficients work and

108
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:53,810
just to turned down and the

109
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:57,169
notes on the real

110
00:06:57,169 --> 00:07:01,220
operator tones another

111
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,300
and specialty show the protocol is
absence all the neighbors so

112
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,240
all the features smart with the the
white

113
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,449
collar highlighted in right is something
that you can

114
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:15,880
a you receive via

115
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,289
massively without cinder connecting with
the network

116
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:23,419
but also other it

117
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:26,659
signs that we can now look for I'd

118
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:30,240
absence of encryption and opening up
channel without

119
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,779
transactions

120
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:36,899
so how can we use these criteria to

121
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:40,599
trying to find it

122
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:44,050
near I'm aware sir first time had to
learn how to use the

123
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,830
as thier I S T R missus of software that

124
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:51,909
Cana I turned tuned to anna &

125
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:55,360
the thank us that we need and and

126
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,739
distant echo the signal and use it on a
computer

127
00:07:58,739 --> 00:08:01,789
another option is use B&B

128
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:04,949
processors here I

129
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:09,259
show them most important most popular
suppliers

130
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:13,269
if we use as dr. what is the outcome

131
00:08:13,269 --> 00:08:16,489
the outcome will be yes

132
00:08:16,489 --> 00:08:20,129
spectrum and broadband channel

133
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:23,989
yes Dr can not yes

134
00:08:23,989 --> 00:08:28,719
communicate with the base station old

135
00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:32,659
box there's another strong point with
STR because we can

136
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:38,000
view the spectrum GSM standard

137
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,659
over some other emitters of the radio
signal that must be

138
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:44,709
and management for

139
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:48,360
match a magnetic compatibility not all
her shell

140
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,259
stations inputs comply with its GSM
standard

141
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:56,180
in times like these criteria so we can
also use this tool

142
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:02,690
a local for the and now signs

143
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,090
sold another teacher is the possibility
to parse

144
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:10,350
the and communication flaunt the
broadband channel

145
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,410
soul this is so kind of a mess is that
we'll see

146
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:17,140
down there Hills you see

147
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,160
a an open the message on

148
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,250
broadband that tells us about the
criteria of

149
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,000
for switching to the cell and

150
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,920
identifiers if we use a call calm

151
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,930
the bed and then if it is to be able to
open the allocated

152
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:41,440
lotta channel and the connected to the
cell and you can also

153
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,090
have more no information to communicate

154
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:50,900
with cocom this software on was

155
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:55,880
implement its based on joint which opens
the interface of

156
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,950
Qualcomm based on the message bus
received

157
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:04,970
tool him see whether the base station is
legitimate

158
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:09,380
the one that it is connected to mmm

159
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:13,040
the which communicates with the mobile
device

160
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,920
as we analyze these features we

161
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,650
added now waits to with each other and
as soon as the wait

162
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:26,250
to reach a certain point weekend seee
decide whether it's a virtual or real

163
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,350
station and also as the channel

164
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,600
opens we look at the HS

165
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,720
encryption and some other parameters so
this is already an area of active

166
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,530
testing

167
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:41,390
but this is that where we are really
very much limited wifi

168
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:46,320
Qualcomm diagnostic protocol which is
not documented

169
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,930
there are some programs programs like go
kart

170
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:53,130
which parses Qualcomm long locks

171
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:56,480
but to there's no official documentation
is all

172
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,960
unavailable close so no

173
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,120
we used to date are otherwise wellness

174
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:16,869
all more or less thank you

175
00:11:16,869 --> 00:11:18,170
said

176
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:22,769
I can take questions if any think there
is a microphone ng

177
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:26,230
in the room good

178
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:30,399
the next generation room

179
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,499
to give more protection right to do
whatever is said

180
00:11:33,499 --> 00:11:37,249
now as the only abouts unit

181
00:11:37,249 --> 00:11:40,649
to gene the later generations

182
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:44,910
use the to sidle authentication no

183
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,299
use not so easy anymore to intercepts

184
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:53,220
it'll take some %ah cracking on the
inscription corruption

185
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,730
or in there is a possibility downgrading
so they will

186
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:02,540
force it to drop down to this: a2g to
write

187
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,119
nobody yes but to we are not saying
you're talking about

188
00:12:06,119 --> 00:12:14,050
and nothing in with 3G is set in

189
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,170
machine catcher attack so we can I get
to me

190
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:21,100
identify Raven without authorization
another question

191
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,490
them

192
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:31,220
what about the morn a modern your
amputation system

193
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,360
is if you have a McGruder suspect on

194
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,440
table and interceptor maybe there's so
little be enough for the Packer

195
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,560
to get the data and the be undetected

196
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,410
want to what data domain all the traffic
back to India

197
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:51,370
month phone telephone and then GSM I

198
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:55,500
base station or sell he s city that may
be enough but

199
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,680
first to his what you think it is a bout
combination

200
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,850
powers is 24 life i won

201
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:09,250
encryption algorithm but you know and
understand their

202
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,490
operator I uses a

203
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,959
long balancing and the subscriber will
be

204
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:19,320
moved between the stations so you need
to have

205
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,500
for the hoping map which

206
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,709
is the not included 24 SMS but

207
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:30,029
the does is included for no

208
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:33,100
arms Voice communication so when it's

209
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,700
to somehow capture their otherwise we
need to

210
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,779
you have a my broadband channel two

211
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:44,180
get all the net jeers mom

212
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,560
GGSN traffic this is more expensive
because this

213
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,670
the takes a broader band connection

214
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:54,750
use it is it possible for anyone

215
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,649
to control via connection parameters

216
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:02,399
with their limited well possibility
depends on the

217
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,500
band or for example the Qualcomm

218
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,660
option as long as you for some standards

219
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,899
to a force the and any connection to the
base station

220
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:16,399
other SIM card would also included can

221
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,880
saying have Ellis told or blacklist

222
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,589
alva I'll in cells

223
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:27,550
which are not allowed so we can the
unions and possibly can

224
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:32,260
do some went on but to their limited

225
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,740
and say catcher missing a also known as
urs

226
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:41,179
whose Jim Gray San knit group

227
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:44,339
years and gonna encryption yes

228
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:49,350
well a.m. on a quite a lot of software

229
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,980
products or including for Android what
was the motivation to

230
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,429
you do your own to maker on what is how
is in better from others

231
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:01,569
you know when we started all that is the
it was the only one on the market and

232
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:02,209
eight

233
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:05,720
didn't really work one and

234
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,049
December the Asus nopes need ship
presentation

235
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:12,359
I since December

236
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:16,980
I think they made some more development
and they didn't have fun

237
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:22,850
the AM model

238
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,889
no wrong right flanks but

239
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:29,649
the me their house some weaknesses as
well so

240
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:34,119
the motivation is there to do work on
our part

241
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:39,649
noon they're saying that the to win a
lot of time to collect statistics

242
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:43,069
how they have GSM project as the college

243
00:15:43,069 --> 00:15:46,899
and Ba'al

244
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:50,569
do they say they want to reduce the
number of our

245
00:15:50,569 --> 00:15:54,129
now or or false and false SAR

246
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:58,529
tribes canister discs for our country

247
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:01,959
know it's too early and it's still under
testing

248
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:08,660
and the seeks approval

249
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:12,780
is it possible to avoid rear

250
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,450
mmm American action frohnmayer

251
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:20,090
ga-ga sent to 2g yes it is possible to

252
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:23,230
preclude this so is it the

253
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:27,110
telephone level softer and yes sir

254
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,240
Mikan not

255
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,760
disallow a standard that you don't like
a

256
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:40,200
at t-mobile device adult

257
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:47,020
think there is one more question over
them

258
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,470
home the

259
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,470
is talking about welcome you also
mentioned

260
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:57,180
m2k how is it different

261
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:02,450
for MTK knows all those so highway in
some some platforms

262
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,770
I'm basebands

263
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:10,070
over the company says it easier to work
with them another question

264
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:14,140
I do you have any plans to would to the
Android software

265
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:18,579
into play marketed about to call common
Meditech

266
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,579
the difference is that a

267
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:27,150
and the case was of rockwell calm the
documentation is more closed

268
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,670
market wise Qualcomm as 'em

269
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:34,270
more about top models while many attack

270
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:37,450
he is used a lot in cheap

271
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:41,840
columns like a chinese-made and it's
easy to

272
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,700
Changi name email Qualcomm

273
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:50,200
does not allow that so easily and also
the difference is that

274
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,570
as we use diagnostic interfaces
performance

275
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:58,250
over message is a different to do
implementation on Meditech will require

276
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,710
doing it from scratch

277
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:05,140
we do have algorithms but to me the
implementation will be their different

278
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,380
told her to the second question about
the Android Market

279
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:12,040
new licensing arrangements

280
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,460
is not yet cleared maybe an open source
project or

281
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:22,869
commercial wireless still undecided
