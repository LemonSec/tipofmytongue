1
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,500
so I can begin hello

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,070
everyone to date me

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:15,180
I would like to tell you about such a
thing

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,650
that economical people and

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,220
accountants don't even know about its
cool 200 open source projects after

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,340
so I we have conducted big number one
source projects we have completed

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,560
certain knowledge

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,750
on the basis of this and we have noted
love interest to think that would like

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,640
to share with you

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,920
defect is that economical people
financial Ser they don't even understand

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,790
how

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,750
bad the situation is Dr living inside
sure

13
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,600
Eagles world they want to take their
head in the say well no evidence go with

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,950
people think that

15
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,590
SP about security said they would like
to think that everything is normal

16
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,020
and they have not yet but it's very
interesting if you will take up the

17
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,360
statistical analysis methodology it's a
wonderful things that you can see

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,170
and a Co remind want only about

19
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,829
I love this I'm and a copy of and one of
the developers are the statistical

20
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:04,469
analyzer

21
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:08,529
the studio maybe you've heard about it
and why I love the way Acer

22
00:01:08,529 --> 00:01:12,340
of the much of this product which a big
number open source projects big

23
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,229
also closed projects but I'm speaking
about open source project because we can

24
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:16,939
speak about them

25
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:21,179
we don't have any signed so we have
tested on more than two hundred twelve

26
00:01:21,179 --> 00:01:21,579
for

27
00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:27,289
on projects and I want them big known so

28
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:30,810
we have a big decision about what can be
called

29
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,109
i think is gonna be interesting for you:
in more detail you will be able to go to

30
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:36,349
our internet site and

31
00:01:36,349 --> 00:01:39,509
learn about to say error see you believe
it articles about it but it's

32
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:42,859
afterwards well right now other to tell
you

33
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:47,310
barred 7 interesting observations that
we have detected about

34
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,880
how people program the seven scenes of
programmers is going to be interesting

35
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,950
from the point of view security and
training

36
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,200
and the you learn something new
otherwise

37
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,520
I could call it seven scenes of
programmers let's begin with a simple

38
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:00,969
one

39
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:04,719
programmers sometimes are confident

40
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,119
that compiler is at fault if something
is unclear

41
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:11,599
they say well it's a problem compiler

42
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,340
compiler is at fault why DIII phased out
because the fact is

43
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,470
well citing the

44
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,760
aris in projects its left on that next
to this

45
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,620
errors I can see certain gonna switch
tell me do you know

46
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,640
these it cold I made a page here all
these

47
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,710
button you know it's a problem with the
compiler

48
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:34,400
the simple that's how it looks slight
men said with clean it

49
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,670
would like to clear some the structure
but we meeting with site itself

50
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,360
up these the first bites are cleaned and
everybody else anything else about what

51
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,100
the human dose

52
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:49,260
the human is on haiti he says days
doesn't seem to help of the optimization

53
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,940
into default version its 0 spot in the
release version

54
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:57,709
compiler is a having problems so he says
it manually he feels

55
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:01,570
all the fields with zero so he won the
zero

56
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,300
than he felt so the program lasts she
was 58

57
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,130
fighting against the compiler and his
company that it's not him at fault by

58
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:09,840
the compiler

59
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,360
it's a similar observation that I've
noticed and i've seen many things like

60
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:15,650
that

61
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,740
next one does another observation

62
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:23,200
sometimes you can see some historical
yes which were heading to the QLogic

63
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,250
prism deals as well living and then make
a right died and then that is awesome

64
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:27,730
tied up

65
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,610
so some people are projects also was
doing something from several you can see

66
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:35,100
was only you have moved from a chart to
teach our right

67
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,250
sure why cells or from Morlock to you

68
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,500
you can transfer or from 32 to 64 bits
and I will give a couple settles

69
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,630
following all the Mitchell right you
move to teach our

70
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,160
your change all the world's year change
it but then you forgot that you've been

71
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,080
working with those

72
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,540
and of maloca gives the quantity

73
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:58,370
well in the beginning the number she was
what normal but then you have two times

74
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:58,880
less

75
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:03,980
bosra at and Sun well it still works but
only if the allies are short evidence

76
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,709
possible but if you get there long

77
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:10,030
Alliance outside of the ray and you see
that this is our

78
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:14,200
well in certification a lot a lot of
mistakes like that him next add me to

79
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,110
write files

80
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:19,549
somebody has decided that this much
better for him to go to the you

81
00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:23,370
operate new it said apollo but he
forgets that new

82
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,200
the is not returning pots bought a

83
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,760
it looks at the exception that some

84
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,680
was wrong but processors work old as
they were with that model previously

85
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,020
10 long as you're easy road and you
should bring something

86
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,030
you leave its new closures he overplay
said

87
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:45,550
the you looked at UMass my lowkey have
replaced by new

88
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,570
well application works check speaking
until something was wrong

89
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,810
next one a big leah is a transition from
32 to 64

90
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,320
problem generally what you have written
is it as evidence in normal

91
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,840
but then some magic begins for example
the function receives the work Jr

92
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,150
Shelby type showed it last for bugging
in in case a it says

93
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:11,000
do you work obligations in Kasson dan

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,450
other was a do what has been requested
energy what is shelves

95
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,770
well the problem watch for so yes
savings one about

96
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,740
god forbid I remember object will be
created outside

97
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,340
first the gigabytes of memory

98
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,790
then you cut the second part and you
receive uncertain behavior

99
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,670
these problems they make assumption that
they want but

100
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:37,810
it on the Sims it worked the less
observational

101
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,430
is the effective the last night I think
you can get

102
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:46,400
a Michael Klein bus the fall other
shoreline lol

103
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,340
meters of listen let me know they're
tired but did calls

104
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,410
they just don't have a real ass they are
these all in bed

105
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:56,790
let Dad joyful and the last attention
and then date

106
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,860
job same people with financial people
when the look up the pacing

107
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,660
they're very careful while online was
copper base it's a one-stop base it

108
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,190
relies was kept at bay said

109
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:10,680
but in the last Monday much it and it's
a such mass character

110
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,950
occasion I read about this in the
article he is in the air in the last

111
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,860
lead at least eight ish the last line

112
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,210
an idiot i figured out it's a big bass
project and

113
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:22,510
different projects you can see something
like that ages the

114
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:26,950
Salada X Y is at sad of a channel should
be Donald R

115
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:31,980
in this case ending one light was carpet
basin but they forgot to amend it cutesy

116
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:36,340
same thing where you should check for
Gables XY

117
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:41,430
W but Asia forgot so big number

118
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,639
and I get so interested in it I was a
chance to TCF collected distances

119
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,789
about fifteen hundred examples when he
hits it typical blogs

120
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:52,139
i've calculated and a few doubt that at
Heathrow

121
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:55,250
we have 5 similar properties were done a

122
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,770
there's a high probability that the last
air line

123
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,370
there will be staying they may commit
mistaken copy ps2

124
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:06,240
copycat batista a modified but on a fine
line

125
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,199
on a final bid price to they have four
times more errors than previous ones

126
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,220
then let's go to the observation that
before programmer stay Inc

127
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,620
the day are smartest well it's not a
question its true

128
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,349
they are often know a lot of things
because

129
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:29,539
if the user comes to them and ask them
who was doing what and what and

130
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:31,270
something happen by itself

131
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:35,800
but they know that well nothing happens
by itself daylight to get to the core

132
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,710
the problem they always think that they
are right

133
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,050
and they get used to being always right
but there's an exciting it

134
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:48,009
EF programmers are wrong it's very
difficult to convince him that his role

135
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:51,979
especially it is difficult had to Dubai
some sort but

136
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:55,610
instrument for example if some
programmer says that well

137
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,500
you have got care here he said no it's
not a matter

138
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,150
never never never never it's a battle
ensure

139
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,169
ma situations a big problem for example
will be checking

140
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:10,530
I love this non woven Stein 3d project
civil

141
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:14,719
air potential problem at the

142
00:08:14,719 --> 00:08:18,110
metres has to be Cup victory by three
but the air is here

143
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:21,940
that the serb points are size of from
pointer which was the point are

144
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:27,039
so it's not and here about a quarter was
a specified

145
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,560
saw three people was

146
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,770
writing some people left comments
somebody been ready your

147
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,820
analyzers rolled in the article I have
explained am

148
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,940
why the season there look here is the
latest example

149
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,240
addition or you're on your own even if
they don't believe in the article

150
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,490
do you see it

151
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,560
how low is probability that a person
will be given liza

152
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,550
but she will say that in the cell
function as their he wanted analyzer

153
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,480
she'll say no it's the wrong analyzer

154
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,220
Evans wonderful your see an example here

155
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,470
I love the male discussion there's a
certain

156
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,670
a rainy of charge

157
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:11,779
and it wasn't extra naming

158
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:14,970
size of charge from one char

159
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:18,230
he's brought 20 the everyone's stay as
they were before

160
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,750
memes and personalized it's a false
statement

161
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,990
India slide as many bites as in a
festive day

162
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:31,180
array well it's painful to tell me but
it's very difficult

163
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:35,270
so I have to thrown to the people that
they made mistakes

164
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:38,540
much sometimes it scares you going to
show up with it all so

165
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:43,070
know if for all DC that its former
compiler analyzer

166
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:47,820
read it carefully it's a common mistake
number five security security well its

167
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,250
q2 related conference security issues
about contests

168
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:56,029
the security it's a rhetorical question
but fact is that nobody

169
00:09:56,029 --> 00:10:00,190
Empire checks all different mechanisms
they're called which

170
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:03,820
have to defend something or keen
something et cetera

171
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,050
and the simplest example here those in
array

172
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,370
a what we increase in it getting
something

173
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,740
well x64 by detection well the scene
your

174
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,820
like in the previous example if you're
not a problem

175
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,709
I put date for the start here in vain
downside

176
00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:25,339
says HR one bite his field everything
else

177
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:28,920
as was it is certain private data stays
in memory

178
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,200
balls happen there past from every it's
even worse with a function

179
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,100
mom said the fact is that for fathers
today they are very clever and smart and

180
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,670
Dale of to optimize well it's wonderful
had because they work a fast but

181
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:46,270
for example compilers remote functions
which one the point of view of the

182
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:46,750
compiler

183
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,660
unnecessary what the it means the
function is no need to bother

184
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:54,500
knows how to mend said function works
that's right

185
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,180
EF some offer is being cleaned but day

186
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,820
it's not used in any other function the
compiler from the point if you're sick

187
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,770
last bus languish

188
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:07,630
have dismiss it does nothing right from
the purview of the language you this

189
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,720
message will be removed

190
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,860
nothing will happen but from the point
of people there is sense

191
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,950
we have a certain private data ball for
and we have to clean it

192
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:19,530
with zeros before leading by the
compiler agree with this man said

193
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:27,060
and this happened so often its of
awareness coming in many projects

194
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,810
for sale in PHP

195
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,870
in the air down to it was a for Sunday
have cleaned

196
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:38,070
said in offered to have left and this
lie disappears

197
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:41,360
after the completion of the release
version

198
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,010
and even here you see that this man said
is not applicable have come back by then

199
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:49,790
but the message is not available in the
next a spare

200
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:53,750
happened to we have checked the kernel
minutes after we have informed them they

201
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,920
have replacement said

202
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,920
by special a mess explicit which really
cleans

203
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,490
and the %uh special functions for that

204
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,500
innocence this session exhale secures is
a

205
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,420
memoli in either once it's another one
but the hope role is that

206
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,610
all these projects are after which
should always trust we're not gonna

207
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:16,970
we have fun 160 thats errors ladies a
complete

208
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:21,750
169 errors where the blame for our has
to be cleaned but obviously it's not

209
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,280
clean

210
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:27,040
so some data is still hating the memory
and then some against him

211
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,350
when the bindle we've been looking for
other air some obvious ones

212
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,750
but you wanna 569 were discovered

213
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,440
and I've been reading some that have
been session for

214
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,510
next one well it's not the same but
nevertheless

215
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,490
it's impossible to know everything red
everybody knows that

216
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:50,880
but evil that's right reliable and safe
software we have to learn learn learn

217
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,520
learn

218
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,880
laws options and statistical analyzers
can help you from this point to you

219
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,630
because they

220
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:01,020
play a role in a certain expect which
has a such no late share

221
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,700
which program a campaign issue that he
has such a there is an equal but the

222
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,560
analysis can know about that the

223
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,690
potential defects software the program
and there

224
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,930
internal walks in article they say step
cart is an air

225
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:17,740
kabc in function don't use it you have
his str8

226
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,560
and Kat and people use but usually they
use its rent because nobody read it

227
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,370
carefully

228
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:27,180
issue touch because it says that the
final parameter defies not the size of

229
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:27,890
this bull for

230
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:32,230
to which you copy but how many more can
be copied to it so

231
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:37,430
a.m. in my ass icy cold Amy's dating
that has specified by the Los

232
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:41,070
are going to sizes ball for know it says
that we still have to tell

233
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,760
some forty eight emails and we have two
thousand forty teams here and then we

234
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,850
have called like the subtle so basically
speaking

235
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,860
you can write like it previously and
there will be different

236
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,920
as it was if dangerous it's a dangerous

237
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,510
well so people know about that day right
size of minus

238
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:00,960
a control and fun but it's close its
almost good but steel

239
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:06,720
it still -1 nobody comes to the fore
expression to the full proper station

240
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,460
another interesting example

241
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:15,580
char is not cool so if something more
somewhere it doesn't work as it should

242
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,800
work usually

243
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,560
let's see this is a synthetic urine
sample that was riding in order to be

244
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:20,990
brave

245
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:24,690
was a map cm be. some compared with
something then

246
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:30,520
it returns not completed arch but char
and this is actually being at sea and

247
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:30,860
the

248
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,430
you can to follow the your rail it was
in my skill

249
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:39,240
Park care we have no diagnostic but at
that moment I'm

250
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,020
we have started our analyzer and will we
could find it them but as many geo

251
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,660
this air there's no guarantee that
missus bush or minus

252
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:52,270
all this year or what its roots returns
less than zero or more than 80

253
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:55,580
more than zero this could be 256 for
example

254
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:00,030
when you put you on the fetus seeks he
will put in check

255
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:03,120
it will be 0 so it means that they are
equaled

256
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,590
so sexual positions do happen and the

257
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:10,020
therefore people don't know about it but
it's available

258
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,740
observation that was seven

259
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:18,430
in search of silver bullet you know some
people look for some reason

260
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,260
for silver bullets

261
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:26,190
you should look for the silver bullet
that different ways and approaches and

262
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,310
we need them

263
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:31,210
for some there's a close overview
development

264
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:34,840
true test seeing dynamic analyze
historical

265
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,300
elisa's there's no single method which
could replace or other methods

266
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:43,060
well in principle we can say that called
over if you can replace all other

267
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,660
methods

268
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,950
but it's not practical

269
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:50,630
in real life so

270
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:54,240
read all the critical stretch you so
each one of these methods is vulnerable

271
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,460
and you should use all

272
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,920
so what date do AC in tests in unit s

273
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,120
in tests and studying on Leiser
discovers very often

274
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,720
errors in chess for sample

275
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,820
love you write it for the chess so
something crazy Alexander

276
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,230
here's another example

277
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:17,290
fragment from the space you yes

278
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:20,510
for some wear certain logic will have
tests

279
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:23,800
for sony has included will do it but
afterwards

280
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,160
the person wanted to comment something
she doesn't

281
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,450
doesn't need is actions he commended the
but budget heaven

282
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,570
right now this EF these EF

283
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:38,040
it's difficult this if because it's
really here and the test

284
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,650
will not be launched it will be started
only this condition will be executed

285
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:46,570
so there is no test action when a test
basically week committing this test

286
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:49,870
as for the

287
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:54,200
called overview eight slag Asia

288
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:59,230
after mall a gata below in the UC they
look small small small unless all you

289
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,010
don't see

290
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:03,310
such first five minutes you attention
tenants your

291
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:07,380
honest 15 minutes you wanna have coffee
hasn't won since you have to finish

292
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,550
otherwise it's not going to make any
sense so it's in

293
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:14,589
possible for human being to do that to
offer you the court or it's too

294
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:15,530
expensive

295
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:19,589
you have to I ask people to work with no
brakes

296
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:23,400
cetera et cetera that development will
be ten times more expensive

297
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,490
as still love fact that people will
listen attention so when you look at

298
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,140
something like that

299
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,850
often sell

300
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,390
we are in a bit an example in a small
example

301
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,520
where many itself ALC receive and the

302
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,620
I it doesn't see any errors the ice
don't want to perceive this call BBC

303
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,430
but unless it doesn't get dark she is
not a hurry

304
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:50,760
Hill said she says why you

305
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,660
have it here long lines and this one
your computer only three bites

306
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:58,720
well the person who made a mistake just
simple copy paste is coming this mistake

307
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,490
as a soldier

308
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:05,420
kit to perhaps this line coveted here
hex every place by the city's but three

309
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,720
as it was to me it became tree so we
compare wrong

310
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,240
thinks and it's almost unrealistic to
see the set

311
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,240
heiress and I did see a lot of records
accordingly says somewhere Prentice's is

312
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:17,870
improbably

313
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:23,170
to install it's difficult to perceive
next

314
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:26,660
what dynamic about this cannot do

315
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:30,620
it's not a salvation from it's also good
for example are you didn't put

316
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:34,870
apprentice in the right place then we
have a size of it's not even 20 yet

317
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,059
one you should put together to buy but
you about 11 bite

318
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:42,510
from the 4-yard endemic analysis not
here we have not

319
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:46,270
left the threshold commemorating was
initialized but for some reason

320
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:49,679
person should compare function mem CPE
one by

321
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,270
a dick what is absolutely correct but
some pairs in principle they cannot be

322
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,340
case by dynamic analyzes from their
point of view it is correct

323
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:01,380
by statistical analyzer can see those
errors they also

324
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:06,040
have schedule liza also is not a
suitable at an example

325
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:10,860
for example his dad special love the
massive or not for example we have read

326
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,990
some numbers isn't a single template
that made

327
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:16,130
and instead legal knowledge ELISA has no
data

328
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,870
and for the dynamic analyzer which case
this character in execution so we'll get

329
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:20,570
some data

330
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:24,590
it will analyze it and then we'll have
output outside of the

331
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:28,490
arrayed study one will not see because
he's not his age executing the problem

332
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:31,030
but the fifth execuse the problems
endemic analysts

333
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:34,390
so this is an example but this show you

334
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:40,130
that all tools have their own
deficiencies so don't try to find the

335
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:43,760
silver bullet use them all in context

336
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,200
tools are different at the all-important

337
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,830
and we have produced one of those tools
and right now nothing that would like to

338
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,230
give you

339
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:54,050
about usual static allies as well it's
right it's a very important part

340
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:59,510
and it won't matter how you can use
analyzer is to take and shed

341
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:03,010
course you have checked it headset while
everything good

342
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:06,080
14 no no

343
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,450
these and allergy is like errors

344
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:14,410
of compiler you have not switched all
the compilers warnings

345
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:17,560
am downhill program for one

346
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:23,660
your your shaking the you did you buy a
gain UK shoulder buy seats a

347
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,560
painful and in the once a year you have
switched at the warning and then

348
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,150
corrected

349
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:31,410
no role demeaning warnings is to correct
this as early as possible the same

350
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,480
static analysis

351
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,240
its actually an extension of your

352
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,980
work all the work the compiler to
discover said GFX deeper

353
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,500
more precisely so by lodging

354
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,560
analyzing Eliza love regularly you KH

355
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,570
terrace at the early stage possible at
the moment when you

356
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:53,100
bringing it doesn't even come to the
deaths the all our test but the big

357
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,100
number of the same titles

358
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:59,770
can easily caged that's why it is
important

359
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:04,010
to do it regulates the best example the
same thing for example you change a QA

360
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:07,840
book one piece you put it in words you
have changed the or for coffee

361
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,690
well it's not clear white needed because
everything is right white because a

362
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:17,540
correct 27 correcting need will is some
other method in testing

363
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,810
well it makes no sense but EU tight new
texting the word

364
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:25,040
and dandy it's much more useful right
well thank you very much for your

365
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,970
attention and I'm ready to answer your
questions

366
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:31,350
questions to have left yes in

367
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:34,680
what speaking in like from trees

368
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:50,100
we can hear you

369
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:54,290
hello take much for your presentation I
was always interested

370
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:58,850
obviously you're unless you use for
Texas Tech's

371
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,860
pattern matching method

372
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:05,360
in your statistical tree right is that
true

373
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,440
well we bill a tree

374
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,890
not obstructs in technical tree but far
as it is important to have different

375
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,880
joints which formed up some point of
view are

376
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,930
extra external apprentices but we need
all this is some friends is another

377
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:19,340
team's

378
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:22,920
because when the channel everything
because it gives a subtle hints and then

379
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,130
a by making a point to the tree we
collect some information

380
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:29,670
but every diagnostic lance is unique and
it's different

381
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:33,660
from point to point yes it's
understandable but it's interesting to

382
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,040
me

383
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,170
do you use intern representation

384
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,530
well more complex meta-analysis like

385
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:43,980
some simple did for Knox's

386
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,120
russian-speaking if you have two
pointers

387
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,740
and

388
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,200
day are placed in different magicians
well

389
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,210
ally sing is not considered for us does
simple data flow but statistical unless

390
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,210
it's a very limited

391
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:04,230
they cannot do everything if they start
passing and the militant big volunteer

392
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,720
work very slow or very

393
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,960
bed but if some Bluetooth will need

394
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,040
then you can stop it and forget about it
yes

395
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,300
available but fairly and principal

396
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,890
this is the problems that still lies
some people do deeper something

397
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:25,100
do it shallow but it's very difficult so
you don't feel

398
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:30,440
are more sense in Texas

399
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,600
well as a big number of observations and
users

400
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,040
say that they discover something sweet
need some examples

401
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,500
and some patterns are religion often so
we try to realize them

402
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,179
in the search and were more
concentrating

403
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:48,330
on tide falls discovery we use some
trickle methods

404
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:52,570
when we look at the cold and we start
making assumptions with you from HX

405
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:56,040
for example insane call for peace things
we built up matrix

406
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,720
and when we look but some anomalies in
the majors is everything was good here

407
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,530
and then suddenly

408
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:05,630
stands out some British in maybe it's a
title and it's a very rough explanation

409
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:06,740
members that 70s

410
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:13,580
okay thank you thank you more how

411
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:17,070
regularly should this can be by the
ideal option

412
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:21,820
incremental now says you're going to the
nation from logically in the background

413
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,190
not usually how it is done

414
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:27,520
analyzes been started and then it works
if it comes to warning then you see a

415
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,360
warning window please pay attention to
these

416
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:35,050
is the ideal auction then uses warning
if you cannot do like death for example

417
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:38,940
hey you are not developing officials to
you can preset

418
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,309
the gym cumpilation or light assembly so

419
00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:45,490
we receive the report and now we check
our sales

420
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:49,100
every night which cells and then we
receive the said

421
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:54,730
report by email I don't like answering
this question because

422
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:58,380
it seriously can't be reduced or coming
let level

423
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:02,540
because you know how it usually happens
when some mark russia is not successful

424
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:06,130
and yes all positive 2000 but the

425
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:10,120
we suppress this Marcus and down 1900

426
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:17,229
disappeared

427
00:25:17,229 --> 00:25:19,999
so in the morning have to spend four
hours to analyze it

428
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:23,129
well this is the end individual tell you
which mechanisms

429
00:25:23,129 --> 00:25:26,989
we use for these yes thanks very much to
expect that

430
00:25:26,989 --> 00:25:31,009
historical analysts will become
commodity in building two compiler

431
00:25:31,009 --> 00:25:34,469
they are built on compilers was only in
Windows they have p.m.

432
00:25:34,469 --> 00:25:37,719
and for some justices sufficient but
professional products it's

433
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:51,879
like for the shop which cost money well
this is my knowledge

434
00:25:51,879 --> 00:26:00,380
who invents those rules

435
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,770
there's no least those

436
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:08,280
matters that have to be realized but
users constantly San something sauce

437
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:13,050
the different users and potential uses
the right to us that perhaps there's

438
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:13,730
something in it

439
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:17,990
and it should be done we also develop
some things when you read something

440
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:18,850
simple and we

441
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:22,200
tell somethings there is no formal
process

442
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,600
I don't hear question common purpose

443
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,740
about 230 plus

444
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:34,000
have Shelby rules such position rules
but they are not as interesting

445
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,680
that'd thank you very much

446
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,130
was black
