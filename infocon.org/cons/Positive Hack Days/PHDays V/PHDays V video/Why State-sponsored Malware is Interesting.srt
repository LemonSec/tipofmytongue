1
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:04,910
here

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,970
yet it's on the rooster Malo everybody

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,429
so my name is Alexander and today we're
going to talk

4
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:15,599
about the reason Kaspersky Lab

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,779
studies the target attacked

6
00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:24,300
arranged by nation-state

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,420
this is a a nation governments and why
and how and what does the

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,930
tricks on the way so allow us to start
with the general things

9
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,180
our

10
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:45,760
Billard mister case lol waving his hand
so I am talking about the battle

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,059
warm Regine reg in bed all warm

12
00:00:49,059 --> 00:00:52,100
and we published our report about it

13
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,510
her last year this is one of them Omnia

14
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:00,930
number types of proof of the level of
the spy program

15
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,150
malware program that even people all
that

16
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:09,820
her position make here to talk about it
and recently we've heard news about the

17
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,320
White House email

18
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,299
hacking and their immediately a

19
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:19,850
Russian hackers so have been accused
without

20
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:23,640
any through for details how and why it
was

21
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,210
and one was open to recently we
published a report to the about a group

22
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,850
named Duke and they

23
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,409
modification of the cozy Duke which

24
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,189
a is obviously of Russian origin have
that has been

25
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:47,000
responsible for the same intrusion into
the white house email system

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,320
but we need to understand that Dukas a
family of malware

27
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,360
mmm their programs we have been
monitoring

28
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,520
them for several years they definitely
have some Russian

29
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,469
jeans in it tender in their way is that
sir

30
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:08,959
an indicator that we as a Russian
company

31
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,950
will not

32
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,660
a tried to cover up for their

33
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,130
tax done

34
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:23,240
by Russian government a special service
history some boomer publication

35
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,450
which EU must have read when them

36
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,880
our company was accused her

37
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,360
for you know eaten

38
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,500
having fun with KGB agents in this sauna

39
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,520
Kaka so Kaspersky Lab thats that's why
Kaspersky Lab never publisher's

40
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,860
information about their

41
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,200
attacks with Russian origin but her

42
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,540
if you consider the truth it's
absolutely wrong

43
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,290
you we look at them statistics

44
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,720
up our published researcher reports sooo

45
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,570
since 2010 when we published

46
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:05,770
information about Stuxnet

47
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,270
them and snowballing

48
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:14,680
attacks arranged by different government
sir and in 2014

49
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,790
with published over 10 a reports

50
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,400
and articles about malware are

51
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,239
from origin eating from a estate

52
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,709
some government and that we need to
understand that the number of such

53
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,660
attacks her is going up

54
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,730
lately and

55
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:38,500
anti-virus industry this security
industry on the whole

56
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,790
now all companies are trying to find a

57
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:48,260
their own approach you because

58
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,290
issues arise and many companies prefer
to focus on the

59
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:57,109
something

60
00:03:57,109 --> 00:04:00,530
very narrow for instance so companies so
that

61
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:05,519
only do Chinese target the text they do
it well

62
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,719
but they're completely ignoring

63
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:11,849
all other threats and very own phone

64
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:15,180
they don't have protection from malware

65
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,970
from other state

66
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,919
and it's no no joke one of such
companies still does not have

67
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:26,669
any Regine detection

68
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:30,680
where we started what kind of origin:
never heard about the

69
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,750
this name and I'm so

70
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,270
or what's happening when we have from

71
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:44,090
ideological battle

72
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,490
among countries and when companies says
ther

73
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,720
to play on once I start to be siding

74
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,770
or play it over national to

75
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,740
trying to fight to the

76
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,139
nm is and they're paying no tension

77
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:04,669
any malware

78
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:07,720
any other malware this is where you
there firm

79
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,300
many people selected but we selected
something else

80
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,669
the city's the

81
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:19,740
picture about company's server
specialized sir

82
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,840
on Chinese attacks so

83
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,080
first this crowd strike infographics
where 41

84
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,449
group

85
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:34,500
so 41 group of Chinese origin has been
detected

86
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,030
so everything they find is China and

87
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,540
I love and the

88
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,510
respect crowd striker have many friends
for

89
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,800
and they even I'm wearing the t-shirt to

90
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,310
but it is safe simple and safer

91
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,220
you know ever freeway but we

92
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,540
have decided

93
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,920
to do differently we decided to

94
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,890
to make no exception for malware

95
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:10,660
of Western origin or Russian origin

96
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,060
E with take their

97
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:20,120
latest most famous examples we

98
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,600
phone starkness do call

99
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,760
and others equation

100
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,470
that we discovered in February and then

101
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:34,600
we also have the same least

102
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,220
for Russian names me do Red October at
spy

103
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:45,420
cost me Duke and a pic to return why

104
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,360
did you decide

105
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:56,200
to study nation-state malware

106
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,410
their to

107
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:07,070
thousand pick one question that's

108
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,150
the movie the most interesting thing

109
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:13,890
over the last few years and all the
threats

110
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:17,090
can be looked upon as a pyramid

111
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:21,070
where they largest a bottom way here

112
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:24,240
is there conventional malware

113
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,800
by the people who want door total to
send spam

114
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,810
now

115
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:34,189
deaf event that the steal money from the
banks it's over ninety percent

116
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:39,629
of that traffic three hot 300,000 new
samples every day

117
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:46,300
them and family here that has to do

118
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,990
was targeted tax so hacker group who

119
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:54,270
can were ca by order

120
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,879
were that Kim worker you know

121
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:02,069
at random if we still something we shall
find a buyer for it

122
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:05,270
that's their motto

123
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,620
so some hackers are anonymous and

124
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:13,550
ideological AT&T very little

125
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:19,250
we will share our farm detected

126
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,379
attacks that have been originated

127
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:26,819
by government by states that bad the big

128
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:30,199
the juiciest beast in the security
industry

129
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:33,750
so today we

130
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,240
show have a discussion where

131
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,419
we'll try to

132
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:43,449
come see either the both coins

133
00:08:43,449 --> 00:08:46,940
work both sides of the coin as we
publish all reports

134
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,949
we present at various conferences but

135
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:54,680
offline we meet people sometimes

136
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,209
who probably

137
00:08:57,209 --> 00:09:00,110
have to do with those malware

138
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,759
software we may

139
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:08,019
read something we may you learn
something else was a great crime

140
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:11,170
and it

141
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,470
enables us to I am

142
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,309
think like those people on the other
side

143
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:23,269
how they do it why do it and want to
think about us

144
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:31,259
and today so

145
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:34,990
over on behalf of those says hooks their
vitaly

146
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:44,310
is going to talk on behalf of the
cyberspace

147
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,460
my name is vitaly and they work now no I

148

so

150
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,610
for for the last ten years I have been
working in Kaspersky Lab but

151
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:04,080
no I he I am NOT working anywhere

152
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,760
I'm not officially employed so I'm

153
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,980
I can now speak on behalf of the other
side and

154
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,790
I'll protector I'll defend the

155

who can have more and

167
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:04,470
most important to us. waiting here how
are you going to make a presentation to

168
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,970
make it compliant we don't care

169
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:14,780
we are compliant because we are as a law

170
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,230
so speaking about the anti-virus company

171
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:21,010
different we home

172
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:24,420
we who look up to them we

173
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:29,940
have for limited budget we have some

174
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:35,910
30 percent R&D of the budget for 444

175
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,950
for research but those people have been
concerned though they don't have to

176
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,070
spend on marketing and sales so

177
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,350
while we have to and the

178
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:50,440
we for are in permanent search for a
good balance

179
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,170
researchers and indeed sometimes it
takes years

180
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:57,270
to find a good expert

181
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:00,400
for instance Kaspersky Lab

182
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:06,630
virtually well for two years have been
searched Ching

183
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:10,270
for the experts in Israel well

184
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:15,020
seems to be a country that's packed her
with a good programmers and security

185
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,220
guys but probably

186
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:20,720
its I'm her our plank is too high or the
situation is so poor

187
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,560
that it takes a two years to find the
proper guy

188
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,210
but then no no no they have been working
for you for a long time you didn't just

189
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,100
know about it

190
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:36,410
well that some that's an option anther

191
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:39,910
angry year

192
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:43,570
indeed we improve our technology
probably is a breakthrough

193
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:47,280
revolutionary event has become the cloud

194
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:52,240
in particular we call it karma Kaspersky
Security Network this is

195
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,540
our main tool which enables us

196
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,560
in a real-time to detect

197
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,220
new attacks globally we used to wait

198
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:08,130
before when the user's find something
suspicious

199
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:11,170
for in this computer send it to us then
we have a look

200
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:15,270
and then we detect and we don't know
their holistic situation

201
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:18,279
now 8 hair

202
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:21,660
has turned around completely we can find
it

203
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,980
easy we fastly and a no matter where we

204
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,670
kind of you know go like to a
supermarket hey let's have a look

205
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:33,079
what are the suspicious files in Vatican

206
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:39,439
we have clients in Vatican to clients or
in not in the North Korea

207
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:43,649
and in this way in the region us who we
are where we

208
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:49,040
we can suspect some threats weekend
easily find them so we have a really

209
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,059
cut the response time we understand the

210
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:56,980
for what we are looking for is just the
tip of the iceberg

211
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:01,129
probably one percent of all the target
that tax arranged by

212
00:14:01,129 --> 00:14:04,259
nation-state to agencies

213
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:09,230
but differently we see that there's much
more but we focus on a single

214
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:13,209
task in this situation we need to
protect

215
00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:19,930
our users people pay this money people
trust us so we need to

216
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:24,920
protect them independently all the

217
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,370
origin of this malware is it and

218
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:31,939
an individual hacker once

219
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:35,040
22 inches while it or escape

220
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,279
who wants to control this guy there's no
difference

221
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:41,730
so that's why we were how we work thank
you for the clout

222
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:45,779
because it goes through I'll Fibre
Channel and their

223
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:49,100
let us arrange a small

224
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,670
show of the arguments and I would like a

225
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:57,809
to show here that you are free

226
00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:01,079
to 'em side up with us

227
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:06,439
dark side or the white side and we would
request you to vote

228
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:12,990
for the strongest arguments so as for
the zero-day vulnerability

229
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:16,059
we have unrestricted unlimited excess

230
00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:19,249
we have our own exploiter

231
00:15:19,249 --> 00:15:23,220
writers there's black market who which
where you can go and

232
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:28,290
anonymously by any exploit for any
product

233
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:31,009
we have our favorite

234
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:35,049
vendor least but we prefer

235
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:38,309
colonel exploits

236
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:42,350
because their them most efficient we can
now

237
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,569
be successful once and that's it

238
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,689
then you don't have to worry

239
00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:54,429
and chose to build your infrastructure
when bitterly says

240
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:57,919
that they have many 0 days that's true

241
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:01,269
but its their week wink

242
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:04,889
in the chain veer

243
00:16:04,889 --> 00:16:08,230
exactly zero day addictive every target
attack

244
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:12,220
arranged by estate try

245
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,809
uses 0 day von their ability

246
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:21,279
and that when I go back two years so
that we spend the fighting there

247
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:27,249
conventional as cybercrime urs so 0 they
probably you know we could detect once a

248
00:16:27,249 --> 00:16:27,730
year

249
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:32,489
but when we look at their I

250
00:16:32,489 --> 00:16:36,519
government state a software we discover

251
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:41,100
now several 0 days a year

252
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,419
so somehow 0 days for Windows

253
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:52,529
and Doman Java now search for these 20
days is our favorite

254
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:56,549
pastime as to stimulus impetus

255
00:16:56,549 --> 00:17:01,169
why because sir virtually always

256
00:17:01,169 --> 00:17:04,419
even we find that there

257
00:17:04,419 --> 00:17:07,429
something new 0 day that's us yeah

258
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:11,230
and tell you more we

259
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,760
target our technologists in products

260
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,279
and are traps technology and collection
technology

261
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:22,610
exclusively 40 day search

262
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:27,540
we focus not so much

263
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,020
malware exports find

264
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:34,890
you find that the rest this is a
starting point

265
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,220
you to on wrong you know role

266
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,730
row rollout the change in to

267
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,990
permanently use more and more 0 the Acer

268
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:49,520
and for them their problem

269
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,429
is after we find it the immediately lose

270
00:17:53,429 --> 00:17:58,400
a law lot of tools of their

271
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,320
efficiency and efficiency really goes
down

272
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,940
and its ones we discover this zero-day

273
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,340
veer you years

274
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:13,580
of their activity are down the drain I'm

275
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:17,290
have you ever

276
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:20,400
gone mushrooming to forest have you ever
seen

277
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:31,580
mushrooms that somebody collected and
put that's what you're getting guys

278
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:35,809
alright tell me as for the crypto

279
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:40,570
we finance it

280
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:43,769
we boost

281
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:49,110
your mind sir so that you would the
great wonderful crypto algorithms and

282
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,639
then

283
00:18:49,639 --> 00:18:54,200
we can sign our own

284
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,129
malware with wonderful certificates

285
00:18:59,129 --> 00:19:05,059
that we disseminate and you believe that
they use wonderful cryptography and you

286
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:05,889
can trust

287
00:19:05,889 --> 00:19:11,059
the digital signature we define three

288
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:14,450
force you to select

289
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:20,419
the proper on stamps and we create
standards once you deviate from this

290
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:22,019
standard you are not

291
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:25,220
so-called orthodox programmer

292
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,220
and to for

293
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:33,730
our home malware we select right cost us
with more D

294
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:37,830
fireball algorithm so for you know

295
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:41,049
was a do we just send their trash

296
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:48,279
to people but we and crypt our protocol
in a very secure way

297
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:51,429
well when you sign your

298
00:19:51,429 --> 00:19:55,730
malware with a certificate Microsoft

299
00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:00,460
this way you actually Subhash

300
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,700
the bases of information security

301
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,799
across the globe yes all

302
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,580
infrastructure of crypto keys

303
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,139
is built on trust there is a
certification center

304
00:20:14,139 --> 00:20:17,519
that issue a certificate so that should
control

305
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:21,169
the execution and everybody believes
this system

306
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:24,399
is built on trust and at a certain
moment

307
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:29,059
where getting air mister come look

308
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:33,909
from and ABC Company who just a
well-taken

309
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:38,519
use certificate Microsoft certificate

310
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:42,070
sign programs and then Microsoft has a

311
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:47,139
to re retreat took her to revoke all the
file some

312
00:20:47,139 --> 00:20:51,379
met lots of problems what's your last
name

313
00:20:51,379 --> 00:20:54,440
services this is

314
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,690
so we're doing everything is to make you
happy in more words

315
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,869
we have examples of successful

316
00:21:00,869 --> 00:21:05,039
you solve our fighting attacks feel some
date

317
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,389
when the state computers trying to
download

318
00:21:09,389 --> 00:21:13,009
the Windows updates &

319
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:16,820
Windows Update something else in store
also spy

320
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:22,369
software is installed will stay the
Windows Update so any

321
00:21:22,369 --> 00:21:25,749
similar technologies so they destroy

322
00:21:25,749 --> 00:21:30,119
the security environment and

323
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:34,440
become such a release your and and the
use of Halle

324
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:39,460
types of crypto algorithms sites can
never

325
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:43,419
around iraq for us and thus overlook

326
00:21:43,419 --> 00:21:46,749
have to so file which communiques

327
00:21:46,749 --> 00:21:48,839
server and

328
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:51,529
and screw encrypting the data

329
00:21:51,529 --> 00:21:54,889
and so the c6 algorithm for example

330
00:21:54,889 --> 00:21:58,739
so whole president left in the world
gone can use this

331
00:21:58,739 --> 00:22:02,609
horses 6 so they're quite or very few

332
00:22:02,609 --> 00:22:06,889
okay organizations like that who can use
such

333
00:22:06,889 --> 00:22:10,559
freshen your pressure developed
algorithms

334
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:15,519
and this by the way a sign at work or if
I such a tax is the most challenging

335
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:20,330
and we attributed to and they're so we
think that

336
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,609
estate has initiated this one Hesse
because

337
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:28,219
RC 6 being so complicated so if you want
something

338
00:22:28,219 --> 00:22:35,739
simpler to use Camelia another point

339
00:22:35,739 --> 00:22:39,309
our her mile away is the best its

340
00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:44,219
the most complex and where do the
research cybercrime research and

341
00:22:44,219 --> 00:22:49,950
so overuse zeros more miles so this is
just nothing so serious and

342
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:55,489
peanuts compared to you this one so you
think that you sent the

343
00:22:55,489 --> 00:22:58,769
said the plank said the site Sam

344
00:22:58,769 --> 00:23:02,519
law no hackers it's not so they saw this

345
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:05,629
the so this at the target was set for

346
00:23:05,629 --> 00:23:07,669
much higher and

347
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:10,330
many how much earlier than you did

348
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,619
summer where cyber crime is nothing her

349
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:16,979
because cuss our modules no one sees

350
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:20,080
no sono no one sees our old kids

351
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,450
because will not work try again where
you will not be able

352
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:27,599
I think of a looking for us and because
we have many

353
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:31,070
attributes over your standard file
systems

354
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:34,979
and so we put all his best together we
can and compression

355
00:23:34,979 --> 00:23:39,179
in encryption and we can keep our own
files inside

356
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:42,589
no one would what's it mean Iran idk for
a

357
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:47,830
and an advanced IT guy work people I
would even think that this file system

358
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:48,349
could be

359
00:23:48,349 --> 00:23:52,279
about on top of this kind of stores and
history

360
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:57,649
for camp even a so we can now

361
00:23:57,649 --> 00:24:01,269
output viruses in your hard drives and

362
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:04,679
so we can do anything say micro Colts
can be

363
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:08,299
had damaged as well can be in fact it is
well we can do the

364
00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:12,509
is this infection and the south and

365
00:24:12,509 --> 00:24:16,929
malware Harper inserted into the hard
drives

366
00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:20,599
and so then in fact it hard drives

367
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:23,700
sorry so that's that's a bad thing

368
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:27,749
for a surprise for us sign for acting
the hard drives

369
00:24:27,749 --> 00:24:31,279
and I can tell you that it's a great
challenge for us

370
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:36,249
right now sir there is no a single
technology in the world right now that

371
00:24:36,249 --> 00:24:37,349
would be capable

372
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:41,429
homer taking out of the system

373
00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:44,519
identify the changed to

374
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:48,789
to change that software because for
example

375
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:53,690
your your hard drive for hasn't been
modified with the help of this program

376
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:54,330
or not

377
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,730
and

378
00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:00,280
and soured on the way to fight to this
thread is

379
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:04,830
if you suspect that your hard drives
have been compromised

380
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:08,310
so don't have to do is just to take your
hard drive and

381
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:11,780
and destroy it with a hammer and a and

382
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:15,640
throw it into the garbage can trash can

383
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,640
as the only way to fight for

384
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,610
this malware Anderson hatcheries

385
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:28,950
modulus so they're so the

386
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:33,340
days to have so those who refuse to how
to do business with us

387
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,660
have this this in fact that more jews

388
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,780
constitution is not as bad yes it on
your roster

389
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,870
to represent because the more technology
the use

390
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:49,260
the better they try to hide Adams to
hide the infected files and the system

391
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:53,460
so using the core of the system so the
more they attempt to do that

392
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,119
so the more the

393
00:25:56,119 --> 00:26:00,570
the more chances that will find them
will find because what we're trying to

394
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:04,519
her I saw

395
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:08,720
Kansas helps us to find a way to to
fight with firmware

396
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,690
there's no breakthrough unfortunately
but detection on the FS system said and

397
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,330
parsing is quite possible

398
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:18,840
Anderson taking the hardware looking for

399
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,519
so malware module so so this has been
done to it it's a standard

400
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:29,519
de facto her system so we can see that
the southern army officer protection

401
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,059
which risk and can

402
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:37,179
can fight those attacks in the
guaranteed fashion

403
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:40,549
and suffers daily users spokes

404
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:43,960
and indeed getting to the Turkish has a
traditional cyber

405
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,349
criminals and what is it reading

406
00:26:47,349 --> 00:26:51,580
this Canada sup across any this
subsector discreetly

407
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:56,349
this work unit now and their and so
there is no defense

408
00:26:56,349 --> 00:27:00,239
against us and your you think so we
cannot defend

409
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:04,580
defend yourself against terror attacks
so remembering

410
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:10,519
how budget and and our capabilities it's
impossible to fight against her

411
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:14,700
so even if you try we can attack you
from different things work and explore

412
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,499
I work and go through your provider for
example that provides data centers

413
00:27:18,499 --> 00:27:21,529
hosting internet channel so we can go
through your provider

414
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:25,019
and if ur the difficulties with the
provider

415
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:28,070
we we're headed in fact country and

416
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:31,190
so they would only way out so then the

417
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:34,769
so we can just go through the fiber
optics to the

418
00:27:34,769 --> 00:27:37,840
think internet or

419
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,259
or just for her on a budget that's your
watch ever satellites

420
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:46,789
can hair put our own centre-right some
next to your satellite that would

421
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:47,519
intercept

422
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:50,940
hold the waves and all the transmission
signals

423
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,200
go to the for the

424
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,880
your satellites will everything
solutions racial

425
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,980
intercepted by our I am

426
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:04,720
I I don't know what to say

427
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,370
because the things that those guys are
doing so the quite

428
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:14,380
censor it difficult to to stop

429
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:18,350
very difficult 27 difficult to identify
and isolate them

430
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:22,290
therefore can stop in later said because
when the company under attack

431
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:26,500
or our individual cannot possibly
protector

432
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,570
himself for with the help of available
technologies

433
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:33,800
because there's always Alamosa level at
which

434
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,960
an attack kar occurs but such a

435
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,210
actions force different countries in the
world tour

436
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:46,590
develop injured you're certain you level
so protection at the national level

437
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:50,090
and I was stalking server has ordered

438
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:53,850
everyone wants to two separate their own
national side

439
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:57,760
on the internet and build their own and
develop their own rules because this is

440
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,360
certainly the implication I work

441
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,900
and they were snowed in force them
because either slow then told the truth

442
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:06,370
through the whole world in how the
special agencies

443
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:10,410
United States are spying on the Internet
and

444
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:14,910
some not just you all know that Russia
recently has taken a lot

445
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:19,470
are steps not on a nice lady about
technical I'm efforts to isolate those

446
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,190
segments

447
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:24,920
but now the situation is the task have
protection of companies corporates

448
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,460
a the individual so living and a certain
state

449
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:32,450
his responsibility of the state now and
there is no higher

450
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:35,540
to authority

451
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,970
and and the service riotous these
budgets

452
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:43,550
so we'll have to fight other countries
budgets and eventually it will be a

453
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,060
hassle

454
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,370
erase a snowball

455
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:50,710
under the problem most noble and this
will ensure air

456
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:53,790
so the so the burden

457
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:57,660
will will well well several

458
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,830
before every company so we would use
because we're

459
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:04,400
needs to be implemented would be
implemented by the state

460
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,630
this August making it easier for the
company's factory

461
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:12,140
and then so they would beat them strip
that too take measures to just try to

462
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,990
destroy the security system

463
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:17,390
are home the or the state sorted 10

464
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:21,260
to to invent have a virus that would
destroy the system

465
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:25,740
they will not go around AntiVir solution
so they will replace

466
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,780
with someday with her with the
compromise to

467
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:34,510
severe Windows updates without windows
update

468
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:38,660
if you do not release patches so you not
install them

469
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:42,580
so everything everything just chill will
stop functioning so

470
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:47,420
I saw it here in Chinese so well will go
and start hacking

471
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:51,740
all the computers and campaign in the
world sort people

472
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:55,080
are apps destroying what day

473
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:59,540
need themselves for their so I'll so I
did I just trying so this

474
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:03,450
this sacred cow updates window updates
and

475
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:06,880
so than in 2012 gore was saying at the
time

476
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,429
did not know about the 75 collisions

477
00:31:11,429 --> 00:31:16,300
and Ashley Moser said a judge generator

478
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,870
so I falsa microsoftr

479
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:22,880
certificate one-on-one completely

480
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,059
combine was king coincided with the with
illegal

481
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:30,900
certificates instead of cryptography
dick

482
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,980
the

483
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:36,870
the cartographers so another tour

484
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:40,060
on the 10 or 10 persists in the world
mathematicians

485
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:43,610
the highest level can do that her so and
then

486
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:48,720
have huge computing power they require
only ten persons were can do that

487
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,170
and so very few countries can do that
pursue their

488
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:56,160
so they're ready to go to that expense
to

489
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,170
replace one certificate with another one
but at the same time

490
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:04,240
days infrastructure security in general
gets destroyed

491
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,570
and and that's why it's a dub double
hedged

492
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:10,700
a sword that will

493
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,900
that will stab you in the back
eventually given a

494
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:19,260
no updates a summer produce a small a
small amber saver can hack

495
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:24,850
there so we can do something else are so
your progress report you have the

496
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:25,890
prospered updates

497
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:29,740
down the whole world his shaking with
fear

498
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:34,150
so let's talk about the victim so who
are you attacking

499
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:38,060
with the King work in attacking Iran

500
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:42,300
so we don't have to be modest everything
is legal

501
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,790
providers do some operators here it

502
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:49,780
all Kiss Kiss Kiss Kiss cutter does
anyone

503
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:53,410
jean-jacques is Qatar do have any crypt
over for us here

504
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:57,200
doing you know kiss his cutter

505
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,110
kiss Carter person Belgian tripped over
for

506
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:06,220
and we were helping him to to select the
this magic Constance

507
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:10,220
that work the best she she spoke about
that

508
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,370
and and us are here

509
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:18,470
is Makosi to

510
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,980
political political

511
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:24,230
for some has no direct access to the
computer works

512
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:29,549
Federer through me so any nenu victim so
when makes them with terrorists are

513
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,859
using the same cold

514
00:33:30,859 --> 00:33:35,039
so once a written euros everywhere so
very efficient

515
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:41,169
and the works miss the profession so
these guys

516
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:46,059
i doing Harley this here they're saying
that they're doing on your work is legal

517
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:50,059
so they keep saying that they love it
surveyed appeared as a mentor

518
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:53,109
and that the foldable from

519
00:33:53,109 --> 00:33:57,649
and the and comply with the law but once
we have to study this attack

520
00:33:57,649 --> 00:34:02,080
any kinda but accuracy that that

521
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,809
the that the victims are her specific
conversant you

522
00:34:06,809 --> 00:34:09,970
different plan so victims and when it

523
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:14,030
when it goes to insure the public domain
and

524
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:17,129
and becomes known to everyone so there

525
00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:20,609
despite this espionage was illegal

526
00:34:20,609 --> 00:34:26,950
this act of spying was not only illegal
but to destroy the relations between two

527
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:27,599
states

528
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,839
brought about many many conflicts eso
the

529
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,929
hacking farrakhan that's what the hell
for the combat warm

530
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:39,129
has some behind which the British
Special Services

531
00:34:39,129 --> 00:34:42,669
stilled yes I'm not only brought about
the parliamentary

532
00:34:42,669 --> 00:34:46,230
hearings in the into dudes Belgian
Parliament

533
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:50,210
the problem was escalated was created to
the level

534
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,790
the turkey in Union

535
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:57,600
the her because to two countries members

536
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,450
are the see your and in a two-member sir

537
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:06,780
and her us they all were concerned is it
legal

538
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:10,700
long definitely not was illegal and the

539
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,430
and what they do so the they stop for

540
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:17,780
the policeman 28 doughnuts not they

541
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:21,320
the restricted they restricted the
relationship with the

542
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,910
with the British special services
because

543
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:30,170
can bring about to the the worsening on
general

544
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:33,250
relations sir so much using the same

545
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:36,620
malware platform to attack different
victims

546
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:41,570
and missus one of the strongest one of
the biggest challenges

547
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:44,770
for the for the government spies

548
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:49,330
because what we need to do is to find
one module and then we immediately find

549
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:50,140
all modules

550
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:53,180
because there's always a platform so
there are more juice

551
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:56,310
and then there is a certain handling

552
00:35:56,310 --> 00:36:00,490
infrastructure so getting the module you
get the platform in them

553
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:04,560
and then the way identify midler all
victims along with the world

554
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,690
irrespective for

555
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:10,410
ok with a heart and it and it was saying
about the

556
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:13,690
america's hate this is a real story and
their

557
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:17,140
and are not

558
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:22,290
are not naming this mill where program
reckon course in earnest ignition the

559
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:22,590
way

560
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:25,630
came to the company were found one of
the victims in German

561
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:29,690
and a so the only the only victim in
Germany

562
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:34,240
actually and hi you

563
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,140
you heard that custer's killer oratory
for

564
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:41,960
forecasters the worker Germany is one of
the biggest national markets

565
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:46,180
powerful car spares your lap and they
have good relations

566
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:50,590
where with the German police and so or
maybe you have the biggest market

567
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:51,060
because

568
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,840
because we have good relations with the
police and they're so we

569
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,900
were transferred all the information
that we have identified

570
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,600
to them in

571
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:02,230
or Sunday detailed a special group for
for check

572
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:05,850
and ass after house are you hit the
jackpot guys

573
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:09,020
hand and within say

574
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:12,530
who is the victim but her but they were
very grateful

575
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:16,900
this that we hit the jackpot finding the
the victim

576
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:20,950
because the plank was very high and the
person who are so high

577
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:24,390
so high standing person dead and never
came across as before

578
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:28,150
and on Sunday Merkel's a

579
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:31,930
Reese there were some mentions about

580
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:37,840
this underwent when the programs I use
to simultaneously

581
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,920
at the in fact the members of the
government's and

582
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:46,310
simultaneous to the same try on is used
in fact Islamic terrorists

583
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:49,970
and so we have no choice now

584
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:55,130
where I left no choice and finding these
things we have to talk about their

585
00:37:55,130 --> 00:38:00,200
when there were no to when it to make it
does does reprieve providing

586
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,540
107 you're saving the world I was saving

587
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:07,400
not only from infection not not only
Merkel's ain't bad

588
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,060
the by the bad guys terrorists are saved
as well but you

589
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:14,640
you force us to do that and

590
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,530
so the Dells circus ex-nasa because the
play by the rules

591
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:22,950
and we churry don't work in you were
officially so

592
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:26,220
re so which do we don't have to comply
with the time

593
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,780
it's true

594
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,960
collect everything interest you
everything so we're just bad guys in

595
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,000
love collecting stuff

596
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,720
so a correct method data from your
documents

597
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:43,609
pasa Iran Iran remote finds a way even
if you insert

598
00:38:43,609 --> 00:38:48,960
and a memory stick you think it's clean
it's not end there so we take your

599
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,550
remote

600
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:54,760
documents and we appropriate them site
under protective computers

601
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:59,200
way you're not year you're not safe from
the screenshots

602
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,150
and make screenshots captures keyboards
accordion

603
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:06,890
and your Internet traffic sign on your

604
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:10,010
no much your your favorite programs

605
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:13,460
everything and nursery you steal
everything we collect everything in

606
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,380
store care for

607
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:17,790
so the least is is endless and

608
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:21,150
writer not being modest three take a
call

609
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:25,500
and then one day we'll analyze sage is
better to say for sure

610
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,560
firms so then

611
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:33,369
does irresponsible thieves

612
00:39:33,369 --> 00:39:38,030
from now this clip to clip the Manics

613
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:42,880
they all follow some this this is
propensity to

614
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,349
steel everything to catch everything to
intercept everything

615
00:39:46,349 --> 00:39:49,670
and %uh so this this desire this urge

616
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:53,980
this urged to get as much as possible
under

617
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:57,990
sure so that can be easily caught
Patrick

618
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:01,520
because anti and and icky at anti

619
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,540
a keylogger attack works and it works
very well

620
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:09,329
and them so than so it looks like this
guy should refer

621
00:40:09,329 --> 00:40:13,099
phat about them but the more the
contractor

622
00:40:13,099 --> 00:40:16,250
Demi Moore their presence in this system
is is

623
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:19,550
is all this and a long as they steal

624
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:23,319
and hi these is huge

625
00:40:23,319 --> 00:40:26,660
so they missed you too much traffic is
still a huge truck

626
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:29,360
which is easily detected

627
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:33,590
and especially so they're urge hurt you

628
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:37,120
to pump out this stole information in

629
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,220
of powers some on her and

630
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:43,380
someone at night for example at the
office

631
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:48,710
so the computer that no one is seeding
so all of a sudden it starts to send

632
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:51,980
G gigabyte so of trafficker

633
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:55,570
outside and the service is the weakest
spot

634
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:58,890
and that's right how to catch them
because we can

635
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:07,560
red-handed know what they're going to do
but not this is the simplest method

636
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:12,580
to identified and that the science that
that's old is

637
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:17,520
volumes of stolen data this is something
that allows

638
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,340
us at a later stage when the publisher
on income interest in

639
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:25,930
be can make too big news because

640
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:29,150
the media the media leave big love big
figures

641
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:33,360
so some resembled a nuclear energy
ministry of so done

642
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:37,330
prism they don't have such mister sir
they stole two megabytes

643
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:40,980
worth information and nothing say the so
the

644
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:44,090
the nuclear power industry yes I have

645
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:47,570
scorer said after terabytes of

646
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:52,950
data so then certainly the year so the
journalists love that kind of

647
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:58,180
figure those kinds of figures and
attracting the attention to what they do

648
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:02,980
so forces them to spend more and more so
since the change

649
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:06,410
programs to hide their activities

650
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:12,930
and to back on for them

651
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,849
so your numbers helping us us

652
00:42:15,849 --> 00:42:19,400
we love those how many terabytes of data

653
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,089
we have stone and so maybe it counts

654
00:42:23,089 --> 00:42:26,220
scores of terabytes of data helps us

655
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:29,450
to how to get good compensation

656
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:33,559
so when everyone starts praising us

657
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:37,690
so then I'll malware lasted

658
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:41,410
we we a right good mobile web picus
quality

659
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:44,589
throughout the best programming
engineers bath best

660
00:42:44,589 --> 00:42:49,309
mathematicians and I'm always the best
don't make any mistakes most

661
00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:53,319
and so we have the best encryption

662
00:42:53,319 --> 00:42:58,749
we had amassed best matters of
compression sir can I can just

663
00:42:58,749 --> 00:43:02,089
injure our algorithms just sorry

664
00:43:02,089 --> 00:43:06,910
limited to change your archiving
missions the southern

665
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:10,869
summer can just write any any passive
developer

666
00:43:10,869 --> 00:43:14,900
orchestrator some Module Manager adapter

667
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:18,059
have plugs in a into into the core

668
00:43:18,059 --> 00:43:22,109
because if you're right in the core so
then the coach should be absolutely

669
00:43:22,109 --> 00:43:25,479
immaculate that's how we are right calls

670
00:43:25,479 --> 00:43:29,119
and our modulus not crash

671
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,599
maybe once in a thousand years

672
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:37,530
happens

673
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:40,220
yes out there developing wonderful no

674
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:43,770
have to give it to him but

675
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:47,160
we hashers searchers s computer geeks

676
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:51,250
some businesses most challenging part in
our workers

677
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:55,780
every thing find it turns out to be the
most challenging

678
00:43:55,780 --> 00:44:00,690
interesting technological the perfect
and I remember trying to cram

679
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:05,440
when there were when Roy study found the
program's

680
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,530
percent now I got this is a top this is
the coolest

681
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:12,710
the coolest thing south the cold war so
wonderful so miraculous

682
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:16,240
assault human beings can do that

683
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:21,200
and then five years later service every
time so this plan goes higher and higher

684
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,000
and this is very interesting for the
analysis much more challenging

685
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,340
and then a than a Chinese have to lug X

686
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:33,090
you know continuous unexciting

687
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:36,460
stuff for and and the same time

688
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:40,370
Solr have a lot to

689
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:44,220
to pick at the dick inside the

690
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:47,750
called system and a cursory public today

691
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:52,290
in the cold because very few specialists
so can't

692
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:56,650
do such researchers because this is the
at this is the top

693
00:44:56,650 --> 00:45:01,720
her how to reverse engineering and so
certainly love to look for mistakes and

694
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,940
the same time we come across sir

695
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:09,150
a little bug in this ideal cold that
that took years to

696
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:12,940
be put together and %uh so find a small
mistake sir

697
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:17,890
which crushes the entire system a
herself for example crypto algorithms

698
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:21,370
other systems crashing on stacks so they

699
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:25,990
they found it on a bit closer on the
computers crashed so that time and froze

700
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:29,140
all the time and then it started study
hall what caused it

701
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:32,460
Anderson if these guys make a mistake to
make

702
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:37,140
huge egregious mistakes and then I have
to accept the consequences

703
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:41,550
and certainly the have the printer
problems

704
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:45,510
problems ripcord but called quality nasa
sensors

705
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:49,950
founder yeah so its military on that yes
we have in our

706
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:53,010
surveillance in our staff

707
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:56,170
so and here there's a crash is their
fault

708
00:45:56,170 --> 00:46:00,150
knows illegal migrants from space

709
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:05,810
her so they aliases their fault we don't
make in Reseda more to get into the core

710
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:09,910
the more a day be the

711
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:13,480
increased incidence of Crocker of
crashing this system

712
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:16,810
and a and then that's what exactly

713
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:20,860
we're looking for this and this we start
to dig at once

714
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:24,750
you make a mistake and can go for the
jugular

715
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:30,480
technological description system in this
state

716
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,830
so if we see the computer crashes hand
there then certainly there's something

717
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:36,570
interesting

718
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:40,620
behind if after this presentation number
of circles

719
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:44,780
so will decrease he did decreases

720
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:52,730
for this certain related to the
improvement of the quality of cold

721
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:55,300
so let me let me

722
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:58,800
draw some conclusions from prime whether
we have been

723
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,080
discussing certainly what we call

724
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:07,530
sophisticated to complexity

725
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:11,420
of any target a tech is automatically

726
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:15,420
at a medical attract our attention them
or

727
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:18,860
a a sophisticated the attackers

728
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:21,910
the higher the opportunity it's done by
the state

729
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:26,800
then them working with the kernel where
children were taught files

730
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,470
burma hardware eighties

731
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:34,620
to the the the that triggers you know
for instance

732
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:39,510
infecting their at Merkel's aid we
immediately

733
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:42,570
starter running gives us a a

734
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:45,770
it triggers our activity zero-day

735
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:50,820
attract attention that because it's
interesting its route 40 useful

736
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:56,510
and the crash of this is to move the
system

737
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:59,650
Crashers say for attract attention

738
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:02,840
so massive infections

739
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:06,820
in specific areas if we see that the
same

740
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:11,100
malware keeps attacking power companies
across the globe

741
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:15,290
immediately 8 becomes attractive

742
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:21,720
so whatever we do we just do our job we
respond

743
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:26,190
to this things that they themselves

744
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:30,650
me a give a give us a cool

745
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:34,660
they cannot work different things they
have to the rule have complicated

746
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:40,880
program software with rootkits 0 days is
a need to infect specific targets that's

747
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,460
what we use to catch them

748
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:48,010
to bait them so Eve Hui go back to the
first live to when we see that last year

749
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:49,500
we published 11

750
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:57,860
articles on research so faces the result
are froze the quick adjustment

751
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,100
so far

752
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:02,340
team to such threats we can find a quick

753
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:06,080
find it quickly and

754
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:09,680
thoroughly and probably make the world
better

755
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:15,780
and safer okay

756
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:18,830
report to my process will manage so

757
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:22,520
we still have some time for Q&A so let's

758
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:25,580
about and I want a question

759
00:49:25,580 --> 00:50:09,750
I want to vote okay scream at him

760
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:13,069
party's over to the visible know so are
you jobless as well

761
00:50:13,069 --> 00:50:19,720
just like me look

762
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:23,299
we didn't start this arms race we didn't
think was not us

763
00:50:23,299 --> 00:50:27,329
they started and this eternal

764
00:50:27,329 --> 00:50:30,369
conflict you see you first we have for

765
00:50:30,369 --> 00:50:34,480
better arms and ammunition and then we
have better shelled

766
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:40,270
better shells armor yep

767
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:43,859
I agree that me damage them

768
00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:47,430
we harm them Bay hell tomb

769
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:53,589
incur a multi-million costs but our
costs are much less per billion here

770
00:50:53,589 --> 00:51:03,099
give or take a billion here expenditures

771
00:51:03,099 --> 00:51:07,289
yes its to you contested

772
00:51:07,289 --> 00:51:10,630
how much does it cost to find in

773
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:13,940
we the moon it is pointless

774
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:17,650
so so what kind of currency are you
using

775
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:27,099
dollars have you ever thought about the
vulnerability zero-day cost on the black

776
00:51:27,099 --> 00:51:27,700
market

777
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:32,130
100 Sohus percent it's not the cost

778
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:36,369
differently but the cost probably if you
divided by three

779
00:51:36,369 --> 00:51:41,410
by to roughly rules

780
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:49,220
and indium

781
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:51,839
nothing is cheaper than any Indian guy

782
00:51:51,839 --> 00:52:07,630
an Indian developer

783
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:09,230
know we are looking for the box

784
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:13,170
its us some like mushrooms

785
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:16,310
but have they found it have the develop

786
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:20,840
the bugs so it's an open question I'm so

787
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:24,260
okay time to vote

788
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:28,230
so raise your hands for a bit early

789
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:32,950
voting is an progress so

790
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:39,560
attending yeah with the arguments you're
all mine

791
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:44,859
and the rest are working for us

792
00:52:44,859 --> 00:52:47,950
the others are working for me

793
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:53,599
yeah ship and and some people have not
decided yet

794
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:57,820
so loop the same presentation

795
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:01,859
a few days ago was made by

796
00:53:01,859 --> 00:53:05,440
our colleagues in London

797
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,530
at issue and spokes conference a small
room people
