1
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:06,939
to a situation in Russia robot

2
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:12,449
he's is so 15 for a justification the
cyst and a common criteria

3
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:17,140
assessment of potential information
system from country to readjust gone

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,390
it wasn't up to reunify

5
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:25,190
unify format old requirements

6
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:29,820
to function security functions older how
to insert work and the first

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,620
attempt to reunify methodology of
certification tests

8
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,510
dozen international

9
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,760
kitty recognition agreement framework
which

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,870
so we provide to common acceptance of
certificates and but is because of the

11
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,870
side agreement to consist up to go to
for support skill participants those who

12
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,829
had the right or producer certificates

13
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:55,510
I received in the framework of although
the CCRA activities

14
00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:00,469
and all countries except as a ouija
don't use it if it gets a

15
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:04,239
they produce it gets only for the
country's I but at the same time

16
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,619
18 unilateral Lord they receive city
because of other organizations

17
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:13,389
sometimes russia was thought to be but
just love this season will propose the

18
00:01:13,389 --> 00:01:17,899
rebel except steckel russia didn't like
that that's why

19
00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:21,569
we have on the local system or situation
that we don't accept

20
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:24,569
other city gets and they don't take are

21
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:30,729
City tickets as well formally speaking

22
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:33,380
if you would like to receive
international certificate you can come

23
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,179
chill the test lab system oxidation up

24
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:39,450
any countries participate in this
process

25
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,859
and this city if you can identify
yourself off to the poor level of trust

26
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:46,959
but just in these countries it will be
accepted by all

27
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,060
but despite all these agreement but this
is a big a lattice

28
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,259
a wildlife you can come with having
questions sir

29
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:56,770
and this additional back so but if you
let you go to the level

30
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:01,060
number three the level of trust and they
have required to the protection of the

31
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:01,899
environment to

32
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:05,369
a different environment that then they
have formal requirements which Russian

33
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:06,099
companies

34
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:11,480
on able to prevail such as a
requirements

35
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,900
to a compliance 2007 profile of
protection look up protection

36
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,940
little protection in the country where
the scheme of situations being done

37
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,450
and muscles wealthy classes including
requirements to

38
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,019
how the process of development should be

39
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:30,120
organized well

40
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,069
good would have defined that we would
like to sit by ourselves we should

41
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:34,950
select the country

42
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,049
work we will certify cells good and the

43
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:41,150
several the stumbling blocks

44
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,599
the first one the first indicator is the
but city to the sales marketing

45
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,829
for us the main initiator

46
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:54,769
Bush situation that was also the Korean
department because

47
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:58,150
but the same FAA that sounds its
commercial company

48
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,670
they were first ones who said to us that
we're ready to

49
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,989
by my special if %um city cut is so

50
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:08,640
kitchen 480 it did you think that would
be speaking about the Korean market

51
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,900
for the first couple that came to was a
South Korea test laps

52
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,870
but also been looking at Spain Turkey
the and

53
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,299
number by the country's the country's
were

54
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:23,419
it makes no sense to go to a for example

55
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:26,790
most of the the means of protection are

56
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,769
sex but in Canada Canadian frazier laps
they will not even talk to you

57
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:34,680
they just that's what they say

58
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,400
and in every country they have there are
the classiest South Korea laboratory

59
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,549
will begin to them

60
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:45,269
that they had three meetings with three
test laboratory Selda

61
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:49,919
there are racing became wide open when
they hear that this is a Russian company

62
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,470
and they start saying

63
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:56,940
they don't see no little teen basie
whether we don't have English speak Kane

64
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:02,010
a specially said we cannot take do this
as a limitation which

65
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,889
is not written green language some say
that they are too overloaded with

66
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:09,230
projects and they are not rated
undertaken and from the conversation can

67
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:15,170
see that they don't have any desire to
deal with Russian company

68
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:19,239
want to get a number of countries like
Italy for example

69
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:24,830
they say that well we're ready to ship
such a fine you but if your product

70
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,060
we'll comply to certain local

71
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,419
relations and when the stellar fears

72
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:34,990
because certificate for compliance to
the same level of trust gives a ride

73
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,360
to cell certified

74
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,500
programs a 20 the budget authority if
things that

75
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,080
innately they don't have to know it's
like our bodies over 280

76
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:51,550
you are greatly stake well the whole

77
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,830
first yeah both it was communications
with the

78
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,849
death love so we have stopped on the
site and once again the first meeting

79
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:04,080
would be a sight was Journal analogy of
stack the first meeting with them was

80
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,120
that yes nor formal

81
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,650
block set top box ep your vacation but
as a result

82
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:14,229
p took a personal day here to it make
the decision and not

83
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:17,919
only the federal in industry but the in
store for the first also participate in

84
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,490
the decision in federal police

85
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:23,030
because it's there knowledge of are to
the Federal Security Service

86
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,330
so before we got approval of

87
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,539
although certain stations are between
this transitions they didn't accept

88
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:33,930
partition

89
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,360
asked the obligation was officially
accepted

90
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,500
the workshop was started

91
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,370
then where phase the phase difference
between jordan skips education from

92
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,240
Russian

93
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,139
its there is street position at work

94
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:52,190
have if you play here rusher you apply

95
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:56,520
two steaks take a book that application
then use that situation

96
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,789
and then afterwards communication with
federal authorities you should forget

97
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:01,330
about it

98
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,770
it's their problem on the test labs and
the situation much but enjoy Lindsay for

99
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:06,010
an

100
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:09,350
Germany have applied to it has been a
protest love starts working at the first

101
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,000
thing they do

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,169
you agree dick a little clout over
operations not only with the test

103
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:17,760
lab but also the federal agency because
we're a job creation like that kato

104
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,330
agency

105
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,500
express their own expert which assesses
or early stages of the assessment

106
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,610
and shit to forget that they have fairy
pick your people and it's a crisis

107
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,919
budget is being cut

108
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,180
specialists have been laid off so
specialist has a lot of pressures

109
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,610
so they conder time in time slots to
whisper document

110
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:38,760
therefore eat you are not able to give
doesn't for expertise

111
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,810
indecent two-week time slot well you
have to wait for the next

112
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,650
time slot in order to look at your
document

113
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:51,159
in Russia unit will be you label be able
to see something like that

114
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:54,460
so what we need for the second
assessment

115
00:06:54,460 --> 00:07:02,290
wrong in order to receive the city for
the second level of trust

116
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:06,210
well the assessment level of trust
number two with the new level

117
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:10,150
under which the test level or something
about the internals

118
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:13,640
but rather the most important thing the
most important document as usual provide

119
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,280
is the security documents which
describes requirements and brief

120
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,000
description

121
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,490
of how do provide a protection in the
city by product

122
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:28,990
also small

123
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,770
top-level project location: functional
specifications and a

124
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:37,430
something that can be translated as
project but they call it

125
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,430
designed of product or

126
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:45,450
architecture it sufficient condition and

127
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:48,610
a standard user manual also which is
nothing

128
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:54,270
special the security at Target

129
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:59,250
requirements to it are legit for it from
Russian to English once a

130
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:03,000
24 months but I said the crisis in
russia if you set a byproduct

131
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,190
was all for the complex optical
specifications and a

132
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,800
I'm not going to show distinct speak
issues to the class because they are

133
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,930
defined to pass this education and not
to demonstrate functions of security of

134
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:14,530
the product

135
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,820
in the framework of the show right
solved all the different

136
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,580
you'll have to show to the quite not
only is it typical but also

137
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,730
the security target and reports of
situations but that's why

138
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:29,710
what the procedure situation is needed
so that line lot only with a country

139
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,830
that somebody

140
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:35,060
have tested their their software but
also made sure what was the main a deal

141
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,310
for these test and what it was tested
for

142
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,680
after the completion of the procedure
situation the objective on security at

143
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,740
Target and the reports and situation
I've been published in two places the

144
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,050
first one comes to Chipotle don't work

145
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:51,460
which is essential for 20 all these
international syndication

146
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,550
close in other countries like Germany
the same documents have been published

147
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,060
in the site of a dog

148
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:01,120
body which was done this the
certification it gives a

149
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,740
me a certain simplicity to the work for
the school prepares the workforce

150
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,730
education because

151
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,980
the objective the target should not be

152
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,120
but on the portal you have to select
security at Target for similar products

153
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,470
you look at which one is closer to your
brother

154
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,770
any have to change modify the
requirements and change the department

155
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:19,530
we the

156
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:23,870
the functions on this cruise at the bar
just goes up because I just wasn't

157
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,970
German test lab the criticizes the

158
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:31,060
those which are written by the Canadian
laps Canadian Manufacturers & said by

159
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,450
the

160
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:36,720
Canadian love because it well its does
not comply to the concrete Syria

161
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,740
and a point by their fingers and it does
not comply

162
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,600
truly resolve their differences on how
people assess

163
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,810
the assessment of dependencies some
things which in normal development don't

164
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:50,590
really know this damn

165
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,660
11 working in the brush in system
certification course a five years

166
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,830
include the assessment of he saw

167
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:02,200
efficient for aged and I don't know all
this because that is even today

168
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,470
because it's very unusual for the IT guy
to de Gea to such things

169
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:11,780
well the first thing that the European
required blend you

170
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,680
come to provide the project location for
the product is a scheme

171
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,790
love divided this probably was into
subsystems and

172
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:22,940
detailed a description of the interphase
of cooperation between two seasons

173
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:28,230
well briefly I'm going to tell you about
this task this was speaking

174
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,360
developers should tell them well look

175
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,240
wet weather consists of this marshals
loss it has a operating system

176
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,710
and database operating system and that
his don't touch it because a

177
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:42,140
we are not its fine them but we certify
that the space is a byproduct

178
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,200
the first thing that you will face here
is the fact that

179
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,640
a geology of the country serious issues
data

180
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,570
with the development well general saddam
formally first-year design

181
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,890
for Wii subsistence your sis will
consist then you have designed how this

182
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:56,840
%uh system is divided

183
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,980
its morsels any formal is why I washed
spoke operate with one another and then

184
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,950
develop a stutter jumping on the bed

185
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,400
well it's understandable to everyone
that in reality it never happens like

186
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:06,830
that

187
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:10,490
because the product that has been
developed in the course of Telenor yes

188
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:16,540
it's a constant iteration process and
the idea that you had in the beginning

189
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,560
88 doesn't work right now and

190
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,040
right now everything has been changed so
the first thing that you do is if you

191
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,410
see that detailee you look at your truck
and NEC

192
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:28,709
well let's call the subsystem reporting
and the

193
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:31,879
let's go substitute of scanning and this
will be called for the

194
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:35,110
done to be some knowledge distracted by
schemes show with a

195
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,149
information exchange between the systems
and

196
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:42,009
give it up for a situation and then pray
that this will be accepted and nobody

197
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:42,889
will ask you more

198
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:48,319
detailed questions about car does this
look in reality well

199
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:51,439
what is

200
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:57,529
required from 2.2 your project week
documentation formally

201
00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:02,529
in the specific issue conclude any
requirements to this cutie you

202
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:05,670
containing from the same part of the
country to its a couple complete

203
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:09,100
requirements with certain rules which
allow you to change

204
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,850
and modify the sick ones plus you in the

205
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,570
compliance with certain principles you
can formulate a

206
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:20,100
open the requirements for the front but
there's a certain set the brick ones

207
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,060
with you has included two brothers even
though formally there is not such a good

208
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:24,680
one but

209
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,450
they will make you do that the most
important thing

210
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:33,720
we should be available to you should
justify to the set of requirements that

211
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,590
you have provided to the meet these
requirements have been faulted that

212
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,870
protection of the product cannot be
avoided

213
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:44,740
and when you speak about to availability
of the means of protection and a look at

214
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,770
certain limited to set of attacks

215
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:50,210
attacks related to waste force brute
force

216
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:57,040
brute force facing protocol to Texas and
this is also complexity of the

217
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,240
mechanisms of dividing the authority so
that would be

218
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,840
impossible to violate access rights or
get around certain

219
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,870
the access rights checks and absence of

220
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:13,290
errors of the ball for overflow whose
use issue would be

221
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:16,780
give the possibility it to a discover
the logical the problem operation

222
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:20,640
and when you read the general assessment
methodology and you see smart one so

223
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,050
much

224
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,600
how everything should be operated and
well described

225
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,710
indication it looks awful Young said
that you have to write a lot of papers

226
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,860
with a more to love by later someone
love threats but given the

227
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:36,090
progeny patient was written but company
because we ourselves would be able to do

228
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,690
it for the first time but in reality
show the justifications

229
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,820
takes have a peach of writing he gets

230
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:46,530
look there is no ways around it if you
have properly build a real policy so

231
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,960
there by later level possible to get
around it

232
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,230
and do any critical operation it's not
as awful as it might seem

233
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:56,740
if you have that this situation worse
then you'll be able and you all can use

234
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,170
is that was as templates

235
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,370
for writing a presentation other
products

236
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:06,510
functional specification it's the worst
argument that we have a face and

237
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,080
development took a six months

238
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,870
I'll so it was that we've been involved
in this project arts education the

239
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,209
product so bloody east to be

240
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:19,920
the actually done to digitalization of
the architecture down to the level of a

241
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,079
two-phase scription

242
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:24,970
while was unaware injure face of
cooperation between

243
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:29,029
scanning must well colonel and a basal

244
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:36,999
in order to satisfy the interface one
needs to while it's still

245
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:40,790
provide detailed description which
protocol you communicate this canning

246
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:44,429
couldn't wait database in which one is
the access objects

247
00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:48,220
who is this subject so these access
rights which operations are being done

248
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,970
which were also for distribution of the
access rights are being

249
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:55,369
followed everything should be described
in the agreed to jail

250
00:14:55,369 --> 00:15:01,480
and EF well it's good if you use
standard protocols then you can

251
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,749
easily give assessments that got
documents which describe this product

252
00:15:04,749 --> 00:15:05,389
RFC

253
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:09,929
or degradation for the

254
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:14,399
developer this problem or so if you
realize you protocol destroy Nicole

255
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,990
has to be specified you you have to
write your specification which describes

256
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:19,309
all

257
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:24,799
this wilder like you and the we have not
been this Windows products we have used

258
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,569
already predefined the level it
decisions really i won

259
00:15:28,569 --> 00:15:32,439
or the single interfaces the interests
of communication with operating system

260
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:39,560
well Jessica

261
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,930
stumbling block that way often faces the
procedure of

262
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:46,250
agent addition authentication when these
procedures are being written separately

263
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,939
but more like it we have been using the
procedural vote indication realize

264
00:15:49,939 --> 00:15:54,290
in operating system a how usually
certification loosens

265
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:59,370
brother fuser just bus was for this post
what it has tickets been calculated has

266
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,420
been compared to

267
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,560
hash which is being stored in the
database us all

268
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,920
as the test lab he is that what has
because question they ask you

269
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,579
what cryptography which one you to use
if you use cryptography oh the operating

270
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:12,709
system well as normal

271
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:16,839
heap you right if hashing function
yourself

272
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:20,000
well same we look in Russia you face a
requirement that

273
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,750
your reaction function should comply to
the its journal

274
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,069
standards they have in Germany

275
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:32,310
his hip 140 basically speaking jazz due
to the fact that your use your

276
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:35,759
all his shit function in addition to is
a fifteen

277
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,360
if 50 a justification you also should
satisfy your cryptographic module

278
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,220
it's it's it's a traditional of
cryptographic module in Germany

279
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,670
is not less complex than certification
in the air SB in Russia

280
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,740
so in our case we hat

281
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:56,269
to gold through all our problems in
order to find out so that we don't write

282
00:16:56,269 --> 00:16:59,639
all ishibashi and we have used only
operating system functions

283
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:04,390
well

284
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,590
level to these Asian is a very high bomb

285
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:12,150
and the in a tragedy condition where
face the fact that

286
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:17,960
it's insufficient just to described it
you have these interface in the east 15

287
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,300
for way to a you have very GE for

288
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,050
was for cation dean for interfaces
interface plus

289
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:30,290
a while has these its interface which
has these properties and the size 82

290
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:34,070
interface and the project depends and I
don't know what is difference between

291
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,810
them

292
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:38,790
and all the work was done for us by the
consulting company

293
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:44,220
and I do hold in the future we will just
follow the

294
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,410
similar pathway because products are
built on this

295
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,910
architectural well therefore

296
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:55,750
in order to

297
00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:03,060
be assessed at the Pride be certified
you have to just right into great detail

298
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,320
make these of control asses accessing
your problem

299
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,500
and are stumbling blocks that you have
to overcome as well

300
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:16,650
have told you in the project in addition
you have to justify

301
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:21,050
the possibility of getting rowdy
mechanism of security 10 the directions

302
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,050
of getting rounded

303
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:25,740
is the access limitations

304
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:30,660
function it didn't say properly able but
there's a requirement which is followed

305
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,020
by

306
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:35,850
all schemes up situation that hi pace
hey guys please write good role model

307
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:39,250
you have the setup roles and operations

308
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,720
bleach can be executed over the axis
objects and

309
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,000
basically speaking mechanisms of

310
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,530
principal I'll give you those roles to
the use as well we understand the set up

311
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,800
rules and in operations we can see for
example

312
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,930
that a bad roles terminations oh well

313
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:02,650
force and the role of creating in the
payment obligations out creating

314
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:05,880
to offer people and approval of payment

315
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,440
these roles I look at people and
applying them to other levels

316
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,990
of separated SS well it might be
applicable and

317
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:15,470
test labs they can work with role

318
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:19,179
if in your product here discrimination
model where the user can

319
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:22,679
the user work creating the

320
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:28,720
algae he can use the any settles a bust
other bottle there's no brady models of

321
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,649
assessment is a

322
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:33,370
dropper or improper distribution role so
you have to

323
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:36,890
generous your system rules you show it
to the test

324
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,970
lap the CA guys know there's a pretty
sweet deal

325
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,760
these these in these defined it you for
example have this set up rules and this

326
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,130
is a row of operator

327
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:48,490
and they said the rules it's the ball
let's say Belichick's

328
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:52,970
who looks at the report said define
please wish rights issue

329
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:56,370
complex which roles have included into
the user documentation

330
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,620
and then you will sing that this
limitation for use show your pride

331
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:03,220
you respectively to end discrimination
policy or boxes rights

332
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,950
where you can do whatever you want to do
the company which uses sits right

333
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:09,019
product will be obliged

334
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:12,610
to follow the Citizen requirements and
lock

335
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:17,240
been able making step to the right step
2 forever: to them and with following

336
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,490
these conditions test lab israelis to
the assessment

337
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,840
and the situation that will agree with
this assessment

338
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,860
well

339
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,510
after all these has been described a
level on the interface then you write

340
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,580
names documents a more detailed the

341
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:37,039
description a position project at the
top level or specification

342
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,519
a design well we'll see

343
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:45,100
have to forced in Test Lab all the
details of the

344
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,399
trouble the rescues or the same

345
00:20:48,399 --> 00:20:51,950
fertile specifications that I was field

346
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:56,570
interface description down to the API
functions

347
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:00,120
action by the minute well festival so
the test lab

348
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,769
will be able to the be sure that
everything that he's been defined

349
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:07,990
drugs been for field then there's
another the rations in mexico situation

350
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,279
is

351
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:12,630
independent search availability new
software products

352
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:15,049
which has to be done by the test luck

353
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:18,909
so this came up databases and the API
said specifications for the course is

354
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:19,360
needed

355
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,809
so that it just facing for the course is
being done in the blade boast more

356
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:26,320
in order to establish parameters were
the book for floor habits and et cetera

357
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,029
et cetera

358
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:30,509
so all these has to be described and
Scholl

359
00:21:30,509 --> 00:21:33,710
to the management of test up

360
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:37,519
therefore a few users

361
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:40,559
open source products you have to give

362
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:45,289
addition to this product's well but the
condition and that's what you have

363
00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:50,049
the school would be a URL link to this
active developer

364
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:55,190
or are they just cry the head of

365
00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:00,419
functions of the product description
menus this could be anything else

366
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:03,700
but information should be available
course well

367
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,730
Eve social washer was written by you

368
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:11,499
then you have to write this persecution
alone because

369
00:22:11,499 --> 00:22:14,669
the does not were elsewhere can take
this

370
00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:18,169
information because it's another
stumbling block because which library

371
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:18,989
can be

372
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:22,389
the written ten years ago and developer
who was writing ten years ago

373
00:22:22,389 --> 00:22:27,590
the but he was he left the company you
have to reverse this library

374
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:31,279
and the in reverse cycle you have to
write a header

375
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:35,340
file included into the condition
difficult

376
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,989
long time but you have to do it but does
it shake which is recommended by the

377
00:22:38,989 --> 00:22:42,359
test loves itself hey guys if u don't
know this library was being

378
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:46,149
tell us that this is not part of your
private it's the opposite talking about

379
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:48,070
it it doesn't it

380
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:51,450
suPAR of your product nobody cares about
it so they've

381
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:56,659
a Bowl assessment is beale to in the
parking lot well they play here and we

382
00:22:56,659 --> 00:22:58,759
don't play it because this is not us

383
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:02,389
and this is a legal tree kids defiant by
is so

384
00:23:02,389 --> 00:23:05,440
fitted for each other everybody Greece's
due to the absence

385
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,639
of other options so the level it is
asians really high one insufficiently

386
00:23:11,639 --> 00:23:14,489
just describe what calls the sponsors
what you have to

387
00:23:14,489 --> 00:23:19,529
described the diagram of sequence how
these operations are being executed

388
00:23:19,529 --> 00:23:23,499
whose week 17 announced in the objection
security

389
00:23:23,499 --> 00:23:27,299
all the way to the sequential call the
function

390
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:30,909
stated in this course is being
transferred fortunately these

391
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:34,129
is to be done only for those four-ship
functions for some if we have a

392
00:23:34,129 --> 00:23:34,869
requirement

393
00:23:34,869 --> 00:23:41,059
to notification well known for those
four functions which

394
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:44,509
are called doing the check the password

395
00:23:44,509 --> 00:23:52,499
use talk much fortune to to %ah so we
have very good talk management

396
00:23:52,499 --> 00:23:56,600
and we need

397
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,820
three things actually the user manual
description of the interface some all

398
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,739
the operations

399
00:24:01,739 --> 00:24:06,309
which are related to your use show the
security approaching the product and the

400
00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:07,489
skin bball

401
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:11,190
PDF document or can be you or euro file

402
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:15,159
is built into the program bottled water
except the second one is the

403
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:16,210
installation menu

404
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:20,019
well

405
00:24:20,019 --> 00:24:24,899
official for the most of the

406
00:24:24,899 --> 00:24:28,580
social project key you can install it
with a certain

407
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,970
said options had this

408
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:37,960
auctions you can play with but once its
byproducts

409
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,369
in stock you should guarantee and you'll

410
00:24:42,369 --> 00:24:45,379
need all the instructions which you need
it for the correct functioning all

411
00:24:45,379 --> 00:24:52,059
the certified objective therefore in
addition to the fact that you have

412
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:55,720
installation manual you need additional
document

413
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,399
but Emanuel hey guys you should know if
you use certified

414
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:04,489
version then you have to for the
sorption de ser

415
00:25:04,489 --> 00:25:09,350
or this week yes it is able this war
jewel or at additional software or to do

416
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,309
additional

417
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:13,409
preset in a configuration file that's
why

418
00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:17,470
the when we do the situation a all the
settings are being

419
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:20,730
reproduced and you obviously

420
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:27,899
or we forgot to switch something I'll it
doesn't work anymore

421
00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:29,429
the setting so well

422
00:25:29,429 --> 00:25:35,689
fixed plus the third thing

423
00:25:35,689 --> 00:25:39,849
which is required to use two describe
the procedure of delivering

424
00:25:39,849 --> 00:25:43,049
the product to the closed session ways
so

425
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:46,549
to the client or you have it in you
really probably and

426
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:52,039
mail for this product your client should
be convinced in the usability of this

427
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:53,199
product was the issue

428
00:25:53,199 --> 00:25:56,489
shape that he received a necessary
version

429
00:25:56,489 --> 00:25:59,609
Deschutes River the control has tax and
ID numbers

430
00:25:59,609 --> 00:26:02,759
that were given and shown the interface
and the same things

431
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:07,159
way to the top management there

432
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:11,079
it should that the client receives an
archive which has been included

433
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:15,699
is wearing clothes to and that she is a
potential

434
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,859
some the use a million his control some

435
00:26:18,859 --> 00:26:22,099
special settings after installation
here's a control hash

436
00:26:22,099 --> 00:26:25,979
some is described as a document that
then it's been including to the petition

437
00:26:25,979 --> 00:26:31,200
for the desk

438
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,570
the most unexpected thing that we have
faced cells

439
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:38,010
St representation of the testing
condition presenting to the

440
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:41,559
management say consistent level of
Trustees different for the trust

441
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:46,200
just how is that the developer should
provide have the full set of tests which

442
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,620
dog quite show that s not the reason the

443
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,950
testing lab does this lecture a check
but this

444
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:56,620
so I'll shoot it well dismissal so have

445
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:00,100
well for each function you have doses
hundreds of cats

446
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:05,919
something done automatically some other
are down menu Bob testicular

447
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:10,240
station is done Russell english words
and to translate

448
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,020
although cease all this tree of tests
English

449
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:20,710
it's a very well it's not difficult for
many ways but it's a

450
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:25,900
stitches from 2004 time it's not
acceptable so when we get to go up

451
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:29,540
what should be doing this case they look
at us they look at our testing

452
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:34,940
Lokpal elicit what we do need full
disintegration for you but lots or

453
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:39,110
all lots of all detail Weiss so as a
result

454
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:44,809
his old dealt will you follow the same
way like

455
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:48,049
Russian test labs doing we have a rate
not

456
00:27:48,049 --> 00:27:52,160
fake certain from senator dole just
debts

457
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:56,760
demonstrate workability of other
interface accessible to the internist

458
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,820
in we do testing and we have described
the

459
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:06,130
chests and tears we don't doesn't like
every functions been tested

460
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:09,890
by ten different tests but this was also

461
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:13,960
will put it to the laboratory that
Medical Center they said well you see

462
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,750
the bus what other four digits and using
sensor

463

the station will also do

00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,600
and depth transition justification

466
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:37,710
is required to a step-by-step basis you
have to check mark here

467
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:41,200
you know it's just text here you have
pressed this but you and other

468
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,740
output you should see this picture that
tension in that caller this is the

469
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,220
information that tester

470
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,660
shoot she in order to achieve good just

471
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:53,130
yes analysis the liabilities what is
done by the

472
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:57,110
test lab it's for the second assessment
level

473
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:02,990
is a test by the black box massive test
lab has loss or schools

474
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:06,290
they are provided only by the force says
the

said bro which take until and can do
whatever he wants with his brother where

00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:11,270
he gets

477
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:16,460
and by way Russian or Western test loves

478
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:20,860
love them will declare block really

479
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,080
how really discover

480
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:30,960
other villages in certified programs but
those who know a comment you know that

481
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,010
are those operations are key a function
as are

482
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:38,020
products also been the voice bias
handbook with the use

483
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:41,549
of our hands hikers and helpful for all

484
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:46,940
low self protection projects but I've at
this was a family did have some problem

485
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:50,110
what if Jones to have south-central

486
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:56,340
polish that way me Steve they will where
is your day will include some dental

487
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:59,520
not be able to restore our reputation
will be destroyed

488
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,040
for beginning but way were able to see
other testing has been done

489
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:07,390
I'll bet that this is set for all
doesn't they've been doing its

490
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:10,130
phasing also black box

491
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:14,300
what protocol they were not able to
discover some destroyed a course

492
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,550
but they clinical to see it

493
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:21,700
up all the relations functions the
certain

494
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:26,150
for runners the entrance with less
Twitter in the special Thomas and then

495
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,360
we'll see what happens

496
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,600
samples and then we'll do a social world

497
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:34,170
British just local DC diabetes

498
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:37,810
were whether this sub for more shoulder

499
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:40,950
is being used by us well with Jean

500
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:46,090
of small problem but that the release
will fix the problem does

501
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:49,610
cool have a stop-loss partial and was
checking total pushing for the most

502
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:50,020

position apostle there's an over to sell
ivory

504
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,940
the Jets blitzer and will not be able to
deny this leverage because its use for

505
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,440
scanning

506
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,720
certain and ship hull worse so we have
to use Boehner both version

507
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,400
fortunately choice positions function

508
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,430

into delivery by the strong all 6's its
allies

510

511
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,670
with well-known which is well

512
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:26,010
but if out of everything they have
children told you previously

513
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:30,530
and what we have learned about the
analyses of religions they do a person

514
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:33,540
30 percent what we deal with opposes

516
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:43,230
the result of Education is it report
certification

517
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:47,019
penitential the process lose the phone
with your just what doctors Tesla

518
00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:51,370
test for the stock has made a report
next document

519
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:57,220
Assessment Report ish assessment report
he's been tested by situation but 280

520
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:00,440
the why BSI expert

521
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,570
writes these 50 to 60 page document

522
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:08,279
reporters occasion likely be checking
the star

523
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:11,500
herself but the check is such
limitations were sessions such

524
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,639
result positive otherwise

525
00:32:15,639 --> 00:32:19,010
there will be no reports education and
what the situation becomes an integral

526
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:22,200
part 26 byproduct well given to certify
to

527
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,620
version of the product you have to give
him this certificate a

528
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:32,730
situated not and report action I

529
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:36,320
don't know ha on the situation schemes
are watching but right now we're working

530
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,289
with Spanish came by the way the world
works

531
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:41,710
investigation but in jordan's King
exhibition as soon as you passed

532
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,510
all the steps you also have the chance
to see this

533
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:49,019
it and they are longer to give it to you
before you will take several occasions

534
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:50,429
is this a lovely gay show

535
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:55,330
to provide I always full set of search
for documents

536
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:58,460
serve beer sell of the

537
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,929
is carefully looking at the fact that

538
00:33:01,929 --> 00:33:05,070
trademark of jaundice I will be used for

539
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:08,769
bad marketing in other words

540
00:33:08,769 --> 00:33:15,559
they want to make sure day precious so
this truck has all the information about

541
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:16,659
the security function

542
00:33:16,659 --> 00:33:20,330
and its realization and in the security
or

543
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:24,059
there's a very rates to Shin of all the
limitations

544
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:28,010
albeit polish it consists

545
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:32,659
description of

546
00:33:32,659 --> 00:33:35,309
limitations that they have to face it
the fact is that

547
00:33:35,309 --> 00:33:39,149
sometimes whipped cation for rice

548
00:33:39,149 --> 00:33:47,379
48 while use product which clients over
relations is up to the HTTP on protocol

549
00:33:47,379 --> 00:33:52,299
due to sudden ideas you cannot use in
Corning so that you wouldn't lose

550
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:56,249
for you cannot use SSL so you don't go
to certification offer

551
00:33:56,249 --> 00:33:59,749
cryptographic modules so what

552
00:33:59,749 --> 00:34:04,719
they develop us he said the following:
set let's use HTTP indeed and we will

553
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:09,020
write in the condition that the product
can be used only in isolated network no

554
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,079
remote access

555
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:15,490
is defined in security call then
certifications Don city to get his give

556
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:16,579
this limitation

557
00:34:16,579 --> 00:34:21,779
them they sell trucks and security a
document

558
00:34:21,779 --> 00:34:25,329
a and client does not buy this
litigation he will serve the product

559
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:26,609
tests & Conditions

560
00:34:26,609 --> 00:34:31,520
and they're not situation data are pass
to the open protocol to the entire

561
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,960
in order for this not to happen this I
it requires a all

562
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:40,869
the plantation security here report
situation report which it serves

563
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:44,770
all the conditions to be provided to the
client

564
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:47,899
publish the site of developer and E has
to be

565
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:50,960
transferred and described in the manual

566
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,010
on delivery of the product he

567
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:59,529
if you will try to hide and removed from
the site

568
00:34:59,529 --> 00:35:02,700
these documents the SES

569
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,869
formal a certificate recall

570
00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:14,410
reason

571
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:16,270
well making the regime out of

572
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:20,060
the box set well as mean difference of
the western city officials cues from

573
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:20,820
Russian one

574
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:24,240
well priced clear there's no difference
brief within see principal difference

575
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,970
except for some peculiarities that

576
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:29,330
I've been telling you about I

577
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:34,840
would like to approach its Russian
portion well iteration what

578
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,610
is this iterations about we have reading
the project indication that we get to

579
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:39,740
the assessment at them

580
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:42,900
decade spent doesn't not complex

581
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:47,850
once it was a returned to us with the
knowledge then was sent the next version

582
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:48,390
then

583
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:52,470
best says they'll find other problems
and this process will be to rate it

584
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:55,860
until we will bring this document to the
ideal condition

585
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,710
so there is no situation that or your
doctor doesn't look like a boy

586
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:02,869
no labeled and communications we'd

587
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:07,230
you communicate with a test love and war
and was fishing boats as well

588
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:10,790
this medication is that well you can
write a letter to your email

589
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:14,390
there were lots but did open this week
occasion I really like

590
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:18,910
because some questions they have sold
directly

591
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:24,380
equalization for example I'll

592
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,859
stop this we'd like

593
00:36:27,859 --> 00:36:31,619
the Rick wants to the debts owed it to
exist because in russian situation

594
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:35,100
you can submit presentation more

595
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,500
general says less detailed

596
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,890
but I like that the deadlines

597
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:45,470
a and cost the deadlines one year for
tuition

598
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:49,619
one here for decision making is to watch
because of certification world three

599
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:50,600
times higher

600
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,450
then CEO's cation Russian issue

601
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:57,900
well we didn't like liking Russian one
we know that it's inevitable that

602
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,930
station versions for example we have

603
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:04,920
submit for one or the Russian evil like
he

604
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,210
this will be a running one more year by
the situation has

605
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:15,410
doing this cation the previous version
has already been outdated by the climb

606
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:18,550
has to be yours the has to use of person
or

607
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:21,770
he bought 65 version but

608
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:26,890
early here's the real one there also
within like the work of pasta brushes to

609
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,680
get those various doses of April

610
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,690
has brought by now I've noticed paper
going back to the opens

611
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:36,000
of certification well this real problem
waco

612
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,700
documents that they see but those given
well the problem was sold very quickly

613
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:46,530
have been writing a letter to the is bio
situation say what can be done

614
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:49,760
say well this morning Friday

615
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,900
placenta and today finally I see the
sorry for
