1
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:07,290
I will

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,370
ok unlivable all my life

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,259
my technical knowledge show Russian

4
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:17,890
use

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:18,970
about

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,560
0 so continue in English I was going we
were difficult

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,750
thanks we are going to

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,010
speaker faults doing a cyber fortress

9
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:35,559
and I'll during a cyber fortress

10
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:38,580
is very difference

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,950
from mom doing you know our regular
fortunes

12
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:46,300
you know because a regular fortress has
has walls

13
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,410
and the side of the fortress

14
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:55,269
is supposed to be safe due to be safe

15
00:00:55,269 --> 00:00:58,920
you don't need to protect anything
inside the fortress

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,909
are like the people and the goods

17
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:07,050
you only care about the walls you care
about the dollars

18
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,650
so boys basically looks like this

19
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:16,060
you have cover

20
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,590
very visible perimeter and has been

21
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,340
the case for at least I'll twenty years

22
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,960
we've been living in this paradigm
meeting

23
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:34,130
a perimeter security and some people are
still

24
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,490
still living in this paradigm I've had
discussions even here

25
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,140
with are several people and

26
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,070
I'll this do you believe perimeter
security is important

27
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,439
which is not really the case

28
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:51,710
arm in his old paradigm

29
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:56,329
you have several layers security you
have far

30
00:01:56,329 --> 00:02:00,200
the altar layer which is your gateway in
your firewall far

31
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,210
controls and the inner layer

32
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,280
is your most important asset usually
does

33
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,899
date and I am

34
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:15,640
with the current attacks this is changed
it has changed because

35
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,770
no what is being attacked right now

36
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:22,120
is not your perimeter mostly

37
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,270
it is your endpoint and

38
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,220
I in order to protect

39
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,590
the day do you need to protect the
endpoint beats

40
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,360
are even if the endpoint is the Smart
Form

41
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,520
or are for a tablet's or are

42
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,720
laptop or a computer or server doesn't
matter

43
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,350
you're in point is what you need to
protect and

44
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,730
since is very difficult to visualize
what a cyber fortresses

45
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,120
because powers your the fortress is what
you see on the screen

46
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,390
I've asked our friend of mine who is so

47
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,700
an artist to create this are

48
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,500
this disbanding is abstract painting

49
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,930
and as you can see their no holds

50
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:12,720
and there is no wall anywhere

51
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,770
everything is connected to everything
and you need to know

52
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:23,010
to protects everything in sight there
are no LTE switcher compromised

53
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:27,310
on this picture they are brown and their
isolated they're not connecting to

54
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,140
anything else

55
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:33,430
are thats at least that's my view of our
cyber fortress

56
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,680
and explain

57
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,600
how to protect the endpoints you in just
a few minutes

58
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,320
in the arm in the old

59
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,110
in the old paradigm into in the idea of
arm

60
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:52,120
a normal fortress in order to breach

61
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,730
the security you have to invest a
significant level of

62
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,010
resource you had to invest at least

63
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:03,239
three times the manpower tool

64
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,500
to breach the wall today

65
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,870
even a single guy somewhere across the
globe can

66
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,940
I'll can penetrate your defenses with
your cheap exploit

67
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,560
get all your data get on a vid

68
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,410
go down develop your perimeter without
even noticing

69
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,590
solar prices changed and what we need to
do

70
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,620
is I'll we need to increase

71
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,520
significantly they've price of
exploitation to increase the price

72
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,669
effect with nation

73
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:39,500
we have to protect the molds in a way

74
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,710
which is

75
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,550
non-standard non I mean you cannot rely
on

76
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,600
anti-virus I'm sure all you know that

77
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,620
and it's very difficult to rely on

78
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,320
intrusion detection systems because the
only look for patterns which are known

79
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,320
are heuristics an anomaly detection

80
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,460
unfortunately he is still not ready and
arm

81
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,190
in this case we need to harden the
system's

82
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:13,850
in in unconventional ways this
presentation

83
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:17,210
is focused only in that arm

84
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:20,800
you know who is attacking us according
to the media

85
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,270
its its Datt right

86
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,430
and I bT has been

87
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,050
I'll in every single marketing material

88
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,020
in every single device which is being
sold right now

89
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,270
every single appliance the advertise

90
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,630
the ability to detect and protect
against a bit

91
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:47,000
well the problem is you cannot really
protect against deputies

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,110
I mean your

93
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,789
to protect against the peace you need to
decrease

94
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:57,470
their motivation you need to login to
relive their motivation

95
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,820
and maybe he's not alone is not our

96
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:05,699
technology which are protected for you
are basically protecting from the sniper

97
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,220
and to protect from the sniper its best

98
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,120
is best to get out of the way the rifle

99
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,139
or become invisible to the sniper or

100
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:21,210
grow shell which is so difficult to
penetrate

101
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,620
the sniper with not shoot because he
knows

102
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:29,180
cannot get through and the

103
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,310
for thats you need to become

104
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,030
I'll I'm advanced resistant defender

105
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:41,289
AB de which is a new term arm

106
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:45,750
to become an advanced persistent
defender standard

107
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,380
standard learning is not enough and

108
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,630
standard education which you getting the
university's definitely not enough

109
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:57,479
because big ice you're fighting against

110
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:01,430
our people whole educate themselves then
nights

111
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,500
the share knowledge then nights

112
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,139
the based are the new techniques all the
time

113
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:12,070
and I'll they didn't learn that in the
University

114
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:15,639
in order to become and advanced
persistent defender

115
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:19,820
you to act in the same way and you need

116
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,599
to learn different kind of knowledge

117
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,860
from what you can get from mom

118
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:32,620
from study books

119
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,680
right so this is the foundation

120
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,570
the foundation adjust several books a
few books

121
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:42,690
which I recommends ritual laid a
foundation

122
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,450
have your are have your growing

123
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,980
as advanced persistent offenders a few

124
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,920
being able to build a cyber fortress you
needs

125
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:58,830
some strategy knowledge and the strategy
known as she's your

126
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:02,430
base even though it's not big nickel

127
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:07,070
even though it's not I'll it's not fancy

128
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:11,170
but it's your base without the base it
will be very very difficult to build on

129
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,650
Sol the art of war

130
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:18,330
many of you have heard about the art of
war it is

131
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:22,080
laying the foundation of making nom

132
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,840
a proper balance of power up knowing
when to attack

133
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,030
when tool defendant went to flee

134
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:33,880
how to build your defenses the art of
war has been known

135
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,220
a across the hacker community for
probably

136
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,750
twenty thirty years very well-known
ardor

137
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,890
the to boots following after have not
been

138
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,940
sewn on arm the art of warfare

139
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,770
by arm some say

140
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:56,150
ground some of Sunzu which

141
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:01,240
is not definite because he might have
lived several hundred years after

142
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,340
our son so is also very good book

143
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:10,450
and they are the book of five rings is a
Japanese one old the art of war and the

144
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,460
art of warfare

145
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,840
are two books which are written by are
Chinese

146
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,420
generals and our book a firings

147
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:22,140
has been written by they are Japanese
warrior

148
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,960
some say that book

149
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,380
firing sees been used by accords to run
older business operations

150
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,470
and aren't you the criminals

151
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,900
are using this book for strategy

152
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,079
it might be a good idea for you as well

153
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,700
tour at least to read it when you read
these three books

154
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,660
ritual lay the foundation on have your
understanding of

155
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,590
warfare are try to think about

156
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,970
parallels to the cyber world and no

157
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:59,090
by reading while sir twice you'll see
that there are a lot of parallels

158
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:02,320
the best up to 600

159
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,640
the 600 has arm was arm

160
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,180
and its do is a magazine published for

161
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,330
dozens of years and

162
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:17,510
by reading the best up to 600 you lay a
very good foundation for yourself a very

163
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,980
deep understanding

164
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,720
up the whole history of cybersecurity

165
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,460
when you when you deal this
understanding you'll be

166
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,500
easily able to tool

167
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,090
all new everything else which um going
to be talking about

168
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,660
in this presentation later on now

169
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:41,180
stealing the network is a series of
books this series

170
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,160
is our series of novels its

171
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,630
sometimes very unexpected from a
cybersecurity expert

172
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:53,710
to read novels to understand security
but it's a fact

173
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:57,000
and I'll they are really

174
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,320
extremely good novels explaining

175
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,510
Apax in phnom in a captivating wat and

176
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,830
when you finish them you'll see why

177
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:13,230
they have been voluble to you to
understanding how attacks work in the

178
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,110
real world

179
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:19,130
and how to prevent such attacks in the
future hacking exposed

180
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:25,050
is for people who are not very techincal
and who want to understand the technical

181
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,580
side of cybersecurity

182
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,850
written in a simple way explaining

183
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,230
in a shallow away but a lot of attacks

184
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:37,850
soul if you're not technical this is a
very good book for you

185
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:42,270
and security intelligence is a book
which will help your

186
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:45,530
it should be are the last one

187
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:49,660
you read in the series I'll it will help
you'll

188
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,800
builds though security infrastructure in
your company

189
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,030
you know in a proper way

190
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:59,770
the whole book is extremely technical if
you're not

191
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,860
the one who is building the security of
your organization

192
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:08,060
maybe you're not news now

193
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,590
as

194
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:16,470
sons who says being comparable lies with
yourself

195
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:20,520
you cannot you cannot influence the
enemy

196
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,460
in any way you cannot change them you
gonna change urself

197
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,860
you can only change the security posture
view organization

198
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:33,030
when you change that you began
comparable

199
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,480
you've solved your ask arm

200
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,860
as you can see one up the primary points

201
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,650
in this light is removing the perimeter
defenses

202
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,680
if you keep debris matter defenses on

203
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,980
you'll rely

204
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,670
on of of feeling of security which is
not a realistic

205
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:58,180
it is very far from being realistic

206
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,380
when you remove the brim with the
defense's

207
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:06,150
you'll start thinking about protecting
the things which need protection

208
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:09,330
this is business applications and Ed

209
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:13,770
an end points and servers should protect
them

210
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:18,290
you really don't need perimeter defenses
two companies

211
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:23,140
that I know of have done this the first
company

212
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,740
is guru and the second is copper core
I've not heard

213
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,890
of any other big-name

214
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:34,010
which has successfully remove perimeter
defenses yet

215
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:39,660
bout with do great examples two very big
companies

216
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,340
to a very complex companies I don't know
probably

217
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,460
much more complex than any of us will
ever work on

218
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:50,200
arm if they were able to do it

219
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,830
it should be very achievable for us

220
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:58,140
as well and I'll try to explain how they
did it

221
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:02,060
based on our or a white paper which
Google published

222
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:08,800
right

223
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,960
so Google

224
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,270
room removing the perimeter defenses the

225
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,950
they rely on mom there they rely

226
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:21,570
home several infrastructure elements the
prime

227
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,780
while the primary infrastructure
elements is

228
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,750
their CMDB configuration management
database

229
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,490
their configuration management database
consists of several

230
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,780
other configuration management database
is for

231
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,200
arm for all the operating systems they
have in place

232
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,100
butts they have one metre CMDB

233
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,980
which contains information from all
these databases this gives them

234
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,930
information about

235
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,520
all devices they also have to make the
database

236
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,080
all the users and the two databases

237
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,370
are to key points in their are

238
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:02,220
new infrastructure whenever

239
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,310
are a device tries to connect to the
network

240
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:09,130
there see it is being checked

241
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:12,130
if this device his presence in the CMDB

242
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:15,620
if its present in the CMDB its are

243
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,400
security posture is being checked if
it's updated

244
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,890
is up to date if it contains any
malicious software or doesn't

245
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:26,220
and if everything is fine with the
device

246
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,890
then a certificate from the from this
device is being presented to the axes

247
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:31,470
proxy

248
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,610
then are

249
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:38,450
gases proxy decks with

250
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:42,290
the access control engine arms then

251
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:45,780
the user is being checked from the user
database

252
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,950
but the important thing is the

253
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,810
the important thing is that they don't
rely in the whole process of

254
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:52,850
authentication

255
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:56,260
tool to all corporate system they don't
rely anywhere on our

256
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,300
on a perimeter defense what they really
rely on

257
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,990
is the integrity of data bases are
intuitive

258
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:07,000
end-user devices and and arm

259
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,580
up authentication and axis killer

260
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:15,010
ox is granted to a specific user it was
the same way

261
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:18,740
as it works with your Facebook accounts

262
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:24,160
right now Facebook is providing on
application

263
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,449
the only unfortunately of his books are
only cares about your username and

264
00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:28,870
password

265
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:32,740
probably them for someone you may be a
second player authentication

266
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:39,389
are so cruel house maybe three layers of
authentication

267
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:43,660
they have a username they have a
password behalf are too fat for the

268
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,209
second factor authentication

269
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:50,339
in they also have the device now

270
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:56,610
are at sea let's see an example a
practical example

271
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:00,240
you half are apparel which is

272
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,410
wanna dokie one of the key compliance

273
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,709
monarchy are let's say

274
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:09,770
it's a very confidential information the
Company

275
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,870
and you have a cafe and you have a
dashboard showing

276
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:17,630
some information for developers you need
three levels of control symmetry

277
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,699
three layers of all dilemmas

278
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:25,059
three layers so far permission

279
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:29,340
for the payroll you need to have devices
indication

280
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,970
user authentication arm you need to

281
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:36,960
ensured that the devices
actively-managed and

282
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,380
and also need to ensure that the the
bachelor who is up to date well

283
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:45,030
this is all good firm for the dashboard

284
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,520
you don't need so are such that
stringent checks of course

285
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,380
and for a cafe menu you only need to
authenticate the device

286
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:57,200
and arm it's a very complex system

287
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,220
and there are several challenges here
for

288
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:07,080
let's say for us to build such a system
for us the charges would be

289
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,419
in building the CMDB ensuring its up to
date

290
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:14,780
and our there are not many systems

291
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,090
currently on the market ghoul year olds

292
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:21,830
the wrong with the help of Puppets arm

293
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,450
let's say let's look forward

294
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:29,750
tool Google making the system open
source

295
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,710
arm yeah

296
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:36,850
currently this is not available but
we'll be able to build it in a few

297
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:37,320
months

298
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:45,890
help man who makes it open source and
their

299
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:49,020
are clear clear Mar usability

300
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,830
no his ability beneficial impacts

301
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:56,409
in this case just works

302
00:18:56,409 --> 00:19:02,000
you don't have to rely on VPN when every
need to provide access to user

303
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,159
to some corporates infrastructure
elements

304
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:08,460
you just relied its when

305
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,559
whenever did try to connect they have fu
they have full access

306
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,730
they behalf arm

307
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:20,190
when whenever you ensured that the
device is correct

308
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:24,270
but the device has the proper
certificate on its the device

309
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:27,539
has the patch level the proper a
operating system

310
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:31,149
it house arm proper configuration

311
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:35,429
menu trust the device then if the user
has all the permissions

312
00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:40,380
you don't need a VPN and it's very
difficult to compromise the system

313
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,649
extremely difficult imagine you're a
hacker your device not be able to even

314
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:45,210
connect

315
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:48,529
butts arm

316
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:52,210
let's say it's best for you to review

317
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:55,470
are this very arm very detailed

318
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:59,330
white paper on your own because this is
not the focus of this presentation

319
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:02,649
the focus of this but on on this
presentation will be

320
00:20:02,649 --> 00:20:07,210
on what can be done today what can be
done today

321
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:11,700
are other things which are not even
mentioned on the Google white paper

322
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,120
and that is exploit prevention that is

323
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,309
are hardening and I will show you

324
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:30,830
hands-on what is to be done and how it
needs to be done

325
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,530
the first you need to ensure reno your
network

326
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:36,840
and you in all your your business
environment very well

327
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,220
to know it very well you can half
automated scanners

328
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,520
for vulnerabilities you can half

329
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,340
I'll several penetration tests
unfortunately

330
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,190
our penetration tests a penetration test

331
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:55,530
only focuses some several percent of
your network

332
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:58,970
not the whole network whenever a
penetration test X

333
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,700
is successful this top and they deliver
you the report

334
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,640
this is not enough although I respect
penetration tests

335
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,840
as one of the clearest clearest

336
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,960
arm ways to check the security of your
organization

337
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,110
it's unfortunately not broad enough

338
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:21,400
to have a brought picture half automated
scanners

339
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,220
box it is best to run menu assessments
for manual says months

340
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,990
I recommend see sets as he sets is a
tall

341
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:34,049
developed by arm the homelands

342
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:38,230
defense organization the state's and
I'll show you

343
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:42,299
in just seconds how it works you'll be
able to run it in your own company's

344
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:46,210
it's free to download for now soul

345
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:51,580
just go head down wallet and noms you
find it useful

346
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:57,930
I'm sure

347
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:18,450
rights see sets I'll just spend a couple
minutes on it

348
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,670
while creating an hour we'll create an
assessment

349
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:24,770
and this assessment is manual are

350
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:27,770
the value of this assessment when you do
it

351
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:32,380
and you collect evidence it is

352
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:36,330
are similar let's say it's similar to

353
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:40,340
wats you will do all during a nice old
27:00 01 assessment

354
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:44,290
but I saw are auditors are focused on
one thing

355
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:47,520
they're focused on you on helping you
pass

356
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,530
and gets the ice or certificate if your
are looking for the security of your

357
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:53,520
organization

358
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,150
you're not focused on passing your focus
them actually

359
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:01,330
ensuring you have the proper controls
and noms

360
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:05,500
well the resolution here is not helping
me

361
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:20,710
just a sec

362
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,110
okay

363
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:25,509
the resolution is not helping me January
arm I'll pass this

364
00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:30,190
and I'll just explain how it works it's
our work sweets are very popular

365
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,220
standards

366
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:38,110
home in

367
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:41,679
I'm sure you're familiar it's 853

368
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,909
are missed publication

369
00:23:44,909 --> 00:23:49,850
this she said tall is helping you to
create

370
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:54,269
assessments I'll which deliver reports

371
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:57,889
basam on popular cybersecurity standards

372
00:23:57,889 --> 00:24:01,289
different from I saw and its

373
00:24:01,289 --> 00:24:04,320
creates very good reports well I'm
suggesting you

374
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,240
to do when your R&D assessments and you
collect evidence from your

375
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,950
deems is to ensure everything they say
is true

376
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,960
manually and with dats I'm holding this

377
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,690
and continuing to more practical
examples

378
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:23,769
you'll be able to download see set on
your own it's very easy to use

379
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:28,580
it's basically a checklist let's move on
to know

380
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:34,879
to more practical to the more practical
side what you need to do

381
00:24:34,879 --> 00:24:39,499
are is focus on

382
00:24:39,499 --> 00:24:43,600
on the most spawn the softest past parts
of your network

383
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,779
the softer spartan your network is the
endpoint device

384
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:52,440
and it's the endpoint browser right now
unfortunately many organizations

385
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,759
browsers are deployed as they are

386
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:59,730
there they're deployed usually either
use Internet Explorer

387
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,919
or chrome withdrawn is not hardens and

388
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:07,369
if chrome is not Hardin's then you're
not doing anything

389
00:25:07,369 --> 00:25:10,539
exploitable still be able to easily
bypass

390
00:25:10,539 --> 00:25:14,720
saw are I'll show you very very quickly
how to harden

391
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:22,279
chrome I let's go to

392
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:27,109
all 0 I forgot one thing everything im
talking about

393
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:30,450
every single idea I'm sharing now

394
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:33,460
are use written in a book

395
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:37,119
are the book which I rollet

396
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:41,009
and which will be given for free i dnt
you get a free copy

397
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:44,619
soul are it's a very broad topic

398
00:25:44,619 --> 00:25:49,029
many many broad topics they're very
difficult to

399
00:25:49,029 --> 00:25:53,559
are to cover in a single while in one
hour it's impossible

400
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:57,159
so if I miss anything it will be in the
book

401
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:00,869
and you just download the book and use
it let's move on

402
00:26:00,869 --> 00:26:04,659
chrome hardening

403
00:26:04,659 --> 00:26:08,629
first are too hard in her on

404
00:26:08,629 --> 00:26:12,149
you to deploy properly the only
Deployment Guide which I found

405
00:26:12,149 --> 00:26:16,320
good good enough is dns a: deployment
guide for

406
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,259
the point chrome securely arm

407
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:23,940
let's just go through to our

408
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,769
configuration options in the Group
Policy for Google Chrome

409
00:26:28,769 --> 00:26:37,490
arm

410
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:44,540
justice

411
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,490
this is the most important setting

412
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:49,810
use are allowing running plugins which
are outdated

413
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:54,610
you should disable the setting should be
disabled whenever you have Flash or Java

414
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:58,970
or any other plugin which is updated
this policy directly disables it and

415
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,730
then exploit will not be able to

416
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:04,760
to use it then we have two very

417
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:09,560
handy options for creating a white least
in a black list to view or else

418
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,820
aren't we all know that black lease

419
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:17,580
are useful why police are very difficult
job

420
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:21,580
administer but still having a whitelist
to view or else

421
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:25,340
is the most secure are

422
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,560
best practice tool to run

423
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:33,460
mean to allow users to browse the
internet I know it's very difficult to

424
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,250
administer

425
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:37,290
but saw once you create a baseline

426
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:40,490
with the white least it gets much easier

427
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:44,640
so if you're on the statistics on your
network if your own statistics for a

428
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,180
month

429
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:49,860
and ads the truth and incites you trust
to the white least

430
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:54,650
then it's are much easier to Art New
York else to the white lists

431
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:57,780
whenever somebody wants to visited I'll

432
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:01,970
was to visit the website this is Best's
achieved with a web proxy

433
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:05,550
and when you buy a web proxy or when you
configure web proxy

434
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:09,190
it is best to select an option for

435
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:13,300
arm album article in notifying the
administrator whenever somebody tries to

436
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:13,900
access

437
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,220
a URL and it's not in the database

438
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,550
the user King just click up this all

439
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:23,690
I want to request permission it gets
into the admin

440
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:26,980
but without a white lists it's very
difficult

441
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:30,060
because now we have Margaret Eisen we
have

442
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:34,130
hacked sites you have exploited gets

443
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:39,100
and it's very very very difficult to
maintain the security of your

444
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,060
organization

445
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:44,570
if your web browsing is not secure I'll
show you how to create the white this

446
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:45,300
tweet from

447
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,780
just with Group Policy

448
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:53,120
and this is with these two settings
block access to list view or else

449
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,850
in allow artist all is to the euros if

450
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:00,440
are you want to create the whitelist
your book everything

451
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,390
make creating a policy here

452
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:07,550
and in the least you just enter

453
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:11,130
an asterisk that's it

454
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:14,590
now all your else are blocked and

455
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:19,100
to allow police to view or else just
list them here

456
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,440
half up to 1,000 this is not applicable

457
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,770
for all situations and it is very

458
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:30,560
arm it is applicable in only the most
sense different varmints

459
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,020
but I'm just showing it can be done with
gruel

460
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,120
with SAR group policies and its best
done

461
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,380
on your web proxy this is just to show
it it's possible

462
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:47,170
on our on the Group Policy Editor rights

463
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:50,520
arm there many other settings here

464
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,420
which I don't have the time to discuss
all of them

465
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:57,500
you'll be able to find in our

466
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:02,460
in the NSA deployment guide for cool
from now

467
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:06,380
Google Chrome needs to be protected from
are advising

468
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:10,840
your browser's your your users need to
be protected from advertising

469
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,960
to protect a moderate Ising you can use
your

470
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,470
our web filters are ability to block
covered eyes mint

471
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:22,780
but you can also use a Mar a plugin or
extension here

472
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:26,210
which is

473
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:29,620
you block the reason I'm recommending
you block

474
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,160
is because abt walk has signed
agreements

475
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,870
with 300 ad networks to white lease them

476
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:41,350
and still allow them Sol if any of the
three hundred networks

477
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:44,690
easel outs are Ennis

478
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:49,050
compromised then your usage afar are
blocking plugin these

479
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:52,810
arm is meaningless are you block

480
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:56,660
has no such agreements and you block has
much more options

481
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:02,700
which I'll show you now

482
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,240
one of the most important

483
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,789
aspects eased up morty dude a fielder's

484
00:31:08,789 --> 00:31:12,299
you half as you can see there is also a
Russian fielder

485
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:15,320
why why is this important

486
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,820
it's important because from my
experience maybe

487
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:22,200
a lot of incidents happen when I

488
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,519
Margaret Eisen is used and

489
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,809
the most effective way to bookmark
revising

490
00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:32,019
is to book a chance it's a very simple
solution

491
00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:35,629
extremely simple solution any is
extremely

492
00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:39,840
effective solution if you'll enable
Margaret Eisen balking

493
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:45,730
in your company if you block ads you'll
get a read if ten to thirty percent of

494
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,070
all security incidents

495
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:50,399
which is a really high number

496
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,399
and it's a really cheap solution from

497
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:58,549
are from an effort perspective and I it
will be really a shame

498
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:01,899
if you don't implement this mom

499
00:32:01,899 --> 00:32:05,470
now another plugin is you matrix

500
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:08,549
and when you visit dr. all

501
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:13,090
I don't think you have internet here but
when you visit the euro

502
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:17,409
you'll be able to are if something
doesn't work you just wipe used by

503
00:32:17,409 --> 00:32:18,289
clicking here

504
00:32:18,289 --> 00:32:22,249
and noms it is for technical users

505
00:32:22,249 --> 00:32:27,350
is not for deploying across the whole
enterprise but I recommend it for you

506
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:31,570
if are you care about your own safety
and protection

507
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:35,309
just I use this tool plugins they'll get
rid of moderate doesn't

508
00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:40,230
very effectively NeXT's

509
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:43,640
makes me want to protect wash and flash

510
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:48,000
in 99 percent of the organization's

511
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,100
is not hardened and is not protected in
any way let's hope

512
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,350
it is being updated but I'm sure

513
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:59,400
in many organizations is not but let's
imagine a dream world

514
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:04,320
where your company's updating flash
constantly let's improve the situation

515
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,420
by are also hardening flash

516
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:10,860
and you do this by following it still

517
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:15,170
this is also in the book butts arm you
follow our guides

518
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:19,130
which is by a dole for hardening flash

519
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:23,390
what you do is you go to Windows
system32 Macromedia

520
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:28,400
it's just find it

521
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:33,180
flash

522
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,100
and there is a configuration file which
by default

523
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,500
on many system does not exist so you
just

524
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,640
ended it and

525
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,470
d only setting which is usually present
the silent out-of-date enable

526
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:52,100
1 I'm adding here Ardis

527
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,270
settings Witcher all mentioned in Dar

528
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:58,490
dole Adobe are Administration Guide for
flash

529
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:01,940
which effectively when are

530
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,040
when your browser's got bring your Flash
plugin is compromised

531
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:10,830
by by our exploits usually DX point
tries to bomb or the file

532
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:14,110
unity for Jay Peak or something else
been

533
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:17,580
on on disk decrypts the file and
executed

534
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:22,170
if you disable the functionality to bomb
old files

535
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:25,690
you flush if you disable the
functionality

536
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:29,230
to use sockets and are a if you disable

537
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:32,850
access to the file system to flash then
you get reads

538
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:36,190
a full of exploits and this is very
usefull

539
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:42,120
and they really recommend the too hard
and flash NeXT's

540
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:46,790
half arm

541
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:49,960
might listing of course its its

542
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,590
good to have most likely will not be
able to implemented due to the

543
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,000
administration calls

544
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,860
butts are if you implement a secure

545
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:02,690
deployments as into NSA guide you'll be
fine

546
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:07,580
now my best friend is a Mets I'm it is
my best friend

547
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:11,520
because it's easy to administer it's
very cheap way

548
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,110
to increase the cost of exploitation
because

549
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:19,330
are they react there are bypasses for
inmates

550
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:22,430
their some companies like offensive
security

551
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:25,870
and others who have developed bypasses

552
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:29,530
for a Mets but start to bypass a Mets

553
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:34,250
is very difficult and most exploit a
ricer writers most exploit kits

554
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:38,470
does do not contain waz to bypass a Mets

555
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:43,000
and matt is a very small pic Asian its
arm

556
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,590
in most cases it will not crash your
system's

557
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:50,080
if it happens I'll show you how to
troubleshoot it

558
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,500
it's very easy all its goal to the are

559
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:58,830
met administration if I have my mouse
home

560
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:06,420
right

561
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,240
by default million storm its it will be

562
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:13,319
in the recommended security settings are

563
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:17,559
as soon as you install its you can
change to Maxim security settings for me

564
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:20,930
I have not found arm beak impact

565
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:24,640
then if an app crashes by default

566
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,369
this is all you need to do but he fun
app crashes inside your network

567
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:32,480
some user complains that let's say
internet explorer crashes all the time

568
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,119
for them

569
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,010
and it displays the amid pop-up or word
crashes for them

570
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:40,150
or anything else crashes for him all the
time it's caused by a met

571
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:44,859
by incompatibility with your anti-virus
then you just go to the app settings

572
00:36:44,859 --> 00:36:49,250
and IR in your event wats

573
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,299
you'll see which protection for the
specific user

574
00:36:52,299 --> 00:36:55,460
is 3 hearing the crash you just

575
00:36:55,460 --> 00:37:00,170
unchecked these protection leave all the
other protections on you'll be fine

576
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:03,980
if you're not able to just finds find
the protection which is causing the

577
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,670
crash in this particular system

578
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:08,750
and uncheck it just do it

579
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,960
on a case by case basis because I'm 95
percent

580
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,259
ninety-nine percent of your
organization's computers you not have

581
00:37:15,259 --> 00:37:16,190
any crashes

582
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:20,740
and it's best to leave all protections
on are

583
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:24,200
by now hopefully you've got three the
Margaret Eisen

584
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,990
you got three love exploits to a large
degree

585
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:31,490
and it has been very cheap it's been
done

586
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:35,339
by just the point chrome just deploying
a couple fixed asians

587
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:38,650
Animax this are

588
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:43,970
in a practical situation takes for our
1,000 2,000 employees network

589
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:48,059
it takes two weeks work with testing

590
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:56,180
are with proper testing right

591
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:56,800
next

592
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,000
is softer a restriction policies

593
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,110
enough Walker with SRP

594
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:06,280
you can easily block several

595
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,700
attack vectors you can block execution
from removable drives

596
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:14,590
with a single policy-setting and our

597
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:19,510
you can book execution from temporary
locations by bookings addition from

598
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,680
temporary locations

599
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,660
everything which is getting downloaded
by an exploit

600
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:28,910
on your browser and tries to execute it
will be blocked

601
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:32,500
by a simple policy most simple
policy-setting

602
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:39,720
let me just show quickly how it's done
sawing the Group Policy Editor

603
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,660
you go to Windows settings security
settings

604
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:47,710
again this is on the book just in case
you missed it

605
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:52,070
arm sought a rescission policies

606
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:55,460
additional rules all which

607
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:59,610
come systems that okay now

608
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:03,480
I have two sets of policies once it is
for the

609
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,750
admins and the other set of policy is
forward a regular users

610
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:12,700
this is needed because you cannot book
always delicious

611
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:17,080
and our if you block execution from
temporary locations

612
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,390
these relations break so what you need
to do for your

613
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:23,550
regular users you need assault a
rescission policy

614
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:26,620
which is arm booking

615
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:30,270
most other things in for your admin
users you're blocking

616
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:33,880
almost any nothing and hard to do dats

617
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:38,080
you create two sets policies to create a
two sets of policies

618
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,080
in an enterprise environment you what
creates

619
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,290
to are organizational units

620
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:47,910
or two groups in a walker environments
in a

621
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:51,740
you know work group situation like sign
my virtual machine

622
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:58,870
you need to or on MMC other news

623
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:02,440
been observer group policy object

624
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,440
then you browse

625
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,080
in you selecting the user's non
administrators

626
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,290
this group is not visible in the

627
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:16,920
you know generic user and group
management

628
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:21,230
but it's visible here so in order to see
them on Arden Group Policies

629
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:34,730
you select this and now we'll see

630
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:37,520
although additional rules to see I'm
blocking

631
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:43,170
all temporary locations for non admin
users with this

632
00:40:43,170 --> 00:41:08,210
if I change the user

633
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:09,870
for change the user I can

634
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:14,220
I can still executes applications which
are allowed but I cannot

635
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:18,050
executes any stores for anything which
trice

636
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:23,340
which tries to rights are which tries to
rights

637
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:26,370
in temp folder unfortunately I cannot
see

638
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:30,870
the store had here but the for had the
store he recruits

639
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:35,020
army will not burn anyway you know

640
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:42,160
my dams I see that they have only 15
minutes

641
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,470
and for 15 minutes I'll show you the
most important part of his presentation

642
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:51,610
I everything else is doing the book the
most important part of this presentation

643
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:57,820
is our sticks if you're not too familiar
with the concept of security technical

644
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,070
implementation guides

645
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:03,710
you should get familiar because this is
the most important part of the stock

646
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:08,310
are sticks are being developed by Ian R

647
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:11,690
Defense Information Systems agency the
state's

648
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:15,250
unfortunately no other country no other

649
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:19,300
no other organization has spent the
effort which the seller has spent

650
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,970
and arm sticks are basically

651
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:26,810
imagine all of your corporate systems
operating systems

652
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:31,560
or switches or outsource everything
every single setting

653
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:35,580
which is are capable of improving the
security of these device

654
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:39,010
replication or an operating system is
detailed

655
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:42,060
in the security technical implementation
guides a visa

656
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,390
their XML files and noms

657
00:42:45,390 --> 00:43:04,880
I'll show you how to work with them just
two seconds

658
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:14,810
just moments

659
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:26,530
well this is a shame right

660
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:30,730
should internet connection

661
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:42,109
just a moment

662
00:43:42,109 --> 00:43:46,660
all rights

663
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:47,350
should have

664
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:55,130
had the viewer here but site has been
wiped by

665
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:59,380
arm by snapshots

666
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:02,620
in just a moment I'll Donald quickly

667
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:12,550
mommy

668
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:18,980
as we have all our newsletter here we
have a wireless network

669
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:25,480
is the

670
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:34,620
okay

671
00:44:34,620 --> 00:45:03,269
limited to connect cool

672
00:45:03,269 --> 00:45:09,450
me a moment while

673
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:12,869
long searching for it though just
explain quickly mystique

674
00:45:12,869 --> 00:45:17,359
sticks are are XML documents which you
can view

675
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:21,369
with a stick viewer everything I'm are
trying to explain now

676
00:45:21,369 --> 00:45:25,540
which crashed crash now everything is
explained in the book

677
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:29,190
which you'll get a free copy addendum
the presentation are

678
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:32,970
sticks you work with them by arm

679
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:36,220
in two ways you know there is an online
Steve your

680
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:40,849
which has all the sticks are online then
you down all

681
00:45:40,849 --> 00:45:44,220
an excel file let's say you want to
protect chrome

682
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:48,869
or you want to protect their outer you
you'll go to the stick viewer

683
00:45:48,869 --> 00:45:52,530
and you see all the security settings
you export into an Excel spreadsheet

684
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:57,290
and now you give them to the network
team or Windows admin team moral

685
00:45:57,290 --> 00:46:00,849
whoever is taking care of the device
they create a template which is applied

686
00:46:00,849 --> 00:46:02,170
to all your devices

687
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:06,300
or its menu needs done manually but in
all cases

688
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,349
are using a stick is d

689
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:13,569
is the most effective way to hard in the
system and two

690
00:46:13,569 --> 00:46:18,000
harden every single sitting inside I
have not found

691
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,520
anywhere away tool

692
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:28,800
to harlem a system better than using a
stick right it seems that they gots

693
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,440
finally its

694
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,810
all not really to Nexus is

695
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:40,319
sketchy anyway

696
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:43,910
it's in the book have 10 minutes arm

697
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:48,420
just read about sticks in the book okay
om

698
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:51,770
further hardening consider

699
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:55,500
the don your workstations and on their
servers you have executed balls

700
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,810
which are not needed these execute ables

701
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:01,890
dole are very useful during a compromise

702
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:05,109
in the most useful love them use
PowerShell

703
00:47:05,109 --> 00:47:08,550
if you get to relive PowerShell on all
systems

704
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:12,760
which don't need then you get to relive
far

705
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:17,750
let's say some people call partial post
exploitation fret framework

706
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:21,540
and there is a reason for that all these
executables

707
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,630
again the least is in the book

708
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:28,510
are all these executables are used
during a compromise

709
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:32,150
if you delete them and whenever you need
them you can bring them on our

710
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:36,520
you know external device or on a network
share arm

711
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,210
then you get rid of of ways

712
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:44,920
for a frown doctor to make dinner life
easy you make their life difficult

713
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:51,220
are for patching it's best to use the
CSS punching policy

714
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:54,490
not just relying on on patching lar

715
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:59,230
on your own ideas of botching if you
cool CSS botching policy

716
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:03,619
you'll see what I'm talking about is are
is a preference

717
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:06,819
have speed of patching depending on the
exploits

718
00:48:06,819 --> 00:48:13,410
criticality honey in its high Potts
intrusions

719
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:16,599
and cloud providers now arm

720
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:21,500
adding small in mirrors and making
yourself invisible

721
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:26,560
and creating intelligence are for
understanding attackers

722
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,730
is done with high net and honey pots

723
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:33,490
to understand how attackers a
compromising your network is best to run

724
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:33,960
a

725
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:37,369
honing its and a honeypot and now

726
00:48:37,369 --> 00:48:40,430
when you're on the inside your network
and now

727
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:45,200
and monitor what is happening in your
honey pots

728
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:50,339
you will gain intelligence which is in
some ways better

729
00:48:50,339 --> 00:48:52,110
then nom buying

730
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:55,810
subscription intelligence for your seems
seem solution

731
00:48:55,810 --> 00:49:00,950
now are you need to differentiate

732
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:04,610
decides everything else I've talked
about your

733
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:08,450
foreign until now you need to
differentiate

734
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:11,650
among your infrastructure elements

735
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:14,950
in order to make the life one attacker

736
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:19,230
much more difficult for example you
might want to

737
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:23,670
not use a certain arm a certain vendor
for your firewall

738
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:27,230
are certain vendor for your router
because we all know that's a

739
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:30,540
some vendors recently became known for
placing

740
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:35,490
back doors interior systems are I'm not
mention any names

741
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:39,510
butts are ugg boots alternative for
routers for example

742
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:42,630
is B is your older bro checked I'll

743
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:46,140
by performance it I'm

744
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:49,370
of course it cannot be as
high-performing as

745
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:53,960
arm as other products you basically need

746
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:58,340
twice as powerful the processor that's
it and a little bit more memory

747
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:02,190
then now for a firewall a big
organization can use

748
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:07,140
cannot use these a small organization
can know if your organization is

749
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:11,460
as several hundred people you don't
really need to buy a commercial for all

750
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:15,850
you only need to use be assessed the
assessor open sense

751
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:19,300
if you're using Bynes has your DNS
server

752
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:24,080
you should stop as soon as possible
really because binds

753
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,470
has been known for vulnerabilities

754
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:30,720
and DJB DNS on the other hand

755
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,700
has been on the having almost mom
vulnerabilities

756
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:38,510
so it's a good idea to at least best BGB
DNS

757
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:42,700
to at least bullet donna's on a side by
side comparison

758
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:46,870
with bind maybe you'll find the BJP DNS
is all you need

759
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:50,250
next is skewed so I S

760
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:53,600
Kinner are everybody who has

761
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:57,160
used cubes I S raise their hand 1

762
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:01,400
okay three people I love this room

763
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,100
you know on a security conference

764
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:06,530
this is a shame really arm

765
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:10,190
I urge you to download cubes I S

766
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:13,390
it only ransom hardware box

767
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:17,800
it cannot run in them in a virtual
environment bites are

768
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:23,140
as of now this is the most secure
operating system you can run

769
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:27,750
are the more secure free operating
system you can run

770
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:30,760
of course there are integrity oil s

771
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:34,400
and QNX butts cubes OS is one which

772
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,950
you can use it can be used even

773
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:41,710
by are non-technical users it's
basically

774
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:45,400
form for the user its a Linux box

775
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:49,190
and for Linux box what users mostly miss

776
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:52,840
today is their office office package

777
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:56,140
for the office package are you can try

778
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:59,470
on Linux you can try running kingsoft
Office

779
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:04,100
has any min use kingsoft Office no

780
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:07,700
okay try it kingsoft Office is

781
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:11,150
almost as good as Microsoft Office and
it's free

782
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:14,840
and it's much better than LibreOffice or
OpenOffice

783
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:18,210
it's built by a Chinese company maybe
that's why I'm

784
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:21,370
most people have not heard about it but
one benefits

785
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:26,030
of Kingsoft Office even on Windows
systems is sorry Visual Basic Mauer

786
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:26,730
cannot run

787
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:31,110
and now we all know that Visual Basic

788
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:34,520
is one of the key factors to compromise

789
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:39,240
corporate environments besides
monetizing besides exploit kits

790
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:43,240
arm best obsd is another option

791
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:48,450
now arm some people are more targeted
than others

792
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:51,680
you know corporate environments and
these people

793
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:55,600
are usually the seals assistance the
seals assistance

794
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:59,050
does not necessarily need a Windows
operating system

795
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:02,240
CEO's assistant mites

796
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,890
get by weeds kingsoft Office on a Linux
box

797
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:09,619
and maybe are a group

798
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:12,520
arm email clients and

799
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:16,670
most of the times that's all they need
if our

800
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:19,930
if you're if you protects the most
targeted users

801
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:25,060
in such a way you increase the security
for your

802
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:29,030
organization significantly and that's
what I mean by differentiation

803
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:33,990
you you it's best to differentiate the
operating system to run

804
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:37,730
in your environment whenever you can run
Linux

805
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:41,380
instead of the Windows desktop whenever
you can on the ID

806
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:44,470
desktops you can run cubes Voice

807
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:47,790
it's not necessary to run are

808
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:51,270
to run Windows soul

809
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:54,290
yeah have just four minutes

810
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:57,720
this is the book euro the book

811
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:01,099
I've spent months in writing its you arm

812
00:54:01,099 --> 00:54:04,210
this presentation was supposed to
compress

813
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:07,700
everything in one hour unfortunately
it's very difficult

814
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:11,349
to compress everything on our Sol

815
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:15,099
arm creating creating a cyber fortress

816
00:54:15,099 --> 00:54:18,550
is this book arm

817
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:22,109
just go ahead and related 3

818
00:54:22,109 --> 00:54:25,170
no are any questions

819
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:28,460
we have we have few minutes all all

820
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:36,950
welcome any questions please are you a
person

821
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:41,800
sink or talk utilized to use the

822
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:45,010
white least school urals but

823
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:46,320
you

824
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:49,010
don't see use white lease for

825
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:53,310
applications application whitelisting

826
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:57,490
-ism is a very good idea and application
whitelisting

827
00:54:57,490 --> 00:55:00,640
can be achieved with softer restriction
policies an op Walker

828
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,800
and achieving this the way to achieve
this

829
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:09,070
is in the book okie yes application
whitelisting is extremely important

830
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:12,260
and now it's also extremely important

831
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:16,680
to monitor any execution Affinia
plication which is not in the white

832
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:17,190
least

833
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:20,260
because application whitelisting with up
Walker

834
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:25,119
and soft a rescission policies can be
bypassed it has been proven to be

835
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:25,890
bypassed

836
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:30,710
so you need to monitor in their ways to
monitor we did

837
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:35,030
are free all with free tools monitoring
which reduces also in the book and

838
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:35,710
commercial

839
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:43,619
tools everything is in sight

840
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:47,020
models gonna the muslims been approved
go top car

841
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:51,930
russian-u_s_ on figure much you've
collected

842
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:55,599
many thoughts and 21 peace question

843
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:59,460
have seen could to implement

844
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:02,760
peace all you mention about into one

845
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:06,250
and price yes yes amended

846
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:10,210
I've participated in such
implementations are

847
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:13,540
how to convince how to convince your
management

848
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:16,599
to implement these ideas in n

849
00:56:16,599 --> 00:56:21,330
are always to communicate your ideas to
higher management

850
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:24,950
are also in the book so I've tried and
try to help

851
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:29,170
to cover everything which you might need
inside arm

852
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:32,330
your biggest challenge implementation of

853
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:36,340
all these is convincing management's
that they can resched

854
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:39,450
such implementation because such
implementations

855
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:42,720
are risky application whitelisting is
risky web

856
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:47,970
URL widely thing is risky and management
is usually trying to avoid risks

857
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:51,780
so if you're are able to communicate to
them properly

858
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:55,869
they will give you a test environment if
you prove that it works in a test

859
00:56:55,869 --> 00:56:56,500
environment

860
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:00,550
they will give you ready are green light
to implement it in

861
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:03,890
he now in production just be be careful

862
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:07,250
and always prove yourself in the best
implement

863
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:13,400
that's what I can recommend I suppose

864
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,930
you

865
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:15,190
super
