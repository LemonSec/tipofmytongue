1
00:00:05,709 --> 00:00:06,240
buddies

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,180
I know a lot of the personally and

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,470
my report will be dedicated to the

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:18,400
open redirect vulnerabilities it's quite
a popular billion and everybody consider

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:18,910
its

6
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,560
even considers it there its full scale
on our ability

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,220
so we can easily find me online with a
big bite your neck

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,599
bone believe

9
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,800
we have personally talk to the lottery
online

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,399
anyway open we do acts

11
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,440
according to an

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,250
the West Pacific Asian or description
it's an open where at the end

13
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,000
application that takes a parameter and
reiterates user to the

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,210
rather well with loud any

15
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:57,530
validation and basically the end user
goes to certain hostess have a trivial

16
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:01,030
saying that lady is saved every day

17
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,030
and there's nothing specifically you

18
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:09,619
new here's something sensational nothing
but directors candid

19
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:12,729
you're inclined side for example be at
the

20
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:17,930
that tags: or on business shows scripted

21
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:21,580
can also be in a server-side said

22
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,530
301 302 303 307

23
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,390
the nurse a response so directed this is

24
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,580
redirection to certain and host go

25
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,150
usually directors look

26
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,640
the like this and they're quite simple
there's a client it sends

27
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,830
a certain package to the server and the
server checks

28
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:49,180
whether yes sir no be

29
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,610
answer is situated in a Cell network
that this said

30
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,119
as you were talking about the trusted
directories here so there's her one

31
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:57,950
server to

32
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,270
old and they are into a single app

33
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:05,380
and if you have ever read the supper
room about mailer Yandex

34
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,640
as a good tnx because he comes forward
so

35
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,700
there's one sub de mi novia next there's
another sub emina beyond X

36
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,540
and their redirect without any problems
there's nothing bad about that

37
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,000
just particularly bad about that a bad
thing comes when

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,680
users at the end how's the user can give
would

39
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,750
some outside resource good which is not

40
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:34,130
in the network this leads to the fact
that the world the simplest thing is

41
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:34,549
that

42
00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:39,070
it's possible to organize fishing
arrange fishing Santa Fe

43
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:44,010
could in sport page where it is possible
to redirect user and get his

44
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,690
authentification data it's a popular
practice

45
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,989
and generally good

46
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:54,440
and there's certain degree for danger
here

47
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,680
if you often visit different kinda
popular Web sites

48
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,300
most people are probably will get the
end page saying that the

49
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,020
and link is might be not say Prince
recommended to get their surgeon web

50
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,610
sites

51
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,780
are trying to survey the security so
these are there no problems there

52
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,230
however it

53
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,820
the ringer acts are available almost at
any web side

54
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,890
to just our website's it

55
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:23,700
here are the logo's some those web sites
where

56
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:29,150
they really these kinda services but
where there

57
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,530
there it is but County opened other
software worry it's possible to

58
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:38,070
report a vulnerability get a certain
ivory numeration for that work for less

59
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,870
so these are the

60
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:43,000
leading companies which are most
interesting to researchers

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,640
because of course searching for lease on
their site is only useful in pleasure

62
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,330
but also get something

63
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,380
back for that that's that's good always
good that's

64
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,900
guanabana moderating encouraging so
let's look at these kind of things

65
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,850
from time to time

66
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:05,300
good

67
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,489
as muscle to fine-tune vulnerabilities
me about bounty for example

68
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:11,730
black tip and found the labor union is
that allowed to you

69
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:17,100
swap war redirect the user to the end
page

70
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,769
as a result I love not filtering the

71
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:26,020
lower dash sign did not culture so could
just created

72
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,320
subdomain with a lowered as Shane
successfully go around the security

73
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,120
beyond X

74
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,419
the other case is when we look at the
open referred active Twitter

75
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:39,510
for example they were certain problems
there

76
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,600
with redirection the user's and

77
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,850
here's a small piece of

78
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:49,310
hell another pen testers bound

79
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,400
the way to redirect the fees are flow

80
00:04:52,400 --> 00:05:00,200
around certain protocols

81
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,800
I went

82
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,970
further good I think the previous
schemes are not so interesting because

83
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,440
working again only patch that's quite
boring

84
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,660
so let's try something new that's why

85
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,980
I'd but my work based on search up the
chain vulnerabilities when they're

86
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,640
certain

87
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,110
member chains did lead to huge leak or
huge Burke

88
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:25,890
bigger bag so in this case we're looking
to ski where the client sends a certain

89
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,940
baxter's syrup for example this river

90
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,470
Yandex can text checks that the NL's

91
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,840
is inside a network beyond action citing
subnetwork

92
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,300
and the second show we'll have another
redirect that allows

93
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,520
we directed to the open house so this is
kind ever

94
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,980
complex change and there are limitations
inside a bit however

95
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:51,470
which you look in practice how that
works

96
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:57,060
so we have beyond X here

97
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,270
at the service again next they're so sup
de manger square

98
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:04,060
pure them were responsible for directing
the user to some

99
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:10,020
random hosts particularly random hosts
why is this possible because you're next

100
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,440
is great system

101
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,530
the dow to some cold Mandy add see which
can register

102
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:19,750
your own web a website on your index and
pay certain amount of money and then

103
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,700
whipped it'll be given to the user

104
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:26,600
in search results so it's possible to
get that link via which the Caesar gets

105
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,480
to our website

106
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:32,230
and this will look can like this like
that this gonna sup de mean sub-index

107
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:38,200
their lot in them but these are there
the most widespread

108
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:44,590
they can be easily found on Google so
watered

109
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:48,710
our task now is to you finding your next
two pages

110
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:53,470
offenders which retard the users to
certain subdomain

111
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:58,400
I look through the door could

112
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,160
the index website where power we found

113
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,640
a few domains we we saw that certain

114
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,740
subdomains are vulnerable by the way
they are old pics right now so

115
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,070
the worst though the mail was well
herbal

116
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:18,770
good some corporate portal

117
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,830
should

118
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,710
all in all there is a number of
subdomains sub domains that allowed to

119
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,700
return to

120
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,490
other subdomains the index would

121
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,060
so let's look at tomorrow's primitive

122
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,190
would thing male Yandex ru

123
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:41,860
and the tnx mail so there's we've passed
that process or so

124
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:46,370
if we give this ion my your next male
resident puff

125
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:51,760
its it's it's gonna cycle thing cycle

126
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,040
attack my name called an attack so
incentive mail your next week we could

127
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,750
go to money and X through

128
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:03,240
direct an extra anything any sub domains
etc and extra

129
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,780
so as a result if you're trying t

130
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:11,310
did this brother any website that's not
directly related to your next airports

131
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,180
just google

132
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,040
the there will be no redirection and the
usual get

133
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,490
the air and will just return so we're
back somewhere to the male probably

134
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,600
because word now by renowned nope

135
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,860
messing with the mail cell

136
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,100
now the most interesting thing F way

137
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:33,550
and as vulnerable arrival the sub
domains such some sub to me know yet is

138
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,870
that are you suggesting

139
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:39,880
a subdomain I relate to ads we can eat
easily go around the security policies

140
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,710
are VNX what's the problem here

141
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:45,210
we can easily when sister a legitimate
website

142
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,690
in their direct system it will be

143
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,780
min nice web side to shop for example

144
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:57,880
can be popular and they will be now
problem in registration

145
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,360
bad that host will be fully under our
control can easily

146
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,990
show up in some extra read a reaction to
it to anyone about

147
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,970
H scan over

148
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,620
stretch this is due to stretch bed

149
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:15,790
this is possible so if we want to you

150
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:19,080
making it into the end user when to take
the avenue through

151
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,810
as a reef have we send our ad a

152
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,600
add link to those two dominant at
legitimate on-demand there's the

153
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,850
link to the fishing side free sample so

154
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,820
if somebody address so saying OK we were
hacked how does that work

155
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,680
hope have somebody on

156
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,360
ask us how is that possible we just say
that somebody had to somebody attacked

157
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,070
as so

158
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:47,100
this is why so why did a young dicks not
see the possibility to

159
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,820
quitter akin to its internal domain so
it was found out the guy said okay we're

160
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,530
gonna fix it

161
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:56,290
today morning I sell it yet the bleed it
fix it there no problems

162
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:00,800
so let's continue let's look at the
second and

163
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,010
well-known system mailed out are you
good

164
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:09,530
mail it are you has a very Bridget scope

165
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:12,550
good

166
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:18,400
for what they actually pay be bird

167
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,620
and one of the key saddam means here
pool

168
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,800
for which there to really care about is
the

169
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,790
authentification system it mail that are
you so there are also certain redirects

170
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,230
here

171
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:33,200
and their trusted their world tuned me

172
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,440
not none that a problem there the single
hinge there's

173
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,300
film good

174
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:44,360
nears its success right direction he
there such as games mail ru

175
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,560
gets mail ru a problem but if some out
says resource

176
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,460
everything is barred immediately
networks fine that's right we're gonna

177
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,089
AP an interesting scenario here where we
can in

178
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:00,360
a few stages go around that security
system

179
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,850
and the the most interesting thing here

180
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:10,000
is stick a lactose up damn maynes of
mail ru and search for radar at since I

181
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,600
did them

182
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,660
and did

183
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:18,490
just do the selma's the same scheme airs
at your index

184
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:22,709
to we're looking at the sub domains were
looking for a direct and analyze them

185
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:25,800
we founded on other projects

186
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,150
at necklace thank you we found so humus

187
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:29,880
a

188
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,080
did say the following I

189
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,220
will be true shouldn't pay attention to
it because we found it done mccleskey

190
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,030
too much early woods forget about the
pointed at my question he was

191
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,880
the at some point behind to buy I'm a
little and

192
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,920
said it's not part in the mail network
because

193
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,300
that's why I didn't pay attention to it
but I'm a little didn't pay attention to

194
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,090
it initially but

195
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,440
this redirect to add a question from a
low is the most vulnerable

196
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,930
spied to their network so we found out
that

197
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:02,130
there's the LES I

198
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:06,180
the sub-domain a classic that are you in
SF would wish searching for because

199
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,110
there's the redirect

200
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:11,290
there's the valuable redirect their and
there's the mail was own

201
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:15,110
so it fits in perfectly so if we tried
to you

202
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,370
9 get from the on certification system
to

203
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,740
know I'd like wesley g a sub-domain we
should can

204
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,290
easily get there but that's not it now
we wanna see

205
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:29,240
a the following contact the client sends
certain package to

206
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,370
of male Rouen is a set of parameters
there's and the quest think your website

207
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:38,230
an air we also have the fishing hose as
the additional prouder there so

208
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:43,670
this would be it but to start an easy
turns out

209
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,980
that in a class gmail ru

210
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,880
we see if there's their own security
system additional security system

211
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,590
independent from the mailroom
authentification so

212
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,880
there's this kind of thing they're
called this

213
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,880
dire interested reader writes so I think
less Nikki

214
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,570
will allow the users to get too upset
which are manually check by the

215
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:06,840
administration which is

216
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:11,410
hard which is difference tration but
buried ad for a bit testers

217
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:17,040
to to can easily go from neglecting to
your next email to Google but if we get

218
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,210
but BB swap for the sum some head

219
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,990
some host

220
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:27,530
which would have just created it buna
impossible to a director that host

221
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:27,950
because

222
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:31,910
is not been manually checked entrusted
by the administration

223
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:36,480
so each day here's what kinda warning
would get if

224
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,980
that house was not check manually by the
administration

225
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,020
gonna be there their rejection of

226
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,700
redirection I thought they'll be
interesting so tour dates in a row

227
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,680
that's something that's why we made a
decision to dig deeper here

228
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,180
and search for how it actually works yet

229
00:13:54,180 --> 00:14:01,060
and did we decided to phase I love it

230
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,180
internet interest to me that

231
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:08,310
the security systems and not simply let
you access and press the domains but

232
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,020
also

233
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:13,370
I'll let CEO says all the trusses
sub-domain so we can easily

234
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:17,330
with day you're next are you as the
charge it was but also some non existing

235
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,220
oh such as

236
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,150
vice a touch bionics is going to call it
that ducky and those that are you

237
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,980
anything at all easily get redirected
there so

238
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,690
cool this of course

239
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:33,400
a huge gap in the security system so we
decided

240
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,060
to freeze the use the existing today
said we found nearly so domains to

241
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:41,430
added you to redirect tnx and at-risk
thnx recaps Yandex ru

242
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,930
I and

243
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:46,470
and as a result other useful ot when as
host

244
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:52,000
we all said communicate their I
additional fishing house where we want

245
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,750
easier to go so this link would look

246
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,830
somehow like this this looks parable of
course to send something like this

247
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:02,570
but for a while this worked and the
bench here are the following:

248
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:08,700
all the in the email the incoming mail
are the domain from Nintendo main are

249
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,820
from a lot are you

250
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:15,020
usually not suspicious if we drop out
this horrible to SoCal you easily

251
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,910
going around the x10 filter so it's
thrilling to their own a hoe so

252
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:22,560
there's no problems with the user
there's no security problem so

253
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,750
easily forget about spam here a

254
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,680
so how do we get free in the square ball
lengthy detailed link

255
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,200
not to who you are such initially so we
get did to the

256
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,149
coder we transform into bed entities and
get this

257
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:40,660
upn more handsome

258
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,270
but still not so handsome tail so but
this is an option the attack

259
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:48,680
so in the end the pain scam looks like
this it's a long scheme

260
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,680
declined send certain Mary two-out mail
ru

261
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,420
and as a parameter is being redirected
to

262
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,910
I think lessening gmail that are you
which does not exist as a separate

263
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,700
domain

264
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:05,120
and there's a fool redirection with all
predators to al Qaeda

265
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,779
are you are requesting that are you and
then there's a direction and

266
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:09,770
vulnerability to

267
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:14,610
Yandex subdomain from getting suited tag
host which can be controlled

268
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:17,620
and again get to the next target Coast
so

269
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:21,540
it's a chain of five or six or seven
changed

270
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:26,029
which is quite problematic but
nevertheless it works on my break now

271
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:28,500
but when we publish color but it didn't
work

272
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,880
would

273
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,110
why else do I wanna say here the sky
network consisting 7 hosts

274
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:41,149
actually good

275
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:45,920
terrible nobody's that can to limit the
chain 24 hosts

276
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,120
and go on certain problems the Husky pup
me in this can attack the PC is

277
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,709
presley that the user must be logged in
and that's essential

278
00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:01,640
an Apple user has blocked in they can be
this kind of attack

279
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:06,130
the second problem as that we must I
register aside in there

280
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:10,089
agenda except direct system must go to
the check procedure

281
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:14,079
and dads require certain time
investments so

282
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,800
the set the most pleasurable things did

283
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,909
so these are the two problems that we
have detectives possible now

284
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:24,590
allows for directing the user which is

285
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:28,680
neither either logged in or not load and
and all around the problems

286
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,600
so this way we can go around the system
without any press domains at all without

287
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,610
ya neck for that

288
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:38,550
any systems this is great but the guys
haven't fixed it yes that's why I'm a

289
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,130
tying

290
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:42,250
too much about it another

291
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:46,040
a third vendor that we wanted to show of
course but when push who didn't

292
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,100
and reached an agreement with him

293
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,540
that's why this is it from my
presentation today

294
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:56,429
is my Twitter below where

295
00:17:56,429 --> 00:18:00,409
and with their questions please welcome

296
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:13,300
no questions at all really

297
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,779
great thanks

298
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:17,120
okay have a good day everyone
