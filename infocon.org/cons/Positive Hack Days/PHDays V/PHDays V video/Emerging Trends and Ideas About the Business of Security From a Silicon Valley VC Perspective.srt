everywhere you look invest and knowing
without any in week or something like

as if I am because I second that motion

jeff is coming to the house

is that criticized on Sharia again is
your guide Merkel's

31
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,930
alright networking services I was that I
as you all know

32
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,140
professional development group

33
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,170
really strains development kits

34
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,570
release schedules a professional
environment exists

35
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,750
for releasing babs and that

36
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:04,250
combat in that is a mess the mess that
we have is

37
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,460
CV ease alerts patch days

38
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,830
vendor days Microsoft days

39
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:15,140
Android is is a mess if I was the chief
security officer for a big

40
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,140
operation I would be going crazy right
now

41
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,569
if you look at Android there are over
2,000

42
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:25,650
parameters on the operating system which
can affect not only security

43
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,220
but integrity the system how can any one
person all

44
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,739
all these parameters and we have how
many different variations of Android

45
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:37,290
files companies have been founded

46
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,819
just the track Android variations thats
all they do

47
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:46,519
and the gulf front so what we're seeing
now is a geometric increase in attacks

48
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:50,130
if you see not only the number of
attacks but the quality of them

49
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,130
the most recent start I have from April

50
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,579
is that we reached a peak one a denial
of service attack

51
00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:01,700
being a 170 gigabits against one target
that's a lot

52
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:07,329
that's a lot guys and in addition to
that anti virus and signature based

53
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:08,010
approaches

54
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:13,170
it's not they don't work there are last
generation the threat has evolved beyond

55
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:17,359
so it's going to get a lot worse and we
as BC's look ahead

56
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:21,220
to see what is in the future and what is
in the future is

57
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,440
Internet of Things I every phrase in
Silicon Valley

58
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,560
is overused which phrase would you like
cloud

59
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,100
big data data science machine learning

60
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,389
deep learning a thousand phrases they
are overused

61
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:39,470
but we know that the major players

62
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,959
are all developing very quickly API's

63
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,269
and systems to develop millions

64
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:50,530
sensors so we know of companies such as
bits to

65
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,230
which is in Canada bits to routinely
managers eight million note networks

66
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,750
many of them they do proactive
monitoring

67
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,889
Internet of Things notes to see if
they're going to fail

68
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:05,139
they have dozens of customers now
multiply

69
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:09,510
dozens by millions with one company

70
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:14,260
so this is what's coming we're not ready
for this we're not ready for autonomous

71
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,310
communications

72
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:18,489
we're not ready for the fact that
unintended

73
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:20,040
first derivative

74
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,340
fax of a power line out a power line
disruption

75
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:28,040
affecting a hospital killing people
we're not ready and of course things

76
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,620
like programmable logic controllers made
in the 80's are still out there

77
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,000
and things like showdown on my friend 25
see

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,290
I was talking to a guy who knows way
more than me

79
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,500
about security and his name is Eric
Martin and Eric to

80
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,580
is the chief until recently was the
chief security officer of pay pal

81
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,250
e-bay and he certainly deals with
security

82
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,250
on my daily basis and what we're talking
about is

83
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,610
while all of us focus upon technology

84
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,170
as a solution for security issues the
real problem

85
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,180
from the corporate side is do you know
any company

86
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,670
which implements security as a

87
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:12,420
feature the company DNA how they operate
the company

88
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:16,380
how the everyday process and practice

89
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,880
information security I I don't know very
many

90
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,220
so what startup companies practice this
more

91
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,800
about that in a minute I'm going to
close at the end of this which companies

92
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,840
the worst security in the world you can
guess so what

93
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,390
Eric Martin says where's the company
responsible

94
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:37,330
where is the pre-planning the staging
because when someone is actually

95
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:41,020
inside the network and their savaging
and beating on you

96
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:45,300
is too late to make a plan and the wrong
guys to send

97
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,920
to solve the problem our engineering
guys they're like

98
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,180
all love you and me we look this really
a cool thing you know it's nice

99
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,240
meanwhile the information is sailing out
the door

100
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,320
the problem is not an engineering
problem

101
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,810
is one of public relations trust and
insurance

102
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,150
know companies deal with this well
except guys a plan

103
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,400
in advance so which startups help

104
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,689
company's plan non so here's an
opportunity

105
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:19,189
so the state of the industry is I see it
and a bunch of people who we we talk

106
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,919
frequently

107
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,519
and we lament security is that anti
virus is really a dead and dying

108
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,429
offering

109
00:06:25,429 --> 00:06:29,709
but it's curious if you look where the
anti-virus people are today

110
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:34,179
the every anti-virus company is
scrambling to position them stalls

111
00:06:34,179 --> 00:06:37,589
position themselves as a guy take care
of

112
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:42,229
speak sponsored security I'm not gonna
say

113
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:46,939
APT all but it's a way for them to
evolve their companies to survive

114
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:51,069
because they cannot survive just
antivirus but the guys who are winning

115
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:51,519
now

116
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:56,399
like fire I other guys are the guys who
have the most number of nodes

117
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,259
across the net at pairing points to
collect data

118
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:03,899
so the guys were in data collection in
real time

119
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:07,299
those are the guys are gonna win because
signatures don't work

120
00:07:07,299 --> 00:07:10,769
you have to collect the threat in real
time and get it to your customers

121
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:14,139
so what we think is going to be very
important is a real time

122
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:17,189
versus the previous forensic approach

123
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:21,419
to solving problems forensics you don't
have enough time to figure it out

124
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:25,499
the other thing that we are the seas are
hugely interested

125
00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:29,819
is behavioral analytics of people
network traffic

126
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:34,469
packet flows and the idea here is to
build heuristic tools

127
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:38,179
the learn to a degree maybe with some
human assistance

128
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:41,849
what is going on and then to publish
that

129
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:45,549
out quickly until you get a tool that
can learn what is right

130
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:48,999
you're not going to know what is wrong
you cannot know what is wrong by

131
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:49,849
signature

132
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:54,609
you cannot know by many different ways
how do you visualize this

133
00:07:54,609 --> 00:07:58,109
who does security visualization tools
know all

134
00:07:58,109 --> 00:08:01,630
so with that

135
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,790
on let me give you an idea of what's not
working I'll

136
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:08,840
and please if anyone who works on these
things it is not my intent to insult you

137
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,350
over my years in engineering I worked on
many things that were

138
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:16,620
total failures and I do not have those
on my resume so

139
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,760
what doesn't work for the same crew full
disk encryption

140
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,900
ridiculous I mean the No it it gets in
the way of the user the user doesn't use

141
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,140
it

142
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:29,010
fire also face the wrong way you know
what

143
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:32,910
summer the large fire all manufacturers
asked us for to going fine for them

144
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:37,080
as companies who bills micro analytics

145
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,950
into a router or firewall think
OpenStack

146
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:45,220
who builds analytics Rai on a
microsecond basis

147
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,260
can figure out what is requesting
traffic being switched to a particular

148
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,340
location

149
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:55,810
or particular port happy or particular
connection physical connection

150
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:59,120
nobody we want this on the microsecond
basis

151
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,130
not we have now not S&P ridiculous up

152
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:06,270
don't think it's not working as fiddling
around with permissions

153
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,770
I'd argue that once the organization
gets beyond about 15 people

154
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:14,620
what happens is to every organization

155
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,010
they merely open up the granularity are
the rules

156
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:21,070
so you're either in engineering or
you're in legal these are the rules

157
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:25,120
all that certainly didn't help the other
thing that doesn't help

158
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,990
is look at all these acronyms on the
last line

159
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:32,160
do you think did any of those mean
anything to you guys

160
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,640
they don't mean a lot to me but to a guy
who is in

161
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,980
management of the company he can tell
the CEO

162
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,339
book you know I have followed this I
have all these standards

163
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:48,100
bad guys say great standards I don't pay
attention to any others

164
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,899
job you know but huge industry in
creating the standards that mean nothing

165
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:57,279
absolutely not except when you get your

166
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,579
certification are so it took me a

167
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:04,610
a while to put the slide together
because after I stole it from somebody

168
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,790
else's presentation I had to update it
and these little

169
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,829
the full time you just take forever to
copy

170
00:10:10,829 --> 00:10:15,660
so be are issue here's from a PC
perspective

171
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:20,920
there are thousands of companies out
there and the question for you guys

172
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,620
if you're starting a company or you're
thinking about a technology is

173
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,170
how do I get noticed how do I build
something

174
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:32,019
that is important how do all these guys

175
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:35,500
how do I compete against all and the
answer is to be

176
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,889
specific so

177
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:42,180
let me give you a chichi I am a big
believer in

178
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,810
in feces for dummies like me so what we

179
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,930
pairs I'll tell you how to get this is
like one of those

180
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:52,470
you know entrepreneur get them going
speeches

181
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:57,240
this is what we use to evaluate
companies that come in the door

182
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,600
number one and the solvent

183
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,940
order think about this in your mind the
solvent order

184
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,260
when you're making a pitch 2pcs do this

185
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,790
in this order I guarantee it will work
number one

186
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:15,470
what is a team are they world-class guys
have they done this before

187
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:19,370
do they want to work 90 hours a week
sure that's why they're there

188
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:22,970
but are they world-class guys they don't
have to be famous

189
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:26,370
that's not what we're asking for rescue
for guys for

190
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,510
world-class skills that's what we're
seeking and

191
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:34,300
the team is everything because if we
find a company that has a

192
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,300
John team crap the car

193
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,430
week putting a hundred million dollars
and it's going to fail

194
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,980
I know the very first delighted as a PC

195
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,050
$72 million dollars when

196
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:50,209
and on the last day we said to the
engineering guys

197
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,459
you're not really making what you said
your gonna make right and they said

198
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:56,510
all in all now so so

199
00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:00,420
you know without a good team forget the
second thing is

200
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:04,709
what is the technology that you're using
are you doing something new

201
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:08,839
is it something that is based upon
computer science as opposed to

202
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,540
PHP in my single is it something that is
really

203
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,980
important it hasn't algorithmic based
approach can you prove it

204
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,720
because if the technology

205
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,820
is com you have a much steeper

206
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:28,370
row to go up to prove that is unique and
no one else can copy this

207
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:32,060
because certainly people will number
three

208
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,200
how big is the market is it

209
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,529
fifty million $500 million five billion

210
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:42,160
$50 billion and how are you going to get
the market

211
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,370
this is the question that trips up
technology guys

212
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:49,640
a lot which is I say the market is fifty
billion dollars

213
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,149
well what data support your conclusion
okay

214
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:57,480
you know the downside I'm saying the
market is fifty billion dollars is

215
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,160
how much money is it going to take you
to put your company's name

216
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,560
in front of fifty thousand companies
spending a hundred thousand dollars

217
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,730
each just in one region to get you
noticed

218
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,220
so be careful love making up a market
size that is unrealistic

219
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,600
because the first part goes through your
head species is

220
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,690
I'll huge worldwide market do you know
how much it cost to establish

221
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:25,079
a national brand one brand in the United
States

222
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:29,940
take a guess six hundred million dollars
in advertising you're not going to get

223
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,470
there

224
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:33,880
so the answer is choose a market wisely

225
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,089
analyze it wisely and then prove to us
that you have an approach

226
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:42,839
which makes s if you spend all of your
very expensive PC money

227
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:46,670
which is your ownership in the company
if you spend that money

228
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:49,800
and you give it to to Eric and the guys
over Google

229
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,910
you made them even wealthier you make
the King Richard Nana

230
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,040
you need to spend the money to make you
richer

231
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,870
there it is 20 rich so the last thing
that's also again in order

232
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:05,090
is finance and the rule that we have is

233
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:09,830
you can always find the money always too
many guys are worried

234
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:13,110
I'm russian guy this guy I'm not

235
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,640
it doesn't matter if you have a
world-class team with world-class

236
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,680
technology

237
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,940
you know where you want to sell it and
how finance

238
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,040
is always there the question for you to
ask yourself is

239
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,300
if I bring investors to help me can they
do it

240
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,360
can they help me or they just what we
call

241
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,420
of 52 a bag of potatoes that is a PC

242
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:40,170
term for when you walk in the board
meeting all the guys are sitting at the

243
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:40,620
border

244
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,320
table and 6070 like this right

245
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,200
that's really helping the company a lot
right I have one guy twice it on a board

246
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,540
with

247
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:54,170
he prepares his admin print out his
emails

248
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:58,020
and he read his emails paper through the
whole board meeting

249
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:02,000
what you want is someone who when you
say you know what

250
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,339
I am missing really good de parts guy

251
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:08,620
I need a VP of their boss he says all

252
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,870
I can go call in copper of he's not that
every venture is but

253
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,220
you know he was a Netflix he thought he
is the God about I can call

254
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,790
just way that's the guy you want so what
I am urging you guys

255
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:22,690
is you all need to do due diligence

256
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:26,050
on us we can plan your due diligence on
you

257
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,730
you know it's no problem we can do that
forever but you guys

258
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:33,380
when you ask your PC for money you need
to ask the PC

259
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,700
tell us what's good about you your
success

260
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,070
what are you good at which areas do you
not invest

261
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:44,280
I don't ask them if they're stupid
because no BC will tell you he is stupid

262
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,170
they also you I'm genius enough but
realistically

263
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:52,990
you guys need to do your due diligence
are us the other thing that we see a

264
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,010
species is

265
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:57,620
when you take money series a

266
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,020
we call it the blue smoke around

267
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,880
use the first money you get to prove
that it doesn't catch fire

268
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:09,120
when assets on we had a were designing a
new processor years ago

269
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,590
and a new instruction showed up and it
was call

270
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:16,390
BH see a and no one could figure out

271
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:20,820
in a big engineering meeting white that
and of course all being engineers know

272
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,190
on

273
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:24,670
had the guts to stand up and say I have
no idea what that is

274
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:28,510
well I hope construction in the
instruction set until one guy put his

275
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,320
hand up and said

276
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,010
who I know what it is its branch Hall
and catch fire

277
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:36,190
and so what you need to prove a series a

278
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:39,450
is you do not let the blue smoke out it
works

279
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:42,990
that's all that's all you should plan
for which there is a

280
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,990
don't go crazy you don't want fifty
million dollar sales

281
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:51,190
use the series B much more money to hire
sales grow install these guys

282
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,450
you serious a to prove it works because
if it works

283
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:58,230
and you have five customers who are
willing to sign up

284
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:02,160
raising additional money is easy don't
worry about Prop

285
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,900
take risks usually the first mover wins

286
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,730
how many you guys know how many search
companies are out there right now

287
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:14,209
approximately about 255 last time I
looked

288
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:19,200
there were two that on 97 percent of the
market about the other 153

289
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,150
I'll it's gonna be endorsing so

290
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:26,620
first-mover be a first mover don't the
second

291
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:30,660
so I'm sorta I could not split this up
but

292
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:35,020
on the gold rules do something with
customer needs and kept you from cells

293
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,650
solve their pain ask the customer what's
killing you so

294
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:42,100
use recent work around doctor to last
that whatever

295
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,370
to do rap it's been up the ONS there's a
lot of work around this this

296
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:49,820
research going on a prickly about
microseconds been up since such

297
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,380
which you can use for isolation on a per
connection bassist things like

298
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,490
connection establishment

299
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:59,290
lotta work there do continuous look at
continuous randomized test

300
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,720
if you look at what a the guys at
Netflix did

301
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,040
single sweeping is toast doesn't work
anymore but what Netflix does

302
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,630
they have what they call simeon or
monkey army they have a

303
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,660
they have process the run around the
network and they

304
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:17,290
clip of network connections they break
databases they attacked things they

305
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:21,560
to try to kill and they call things like
the security market the chaos monkey

306
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,590
automation of bad environment

307
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:29,920
is a good thing try to do that the other
thing we see that we look at a lot was

308
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,930
multi-tenant crypto for

309
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:36,050
a muppet 10 clout environments

310
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:40,100
where somebody's managing the keys to
make sure that this guy's data doesn't

311
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,130
end up with those

312
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,870
very few guys do that on very few guys

313
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:48,860
can prove their commingling in other
words is my data

314
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,060
mixed with his go to Amazon call-up

315
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,530
Bill Haas who is the vice president of
Amazon Web Services and say

316
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:59,540
can you prove to me that my data is not
commingled with

317
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,290
Juniper's and the answers

318
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:07,630
now so who does that so the whole thing
that we're really big on

319
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:11,760
these next two points is behavioral
analytics and behavioral analysis

320
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,380
not only human to human machine the
machine for flow

321
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:20,020
that is the hottest thing right now a
company that I'll cover just sex just

322
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,460
got a hundred million dollars

323
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:25,680
to do this anybody who knows how to
handle statistics but collect

324
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,460
in a heuristic way whether you use any
type VI it's up to you

325
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,270
what's going on in the network without
prior knowledge

326
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:38,360
that's AP opportunity also we're looking
at unstructured data analytics

327
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,800
but also people are now using things
like this and yr for eventual

328
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,820
consistency as a security tool

329
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,550
was kind of interesting which is it was
inconsistent here

330
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:50,680
I made it consistent over there but
something changed

331
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,520
haha so the kind of using an inverse
version of Cassandra

332
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,800
kinda slow an interesting kinda slow but
still interesting

333
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,710
don't think it's really changing as if
you look inside a big data center

334
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:05,610
you know where the Internet ans at the
top tracks which was at

335
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,760
what's even more important to us is

336
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,500
everybody's going in memory right
whether it's Hadoop guy

337
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,020
words somebody is using great game that
while these guys who

338
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:20,360
is putting things in memory on no
packets come out on the liar

339
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,780
over the whole flap last year with
doctor and how the fact that you could

340
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,280
essentially go from one doctor container
to another

341
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,930
nope there was no containment well
that's been fixed

342
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:34,030
but certainly not fixed across all the
VM environments so who does it in every

343
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:34,630
file

344
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:38,930
dozen memory behavioral analytics so to
go to give you an idea of the market

345
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:39,560
sisal

346
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,900
any of these things the last point is
just data leakage protection

347
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,750
was a $665 million dollar market in the
US law

348
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:52,360
one country one-year one prop so you can
hit it big with you in just one

349
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,670
really well so sorry last opportunities
are

350
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:01,490
translating CV's insert notices of
something that people can use

351
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,560
are also what's going on with her
traffic I

352
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:09,090
Internet of Things traffic tunnels arnal
and of course with all the work on

353
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:12,170
on bio since the kinda some Rosa I

354
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,270
infection of from where on motherboards

355
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:18,680
was working on that and the last thing
is

356
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,820
I'll most mobile network operators the
stay us

357
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,940
are all ipv6 the only way to keep these

358
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:31,090
numbers and devices are who does ipv6
analysis really well

359
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:34,140
I mean I know somebody from the you

360
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,100
total like ski right you can use to go
bash on ipv6 but

361
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,360
who specialize in ipv6 security for
mobile operators

362
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,190
why certainly were there only a couple
billion people use in the door

363
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:49,970
things out there that's another huge
opportunity so

364
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:54,370
here some guys doing interesting stuff
automated code analysis points straight

365
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:56,100
to the bad code so guys who are

366
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,910
geniuses can fix it company called tin
foil think that is a

367
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:03,700
step beyond nasa spot with pointer back
into the system

368
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,990
to the calls that are make it better
with about stuff I

369
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:11,020
tana people are looking at are using
watch talks encryption rest

370
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:14,050
all documents selected the crib Shin
with

371
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:17,290
are selective blowing away at the keys
so that you know any time you pull it

372
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:18,110
back to

373
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:22,720
realistic report back you can make it go
away even if they're on the old viewer

374
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,340
for document so that you can as you read
it zooms in closer and closer some guy

375
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,080
can't look around across social

376
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,080
pretty clever are secure

377
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,740
and that's what stocks we look at
Verona's secure private cloud

378
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:39,260
multi-tenant they look at unstructured
data kinda good guys

379
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:42,510
on this company IntraLinks they do

380
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:46,610
secure enterprise collaboration and
they're used huge numbers by the drug

381
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:47,220
discovery

382
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,330
us the amount the amount of money that's
involved in things like drug discovery

383
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:51,600
is

384
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,770
tenzin tens of billions of dollars so
keeping the collaboration between

385
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,200
experimentalists

386
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,620
researchers and drug trial operators all
secret

387
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,690
while they're all out talk that's a big
deal they do one thing

388
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:07,630
on this is the company that received a
couple hundred million dollars

389
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:11,190
alluvial so what alluvial does is
microsite mentation

390
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,400
networks this special breaks a net into
little tiny chunks

391
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,410
and they such as a traffic cannot flow
between these chances

392
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:20,930
allies can and to keep track of who's
going across which shop

393
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:26,130
very nice are couple guys were doing
heuristic not signature-based of

394
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:30,120
silence and the last two or behavioral
analytics guys to look at

395
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,530
verical Fort scale okay

396
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:38,070
so I when folks here asked me to do this
talk

397
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:41,550
I actually put me in that the title
would be VC

398
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:44,900
perspective our security opportunities
Sorkin Valley

399
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,540
and who has the worst security in the
world but

400
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:52,710
backed out left out so I apologize but I
will now entertain you

401
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:57,500
with what I have run across who has the
worst security in the world

402
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,570
take a guess it's not

403
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:04,180
it should be obvious it's a start up

404
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:08,250
they have no money to spend on security
it's laughable

405
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,330
actually crying it's more like it so

406
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:15,810
do you say these words do you of course
the source code is on

407
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:19,340
every machine all the time how silly it
even ask

408
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,500
the source code is everywhere mum while

409
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,590
okay I am an engineer I do not maintain

410
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,340
servers I do not maintain a.w.s

411
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,890
that is for sysadmin guys we have none
of them's

412
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:37,750
go away passwords on access points are
black

413
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:41,150
if you go to Fry's Electronics in Palo
Alto

414
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:46,720
the block before price please drop by
with your aircraft whatever you want you

415
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,820
don't then you realize

416
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,550
I don't meet aircraft prison AP with no
password

417
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:54,810
and you know I'll look I can go mount I
can go out and a smile

418
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:58,530
the service all source code nice on

419
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:03,370
logs I mean a lot i'm too busy I'm an
engineer I'm writing coal blocks away

420
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:07,660
I'm here's one that I love engineering
will rebel if they don't have root

421
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,800
access to everything

422
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,860
the woman who rhonda mclean

423
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,180
went into Bank of America to revitalize
their security

424
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:19,840
take a guess how many firewalls

425
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,200
and Cisco routers they had at about 1400

426
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,320
just in the US guess how many engineers
had passwords of 1400 all

427
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,530
K on we have had machines physically
stolen et cetera

428
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:37,140
out we also the latest one is we have
guys they would you like the password to

429
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,810
RRR git repo

430
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:42,090
of all over source code all true sounds
great

431
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:46,540
lot crisis craze or even more astounding
is a dumb

432
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:50,920
PCs put $20 billion dollars in and wash
the product being stolen

433
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:55,320
if I was a bad guy wouldn't I wait till
the day that you release the product and

434
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:55,770
said

435
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:59,880
ok great I can now snapshot the repo and
I've got a twenty million dollar

436
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,620
investment

437
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,980
for nothing which is exactly what is
happening exactly

438
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:08,430
so look at the second point for the ball
about a month ago

439
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:11,670
in the New York Times I don't have a
laser pointer but I can point

440
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:15,570
I do better than a laser pointer his
finger so

441
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:18,770
this was a month ago 3 percent

442
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:21,780
US crossed American gross domestic
product

443
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,830
$14 trillion dollars is being stolen the
Internet

444
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:30,140
for trades secret theft okay

445
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:34,460
it's a big number and guess who's
helping

446
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,940
startups so please you wanna

447
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:41,660
don't be one of those startups up I was
involved in one

448
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:45,160
like this the bad I physically broke n

449
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,740
this is great and he picked up the
server with twenty million dollars for

450
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,610
the source code

451
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,690
all the test harnesses and all at the
bar although

452
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:56,130
for years to maintain instrument and be
but carried it up

453
00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:00,010
he got the wrong machine we are safe

454
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:03,190
everybody was like yes this is great
that guy was a doofus

455
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:06,870
problem was they said you know out all
our friends guys a doofus

456
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:11,010
came back two nights later got the right
one twenty million bucks

457
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:16,000
out the door so do you think these guys
got funded the second time around

458
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,300
I don't think so so let me give you guys
piece by stress is a

459
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,570
plight advice if you come to the Seas

460
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:27,420
and you say I've got a great idea and
you do those four things you know we've

461
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,310
got the team the technology to market

462
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:33,410
the finance locked up and to say to the
VC's and I care a little

463
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:37,720
even a little bit about my security the
average PC or probably say

464
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,190
while but some guys will say hey I got

00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:06,610
hold on what's up patoski police
discretion to cook

470
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:11,140

00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,910
I'd yes can you hear me im

473
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:24,840
can you hear me OK champ rate could you
please tell us how about the latest

474
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,920
startups

475
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:31,210
model Iveco where almost capital
invested why is a selective

476
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:40,820
those very startups and was the result

477
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:45,039
startups in reach I'll miss capital has
a

478
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:49,770
investors money YZ invested in these
startups and

479
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:53,039
how their goals sure arm

480
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,649
would you like a particular category or
just those ones that have been massively

481
00:28:56,649 --> 00:28:59,610
successful I leave the failures out just
about to

482
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:03,090
you sink their the the most the best

483
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:07,990
or do our you like them well I will only
tell you the ones I'm on the board of

484
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,029
because they're the best

485
00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:13,799
got the we have invested since 2007

486
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:18,500
we are in our second fun now we had $75
million dollars approximately in

487
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,740
on line with AT&T X quick several
companies

488
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:25,350
like that in fun one and fun too we're
doing

489
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:28,360
a number of other companies and our
model is to take

490
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,140
to find guys here to do development but
we will build the company out

491
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,010
internationally

492
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:37,350
in the US because it is easier to do
that and so some other companies that we

493
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,649
are invested in

494
00:29:38,649 --> 00:29:42,970
one company is an Internet of Things
company they build

495
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:46,590
LED streetlights and eat street light
has a Linux

496
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:50,020
single board computer and up to 30
sensors on each flight

497
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,260
we take all the data back from all 30
sensors

498
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:56,649
we bring that into our cloud and then up

499
00:29:56,649 --> 00:30:00,190
developers write applications against
that so the light

500
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:04,200
pays for the computer the reduction in
electricity pays for the buying the

501
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:04,750
whole

502
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:08,890
thing the fact that you can write maps
that actually provide some value to

503
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:09,470
people

504
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:12,559
we've been surprised at the diversity of
at

505
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,770
a success is defined by I could never
guess that someone would do that

506
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:20,100
and so for example with

507
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,980
holes areas of cities covered with
street lights which have sensors

508
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:27,830
up to 30 sensors temperature video
vibration audio

509
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:33,120
wind direction wind speed are one guy
wrote a nap

510
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,210
it does free parking spot detection with
no reflectors or anything else

511
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:41,520
on the street another guy said he was
really worried about snow

512
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,750
accumulation during winter so the snow
did not collapse the roofs

513
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,910
outbuildings so he wrote

514
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:51,830
at to measure snow death are railroad

515
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:55,710
wrote an application because the lights
are in there really are to detect

516
00:30:55,710 --> 00:31:01,080
leaking oil course so I'm not smart
enough to think if any of these

517
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:05,110
that's one company on another company
that

518
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:08,860
we're doing is doing in memory a

519
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:12,000
I do I actually it's an in memory

520
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
a database which has to do and

521
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,400
sequel interfaces called great game and
they

522
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,080
I said under me something like an
analytic package and they make that I

523
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,150
could run up to a thousand times faster

524
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:27,260
so this is what Apple uses to do the
analytics

525
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,970
on me logistics up the iTunes Store

526
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:33,690
because they're running hundreds of
millions I don't know if you know this

527
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:34,180
but

528
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:38,260
the iTunes Store obviously is multiple
instances around the world

529
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,590
and they're doing hundreds of millions
of transactions a day

530
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:45,260
are moving new new content across all
these

531
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:48,500
our data centers and they actually have
to schedule a

532
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,950
so they get the popular stuff in first
before the joke goes in

533
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:55,940
so that's why other companies so we
invest in a wide range of companies

534
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:59,760
but our interests are in things that
enterprise

535
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,050
sees as a pain you're solving security

536
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:07,080
anything to do with networking anything
to do with analytics

537
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,280
really big on analytics we also
companies

538
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,740
to back up in an awful way so we have a

539
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,980
rock wide range we do not saying no to
anybody

540
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,310
the things we say no two are alike and
I'm not being funny just the other day

541
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:25,070
we saw yet another flying car you know

542
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:28,820
you drive down the road to stop put the
wings on either side in the match

543
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,840
you know we say no to stuff like that

544
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,080
because but generally look at i so does
that answer your

545
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,540
ok great any other any other questions
come

546
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:46,230
yeah

547
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:49,200
a thank you talk I Owen task

548
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,610
if your fund invests in any because
related technologists and

549
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:56,800
is it generally a hot topic in this Sept

550
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,150
thank you yes it is a hot topic are

551
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:03,690
you know it's kinda funny there to class
is a venture capital firm in Silicon

552
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,210
Valley

553
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:07,830
there's those guys who don't have five
billion dollars to invest

554
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:12,400
and those that do and those that do put
a billion dollars into a RBI and

555
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,560
the or into something of that nature

556
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:21,230
and everyone else's I wish the guys were
investing in bed going right now

557
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:26,660
are those big guys because in the stock
market or any type of market

558
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:31,160
you try to create the market first then
you try to populate the market with

559
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,990
transactions

560
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:37,030
so the pic going guys are trying very
hard now to type it going to some

561
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:40,180
external metric not so much currency

562
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:43,790
but they want the stamp of approval that
they can trade it into

563
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:46,850
some legal trading system and the pretty
close

564
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:50,310
there are a couple people are pretty
close the question is then what

565
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:54,250
does it turn into another credit card
does it get re regulated

566
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:57,750
we don't know but there's some guys like
and recent than others

567
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:01,270
who have a specific fund dedicated to
just pickle

568
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:04,970
and that's a pretty serious bat if you
have just

569
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:08,260
bit going related investments you're
putting tens of millions of dollars

570
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,060
behind it

571
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:13,550
there's huge interest and the interest
really comes from the fact that this is

572
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,520
the first time you can have a
distributed

573
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,680
on double declining balance sheet across
the entire network

574
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:23,510
and it's usable not only for bitcoins
for anything else for you want to

575
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:28,200
track record repudiate any transaction
so the distributed nature is what's got

576
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,280
a lot of people interested

577
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,560
anybody

578
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,780
and yes

579
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,730
could be a say in your opinion pote I

580
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:43,000
T what is the sentiment both ills is

581
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,270
the nets market in both

582
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:50,220
or its Iran to tho 10 years

583
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:54,590
you know it is current marketing
bullshit not next marketing bullshit

584
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:58,380
discover so on thank you for the

585
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:02,340
for a question the reason is as soon as
we call in a new term

586
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,460
by the way I tell each company I will
with that we work with

587
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,530
quick before anything else make a new

588
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:12,630
term like Center metric network
performance

589
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:16,520
what does that mean I don't know but
marketing guys can make huge noise with

590
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,600
on what the Internet things really is is
a whole

591
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,360
that all the sensors that are out there
can somehow be stitched together

592
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:28,500
and their two sides this there's all the
stuff that's out there now

593
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,200
that you're gonna have to grapple
because its legacy stuff

594
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:36,630
thermostat thermostat was never designed
to be networked with thermostat in India

595
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:40,150
come on there's always like to see stuff
thunders

596
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:43,390
the forward-looking stuff the design to
be networked

597
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:47,350
using something like low-power look are
Bluetooth which is a enormous interest

598
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,050
to people

599
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:51,550
and that's the stuff they were
interested in

600
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:55,880
we think the people who are going to try
to unify everything with massive API's

601
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,790
in all arrested

602
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:01,430
they're gonna fail the reason is you can
there's just too much stuff out there

603
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:02,770
that's like to see stuff

604
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:07,630
but if you choose a segment say like our
company sense

605
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:11,640
they do streetlights that's the IRT they
do

606
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,550
and they happened outfit all kinds of
sensors over that street light

607
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:18,600
but they're not trying to do I O T
inside cars

608
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,650
they're not trying to do it inside
houses their only trying to collect data

609
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:25,950
about their customers traffic have any
type

610
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:29,940
and then allow people to write ups so
that argument that I'm going to make

611
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,920
about IIT

612
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,650
is that the real opportunity is not
trying to break

613
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:38,860
is to make your mind gets talked about
how I write an all-inclusive API

614
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:42,970
that I force the entire world to adopt
you guys are smart you been there huh

615
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:46,240
under times never going to happen never
never-never

616
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,720
you know never so the question is can
you write

617
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,970
nati that addresses one class of device

618
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:58,210
that will cause people to say you know
I'll

619
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:01,520
you smart guys I need to go talk to them

620
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:06,080
because they conclusively figured out
phenol the characteristics that device

621
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,240
so I'm a big fan of this company bit
stew in

622
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,720
in Vancouver Canada because the devices
they chose to manage

623
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,380
had to deal with were smart are meters
they're not

624
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,550
soccer Spring Networks they don't
collect the data they go out on the

625
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,380
network and say

626
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:24,920
no the sensors look like they're
degrading probably about

627
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,470
lifelike about national were connection
what's the trouble

628
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:31,580
so there's a lot of opportunity not
unnecessarily doing

629
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:35,160
the Internet of Things as opposed to
monitoring securing

630
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:40,140
analyzing so we we pose a simple
question two guys who come in with it.

631
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:44,850
proposals to us what's the battery life
and how do you know when it's dead

632
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:50,590
or I know if that does not talking to me
anymore who's going to go to northern

633
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,250
Alaska

634
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:55,310
change the battery did you did you
decide to do have the thing notify us

635
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,620
maybe before it was dead

636
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:59,640
that's an excellent idea next company so

637
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:04,480
we look at IO ti really as separate
pools

638
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,270
devices the FAW the the hope that
they're going to be unified

639
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:12,020
some ground thing will never so okay

640
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:15,240
any other questions on okay thanks
