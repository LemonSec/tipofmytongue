1
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,150
index

2
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:14,570
really how we included

3
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,689
all yah you know and a procedure

4
00:00:17,689 --> 00:00:23,040
hugh him on this picture

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,340
this usually is to illustrate saint

6
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:32,110
well technically this is what probably
looks like because we are net tech giant

7
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,440
only by a smaller companies although one
philosophical mention p

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,080
the train differently because each and
every company no

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,670
you patient with us we years young dicks
acquire

10
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,309
are years missing all the possible that
makes this much stronger who

11
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:54,280
innovations explain from the outside I
don't feel comfortable telling me about

12
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:54,920
all the

13
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,820
by want me his you

14
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,620
because I realize that it's probably not
the first time now to shop for companies

15
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:08,850
you was the Wiley if I announced a
different okay

16
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,270
such yes optimizing security departments
in corporations and would be more people

17
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,530
listening

18
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,939
you company but this is something you
know a

19
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:22,020
who wanted to talk about for quite some
time

20
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,320
and I think that we've been able to
design it phiri realignment

21
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,600
cum laude ghosts on the security

22
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,159
open service in you'll have to tell me
about it because we have

23
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:36,210
was significant experience in this
respect

24
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,390
mu lost year and we close swirl to use
another soul alt

25
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,700
Young Turks buying we have a long tilson
to those answers seem

26
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,770
please no nurse many our acquisitions
were pretty lotion and me

27
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,130
no brought their infrastructure into our
offices

28
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:58,049
lotsa there were lots and lots of
problems we experience

29
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:05,170
possible his things we learnt are

30
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,220
let me explain what we are not going to
discuss

31
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,640
bro more who when

32
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,060
yet is important you scenes where

33
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,180
mostly by startups working

34
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,000
we will care about compliance first and
foremost

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,680
say if we're buying company we want to
make sure they it's compliant

36
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,360
with Eastern requirements such as PCI
DSS

37
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,560
you who you

38
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,910
Islam who we

39
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:45,160
this be in time to put it differently

40
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,420
than we usually don't haven't seen this

41
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,769
in making sure that the startup way
water

42
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:54,870
me sleepy seeing a DSS requirements

43
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,410
we don't buy office answer is
structurally

44
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:03,040
really really well I buildings with

45
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,130
is which is physically relic eight
little to your own office

46
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,690
and get off this all over the country we
give them

47
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,019
our it with me is our infrastructure our
network

48
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:19,140
so we'll have to marry restrictions he

49
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,630
he simply doesn't happen that we were
together and

50
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,700
nobility with their own systems their

51
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,810
telephoning didn't roll IT platforms

52
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,959
with this is something we're not going
to discuss

53
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,950
you know in my internal rehearsals my
colleagues told me and nobody would be

54
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,630
listening to: sry say that

55
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,820
is still sitting stay more comfortable

56
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,859
companies week lawyer

57
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:49,100
usually small yeah lost business tenders

58
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,489
however week integrate them considerably

59
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:57,069
in our infrastructure which means that
they will have

60
00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:04,910
defects 10 overall security just like
any other company and only if

61
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,530
what you mean

62
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:10,250
love very may even blind to the
beginning

63
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,560
teeth on years ago wouldn't really
grosses

64
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,380
room and a witch's balls companies we
liked we try to integrate SEM

65
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,709
know we had seen all the legal
department

66
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:26,520
the tax accountants the chart but that
was it

67
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,600
after the dance historians looking at
proper business process we hired in a

68
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,650
money manager

69
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:39,979
who was you want above all deals like
that and and here she's formally in

70
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,300
charge of reliably

71
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:47,139
transactions think it was late 2013
though we realize so we're seeing

72
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:53,410
EFL steals and we're not really worried
about them probably so we could not get

73
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,419
involved

74
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:58,370
yes to the optional extent

75
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,389
me so we suggested we he's Idaho

76
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:06,139
Bros should explain what kinda fun to be
usually buy we either acquired

77
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,120
technologies

78
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,280
NoHo clientele him

79
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,289
could be even suppliers who are buying
say a logistics company

80
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:21,370
you see can make connections boilers to
colleges so the company we believe could

81
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,750
make in this folder

82
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,520
secondly when buying software coat

83
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,380
sometimes like somebody else scolds
don't want design our own from scratch

84
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,979
see want to integrate something kills on
the DL stint

85
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:41,180
you engulfed in total are you something

86
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,960
its Misskelley like their collision

87
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,200
all the way up to a little bit so close

88
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,979
will buy it seems you

89
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:56,169
it happens sometimes into

90
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:59,710
still we don't like the cold

91
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:03,250
saying your example we acquired team

92
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:07,570
were modeled openly in working for us
well

93
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:11,150
in a rare cases week or friends sludge

94
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,670
about you

95
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,800
good whenever Bali brands

96
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,200
without Hills delivered by sea

97
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,550
I'll to go to you we free shipping you
know the impression that is well known

98
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,310
we don't want to lose the clientele that
is loyal to this particular brands

99
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,720
same goes King Arms he this he

100
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,800
you'll

101
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,990
but says almost body startups

102
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:43,840
it's pretty clear that this security
scanners will be

103
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,790
relax who see most cases the people

104
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:53,620
goal for the year cheapest most
functional technically don't care about

105
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,880
security they have too many things

106
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,330
only hands i won although oceans
straight away they didn't care about

107
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,640
securities so the

108
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,090
voluble cold lol usual

109
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,850
on their you this is a problem for us

110
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:15,520
well indexes theory employees both
internally and externally

111
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,480
know if I'll number so small companies
start-ups

112
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,470
the do not necessarily want

113
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,690
to become boats were choice a company
like Young's

114
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:31,930
in well we hate bureaucracy just let you
guys deal with me

115
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:36,430
bureaucracy me a large corporation so
there is something store hours whole

116
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,070
lake

117
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:41,720
polish previously your gas resources you
need it

118
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,960
just by talking to the person at the
next table

119
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,790
will have bad knees being essentially
you will need to go through a lengthy

120
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,020
approval pros

121
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:55,770
yeah people often don't appreciate its

122
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,889
the well

123
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:03,969
me who have to sometimes teams are
available to it

124
00:08:03,969 --> 00:08:07,379
you know it is a serious issue for us
yet

125
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:10,389
when using what you said witness

126
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:13,819
we want our systems to be well protect

127
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:17,050
but we also want our teams will be
helping

128
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:21,900
the case that spurred guarantees who
have any new girls

129
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,550
in well if the security department is
not

130
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,120
polls who

131
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,469
his only

132
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:36,789
the security department will be alt

133
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:40,990
Hunan chili would they usually have just
like this

134
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:45,040
oh you know we have a new service he
should be available from our data center

135
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,640
strategy

136
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,800
more sorry you've got to tell me about
that who

137
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,269
station want

138
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:55,649
only could be even worse we you

139
00:08:55,649 --> 00:09:00,040
for example it already broadcast where
already delivering the service and then

140
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,990
it turns out is

141
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,940
bucky people are complaining all in no
civilized

142
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,470
all this the way it was handled

143
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,870
because week where lots and lots of
teams polos

144
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:15,730
they will have in the impact on our
services and infrastructure

145
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,660
so we came up with release simple short

146
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,190
graceful know what can it sounds

147
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,090
or a small project will require

148
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:33,360
young extenders oil small things but we
believe in

149
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,240
full integration I know all mistresses
torture

150
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,430
exchange deter this means i win needs

151
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,570
and highly reliable integration

152
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:48,380
you who seem to which means

153
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,420
that a particular service fee adding CEO

154
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,750
portfolio you can undermine

155
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,440
the security I would Jesus with people
standing

156
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,730
who is it candy tin Myo whose

157
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:08,750
yes on obviously if you have highly
vulnerable service

158
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:13,000
you can yes it's as a that Israel attack
at our number

159
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,380
for example know if he yes all terrible
service

160
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,880
also process demands

161
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,850
more private data than

162
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:32,390
this information its public this will
tarnish the reputation young X

163
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:35,960
up so we service information security
people

164
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:40,600
months the new hole you know limit the
yeah it sounds simple right

165
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:47,540
you with up well

166
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,790
yes several I Z is total

167
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,860
we couldn't everything

168
00:10:53,860 --> 00:11:01,350
restaurant scratch also give you the
full story

169
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,930
I'll tell it stages of clinton's you

170
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:09,110
cool

171
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:13,620
you can text you

172
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:17,180
since we have a single him and a
miniature

173
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,640
it's easy for us yes well we had to be

174
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,210
can't help but look at this wrong person
you

175
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:28,580
he since he's in charge overall M&A
transactions

176
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:33,130
by talking to him to make sure we learn
about them

177
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:37,340
ahead of time as well he

178
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,570
the so we were lucky we didn't alter

179
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,910
of to negotiate with the whole company
since

180
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:47,520
this part of our operations hopefully
centralized

181
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,350
yet when and then this

182
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:55,060
him into the mattress who are willing to
do that's well

183
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:00,210
his well the first party hats well

184
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:03,490
you know deal he's a product rights

185
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:07,000
his was initially exchange

186
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,660
we're paying money for a particular
products

187
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,170
and this point can be vulnerable you

188
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:21,300
we can say for example you know it's if
be fun to launder ability

189
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:26,400
yentl and its can demand a discount like
we first perform in order its

190
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:31,430
he show that's the right your existing
vulnerabilities

191
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:36,070
we calculate how much money will cost us
to reach his dreams to remove the

192
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,060
smaller bills him

193
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,880
when we come to me demand a manager
intelligent

194
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,100
you know was it will take us three men
months

195
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,140
ac3 hundred thousand rubles

196
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,820
he and the toes you know what

197
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,110
we have a five million dollar
transactions

198
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,910
no your was one

199
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,180
get thousands I'm sorry attend him

200
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,970
voices key 300,000 rules will not impact

201
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:09,510
and too many things we do you need to
mention the scene sign

202
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:14,740
weaving came up with a formula which we
hope you will not be able to read it

203
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:19,740
good we would marianna low-intensity

204
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:25,460
its really we use it once which sold
thank you but no thank you

205
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:30,410
and that was the end of story him I see
people are taking photos

206
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,660
its on way too long using it

207
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:40,890
I'll give you the presentation to worry
well

208
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:44,290
he well our index

209
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:49,070
I couldn't here was you kitchens is a
risk assessment

210
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,390
rosy his longer abilities

211
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:57,120
up knowledge so you know Sykes time the
rankings in the holes

212
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,630
change a risk exposure you well if for
example your service processes personal

213
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,650
data

214
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:07,650
he stays account leaks it's not just a
matter

215
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:11,110
phone lines YUM but it's also is

216
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,810
better offer red potential reputational
damage

217
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,769
steak and which itself is formulas which

218
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:22,080
not showing here people you

219
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,250
so even Chile told business people you
know what

220
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:30,130
you can buy this application and if it's
a really highly vulnerable it will

221
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,950
the company's risk exposure from other
services we hear

222
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:38,140
on data can be stolen and internal date
again miss nolan we're talking up

223
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,550
millions and millions of dollars at
stake here

224
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:46,750
in the business response was who was the
chance this will happen will tell you

225
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:46,959
know

226
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,700
every school kids can't do that no you

227
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,570
yes and they tell us said

228
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:58,550
you know what's we are signing this deal
his

229
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,230
proof that the high-level your call is
very important to us

230
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:05,510
thank you good so

231
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:11,750
we came up with it so does EU him

232
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,839
it was you we decided to

233
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,050
styles from the very beginning obviously
the information security but doesn't

234
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,470
really care much about discounts

235
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,870
what we care belts is and

236
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:30,649
getting Nolan EU vulnerable Coles we
care about

237
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:35,339
maintaining the same level of protection
for the other services at the end

238
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:38,589
and want to make sure that the new team
with it

239
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:43,370
buttons the you he's able to play by the
rules

240
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:48,329
so he sexually we have objects that
lott's financial at all

241
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:51,800
yet said this is her

242
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,149
we came out it was several process which
you see here

243
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:59,500
good if biotechnology

244
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,770
you and his dusan want would be

245
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:06,520
sometimes can buy it tech database

246
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,200
you

247
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,950
he sometimes a biotechnology and iran is
also

248
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:17,240
somebody else's us law well

249
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:24,230
issue he he put it differently sometimes
you know waco or something that will

250
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:24,840
Lake

251
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,310
aunt for the grace period of transition

252
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:31,500
every way using this seller's

253
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,760
machinery and the seller's coat we're
redesigning the Colt

254
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,850
eventually we'll move everything in
tortillas

255
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,650
by this time who'll have resulted in
close

256
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:47,950
you well

257
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:51,160
of

258
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,950
and the information security problems
certainly has no issue with that

259
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:58,510
position only technologists he

260
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:01,670
only size shirts no guts

261
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:05,140
we will appreciate eighteen years tell
us

262
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:09,540
ahead of time not this time he going to
do so that we can take it was thinking

263
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,180
though the best acknowledges

264
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:17,310
the best architectures as far as I S is
concerned

265
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:21,010
sheep you if we're buying coats

266
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:24,170
this be trickier this thing on

267
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:27,880
it saying we should buy

268
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,750
cult relegate into infrastructure

269
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,350
and we keep developing its which is
exactly what it is without a little too

270
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:35,860
are you

271
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:40,210
know the one case by Charles link

272
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:44,010
we can actually buy cold redesigned

273
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:48,330
something will factor business processes
fully understand

274
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,410
that eventually this colt will be phased
out

275
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:58,300
you who did

276
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:02,810
who that

277
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,240
getting him white out books

278
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,460
cheering and I'm and Atos near
impossibility muskie's we're dealing

279
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,550
with the black box

280
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:14,430
or a great books which means that we
never know

281
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:17,580
so many critical vulnerabilities can be
discovered he

282
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,190
overall it will show something he

283
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:25,000
you but not everything is a lil

284
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,750
you will need to extrapolate the state
said

285
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:33,290
for example will understand though if in
a particular piece of chocolate with Ben

286
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:33,920
Elias

287
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,640
lots of our abilities wish him all the
girls will be very buggy

288
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,790
you possible

289
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:45,020
you will turn to leave we see

290
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:48,540
the underlying technologies pretty
secure in the way it is

291
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:54,160
we he

292
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,910
will be more relaxed in any case the we
will demand

293
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:01,070
that all vulnerabilities up biatch the
all

294
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:04,860
the services are low center
infrastructure which is

295
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:08,680
don't have an impact on the value of the
deal we can easily have an impact on the

296
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,470
deadlines

297
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:15,120
history essentially

298
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,220
tell everybody the no may need two
fastest

299
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,300
is you

300
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,399
the Holy See the

301
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,840
underlying technology he is very well

302
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,920
his system will all go into the
century-long

303
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:37,340
go into the DMZ you so that we can study
it in detail

304
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:41,370
who him

305
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,770
and then I'll we can either

306
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:48,900
link it to other services always say you
know what there is in dole

307
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,080
way

308
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,120
we can't link this system to existing
stores you

309
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,250
on chest that he has to be redesigned

310
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,790
we way requiring in Seymour

311
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:05,200
them my said

312
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,320
was pretty easy because we include them
in the

313
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:13,410
awareness raising routine which a talked
about in the previous PhD

314
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:16,690
E well watch

315
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:20,890
gene we have by the way and mandate to
require

316
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:24,410
this induction if you like training

317
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:29,970
Korean tation trainee not yesterday
conducted offline

318
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:34,780
you know that it earned it in first you

319
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:38,410
so talk about access controls lows here

320
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:41,470
then our truck is will

321
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:45,330
tell holding you hires holes different
technologies

322
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:48,420
Mosby use secure meant

323
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:52,870
we usually talk to them nobel Boehner
bill is senator often

324
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:57,470
overlooked by developers or testers up

325
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:01,710
so we'll see in two great teams 0 it can
happen

326
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,760
be sold in team has moved into our
office

327
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:09,220
or a us happens buddy in both cases

328
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,290
me include them in our life this quickly
as we can

329
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:15,530
than the replicates he

330
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:18,870
all him

331
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:22,990
both israeli cations will differ
depending on the kind of deal was struck

332
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,440
me

333
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,880
after dole's are you for example spent
some time working there

334
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,290
old office should

335
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:35,280
and they will probably integrated in our
infrastructure at the beginning or

336
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:41,240
mean yet I remember that we bought it
seems in saint petersburg some time

337
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,080
until

338
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,150
and sometime they worked by VPN

339
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:49,130
and we didn't me this service we needed
that

340
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:52,410
people so they will connect our system
by

341
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:56,700
the PN that will help us to build
shortens good

342
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,560
team we recently waters months

343
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,720
trains over it or understand no worky of
our equipment

344
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,190
but its it's a small team of

345
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:11,350
after those very easily pushed me its
did

346
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,640
and great once his pic is them

347
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:23,610
while him

348
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:27,350
we're looking at different ways of doing
that because that we are trying to make

349
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,490
sure that we

350
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:31,530
to here those no old rubles

351
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:35,700
soldiers home mention to rate and on old
has been much straight away but

352
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,730
sometimes

353
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:41,080
it's simply not possible young

354
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,900
which means we have a link to its we
have a Sony

355
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:49,350
that its like power to here

356
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,980
people when you room

357
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,210
while now we have a dedicated

358
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:00,140
the Lions you that

359
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:04,630
in nablas adults particular systems in
China James E

360
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:07,660
I'll for copper nails

361
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:11,290
said

362
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:14,960
we have standardized most operations the
company

363
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,450
this relegation peacefully unique I
can't remember a single

364
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:27,020
allocation would go asp bring

365
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,570
obviously things don't work this designs

366
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:33,820
transactions are always strolls with
issues

367
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:38,770
you know there are others deals at a
sign at the very top level and

368
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:43,810
really luncheons say know we will get
for your own orders

369
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:47,050
will make our own recommendations of

370
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:51,770
however the ninety-nine percent on the
heels

371
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:57,890
well the who will now go according to
these bruises

372
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:02,680
people he estado everybody in the nose

373
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,180
if and this is buying a company they
need to resort to the information

374
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,050
security department

375
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:12,550
and we are going to provide them with a
list of criteria they need to check for

376
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:16,740
didn't pretty well-known process for all
managers

377
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,990
it is designed to be simple button is
great

378
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:26,100
units me special you believe it's a
fully functional process were several

379
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:26,720
reasons

380
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,820
first we

381
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,900
don't Lok into

382
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:38,180
the issues in the business seems to note
that be only minor on business which is

383
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,700
immigration Zune

384
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,530
we don't teach business how to do
business you

385
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:47,480
which makes our life so much easier

386
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:55,250
Julia said

387
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:58,720
you

388
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,800
and you

389
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:07,400
what makes it so much easier for the
business SEO point

390
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,470
them I personally believe all

391
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:13,600
that a cumbersome process know works

392
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,320
unless he heavily invested in it that's
why we've designed the grossest

393
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:21,840
be as convenient as possible so is
convenient

394
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,850
dealer for the M&A manager and most
convenient for us as well

395
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:30,970
hits by the way a pretty automated Pro
System

396
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:34,830
I'm you he

397
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:38,860
dealer manager who who will

398
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:43,270
fill out all week old a blunt

399
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:47,240
spreadsheets whatever 1000 sales the

400
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,760
an ace they mention how we can test the
waters where there were only black box

401
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,060
or

402
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:57,090
white box testing than generated ticket
scented

403
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:00,950
when the special security department so
we tested this will work

404
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:05,460
and then we would use our own decision
if you like

405
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:10,310
well first so we tell the turkeys on the
seller's site will they think about

406
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,240
mister this

407
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,910
we tell our own take his

408
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:20,980
these are all time recommendations don't
wait on how we can help them begin or

409
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,370
help

410
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:24,560
yes and for the managers the army

411
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,950
we say that for example this is their
virani

412
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:32,320
service and you will have to wait months
cultural passion up

413
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,679
this will looks like minutes know it's
obviously very long you only see it

414
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:37,800
pushin

415
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,360
the and I will update its

416
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,630
will follow up with me realize that
something is missing

417
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:47,870
we can easily go back to it and more
information

418
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:52,340
thing it now takes three or four screens
total

419
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:56,410
also collect all the information
required

420
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:59,560
of

421
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,150

422
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:08,770
in %um and a is so she it it came to me
and asked to explain how the process

423
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:09,350
works

424
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:14,100
yet I gave him the link and told him if
he needs any information

425
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,520
any other information you know it's
called me he never calls link you know I

426
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,470
know there was too much information well

427
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:25,929
up well the

428
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:29,030

our assets an hour service all the same
time making sure the

do we have to make we don't

452
00:29:02,769 --> 00:29:16,180
but we need one

453
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:19,430
hood

454
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:22,850
we usually buy web services

455
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:27,010
as you like would you like to give a
particular example

456
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:30,500
vulnerability for me he said

457
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,790
take an aspirin cool

458
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:36,930

why don't you know hunts the heiress we
sometimes

460
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,520
combines theory unusual vulnerabilities

461
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,780
speak eat dawn of

462
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:52,330
find out during the first sold it
because he usually web services

463
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:56,090
for old with errors and vulnerabilities

464
00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:00,330
you know you don't have to dig deep in
all say is because they are bad

465
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:07,640
just because he's startups they have
other concerns ski wax

466
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,280
excess you know the game you

467
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:17,840

we

472
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:46,390
hood

473
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:51,270
now warm first use in areas I told you
about it was scrapped

474
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:55,600
it's snowing no longer you calculates
risk

475
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:01,890
probabilities the him

476
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:05,309
yes spawner abilities

477
00:31:05,309 --> 00:31:09,740
usually look into things that's
criticality simplicity

478
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:13,559
owner rules on here so it's

479
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:16,710
difference simple that is ColdGear

480
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:20,390
you know a script kiddie or
cat-and-mouse

know is here we will happen

482
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:27,169
know he have to go through several
sequences

483
00:31:27,169 --> 00:31:31,049

business

511
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,700
an excuse believes is don't you know it
took us years to develop

512
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,059
wild-card the

513
00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:37,169
so it's a great situation for us now you
know

514
00:33:37,169 --> 00:33:40,970

them hitting

516
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:48,690
so we came to the seven-day manager to
eat them let's develop

517
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:52,929
an agreement to Cape

518
00:33:52,929 --> 00:33:56,470
world

519
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:00,149

521
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,970
hoped

522
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:16,030
he's in a calling that is about to be
acquired

523
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:27,610
has protection each goes on to say no

524
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:31,450
in order to me its secure coal products

525
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:35,780
to change it completely from scratch
what

526
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:39,730
will use say and managers some

527
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:47,159
experience no

528
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:50,710
where some acquisitions which we have to
reduce who

529
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:54,340
that turn out to be pretty expensive I'm

530
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:58,120
but they didn't kill the deals really i
think is we only place

531
