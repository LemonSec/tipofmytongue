1
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:04,640
I was and what

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,880
here

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,960
that they're goin' all to listen to me
so luckily

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,460
they have diesel my name is

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,530
quote watch it over and over

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:20,700
we do application so a disclaimer
everything I'm showing you today

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,920
is a proof of concept it's not a
production version

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,580
it's our research done over the last few
months that we decided to share

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:35,920
we have not

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,250
even decided it was going to be within
the application inspector functionality

11
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:40,460
a

12
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,680
so for the next hour which will be
talking

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,850
about generating patches for

14
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,500
vulnerable source called as I talk to
you

15
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,680
no I'm not so much speaking on behalf of
myself but

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,019
am of the team so there are many people
behind my presentation

17
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:04,610
and I believe we should start to by

18
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,979
explaining how we got Badia automatic

19
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:14,810
pictures application expect a is a tool
that we started developing three years

20
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,450
ago for our in-house purposes so first
developers

21
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,700
worked in them

22
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,780
a protection security a

23
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,290
for analysis and the first issue we
faced was

24
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:33,200
the false positives from

25
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,910
other scanners one you have 50 results
from a scanner

26
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:42,110
you can the handles them manually but
with 500

27
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,580
you know you feel helpless

28
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,680
so we decided to develop and

29
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,030
analyzer so sore scored

30
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,700
and binary code so doc falling

31
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,470
so was not so much

32
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,520
to test but to

33
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,110
develop

34
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,720
so no secret

35
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,500
we use abstract interpretation this
source code

36
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,560
and Joe PHP interpretation binary

37
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,910
so we

38
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,950
tried squeeze the most with

39
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,670
combining static and dynamic analysis

40
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,770
and simple execution

41
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,090
so the main goal

42
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,130
was to verify the checkers upon their
abilities

43
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,310
so we needed to confirm or if you

44
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,160
the vulnerabilities so to confirm

45
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,210
or refute was easy to build the attack
vector

46
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,940
once it's there we can try and see that
vulnerability

47
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,420
exists and if not then

48
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,440
no so later when we realize that this
tool

49
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,070
could be of use to other people so

50
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:05,220
we went to the big red button concept it
means that any person

51
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,830
even a muggle you know once here pushes
read but then he can skim the

52
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,640
application and then check the results

53
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,180
and see if that indeed there they they
exit the exploiter

54
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,350
is India's so considering the latest
trends

55
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,540
and then discussing our products like

56
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,220
I could not there refrain from
commenting that this is completely our

57
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,230
own development

58
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,810
it doesn't to it's not based on any open
source project to

59
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:38,040
because the open source projects that
would provide

60
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,360
for those three languages this hybrid of
static and dynamic does not exist

61
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,480
if you want you can go out am

62
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,260
check an

63
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,250
on the first stage of AI development we
do

64
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:59,340
we learned to integrate their with our
PT Application Firewall

65
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,790
so we integrated in the following way:
we found the vulnerability will build

66
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:05,540
the exploit

67
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:10,580
who is a number of parameters speaking
about their web application

68
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,610
me up where you exploit the

69
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,530
the the

70
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,519
vulnerabilities so nothing stops us from
building

71
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:23,030
information for PT Application Firewall
so that the

72
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,510
it would recognize this entry point and
that once

73
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:30,540
as a as an attack with the parameters

74
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,200
so the application firewall will
immediately

75
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,599
returned this query within error so

76
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,210
it works great especially in the
organizations where you need

77
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:46,240
that that that that the process of
changing the source code is a long and

78
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,260
painful

79
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:51,470
so if you find a vulnerability you
closer to move and use them to

80
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,290
developers had to fix it

81
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:57,210
but the downside there are only there's
only

82
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,260
irreparable downside you need the
Application Firewall

83
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,229
its easy to fix you just get the
application firewall

84
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:08,570
I'm the second downside

85
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:12,150
that the Application Firewall cannot

86
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:16,410
understand the situation cannot fix this
in her from the M when the

87
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:20,789
entry point to the exit point we use a
dangerous parameter

88
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:24,039
for instance a comma that gets into this
Camille

89
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:29,310
it's used in the application logic and
if application logic blocks it it means

90
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:29,850
that

91
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:33,320
it somehow mmm

92
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,100
negatively impacts to the whole code

93
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,070
Symantec's because the Application
Firewall cannot get inside the code

94
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,100
and only to call

95
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,370
the dangerous function but though he
will block everything

96
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:51,360
on the way so

97
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,830
once we want to fix it and start to
generate have pagers patches for

98
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,000
vulnerable code

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,410
so that we could apply them to the
original code and get the protected

100
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:08,320
application version sold

101
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,520
in order to generate fetches first you
need to understand what is a

102
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,950
vulnerability and what is fixing it

103
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:19,330
to cage vulnerability you need to know
three things:

104
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,880
so first you need to know how it
shouldn't be

105
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,810
so the formal prerequisite the math

106
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,130
you know prerequisites of the

107
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:34,220
bug in the cold so that we could say

108
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:39,240
yes this code has vulnerability then we
should understand how

109
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,670
it is really because it's not always
that you can take a cold

110
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:47,140
and that analyze and say yes we have
science here or no

111
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,820
we don't have signs here so we have to

112
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,610
know it and once we can we

113
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:59,590
should build the attack vector and
confirm their vulnerabilities so take

114
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,419
the formal

115
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:04,730
are science of the injection so

116
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,840
we used more or less human

117
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,090
language here brothers and formulas

118
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,500
so we have the potentially vulnerable
operation

119
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,090
as interpretation over text on their
formal

120
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,730
in a formal language for instance SQL
inquiry

121
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:26,140
web server or whatever

122
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,990
files operations if expenses query

123
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,979
and on and these text

124
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:37,120
is a result of transformation

125
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,580
or and argument the entry point that
came

126
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,080
from the outside in case of well web
applications

127
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,110
HTP query and transforming function

128
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,340
is a number of all functions their

129
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,270
for our argument transforms on the way

130
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,750
and then this sign sounds

131
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,870
as you know at least to

132
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,919
one element with changes

133
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,520
the structure of sin taxes sis indexing
tree

134
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,330
of value of text Ichi

135
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,249
to up to peel so even

136
00:08:16,249 --> 00:08:19,889
we take away a coma and and Paul comes

137
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:23,139
we get the injection the it gets into
the

138
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:26,519
this and it follows it falls within the

139
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:30,979
sign so you can actually right equations

140
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:34,300
and formally use them that's what we're
going to do next

141
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,329
so no you cannot

142
00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:40,949
formalize all the vulnerabilities as a
rules

143
00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:44,850
self-serve because sometimes we don't
know how it should be or it shouldn't be

144
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,230
and a all types of injections

145
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:53,920
beyond a SQL and author so that I wasted
two

146
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,399
can be formalized buffer overflow

147
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:00,680
at least a for detecting

148
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,620
is quite easy formalize a bull them

149
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,689
and a other things

150
00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:13,779
on the slide so you can hardly formalize

151
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:17,050
as I told you because

152
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:20,170
it's unclear what is ever on their
ability what's wrong

153
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:24,250
in the code what makes it well the room
its either we know it but we cannot

154
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:24,819
check

155
00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:28,069
for instance access

156
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:31,559
errors is a is an example you we have

157
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:37,730
an application that

158
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,370
controls access 3 it means

159
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,740
that we can analyze echoed and find

160
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,430
signs of our access distribution

161
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,780
for different users so we can

162
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:56,030
find out as it is but we don't know from
the point of view

163
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:59,740
developer how it should have been
looking I mean

164
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,810
the access policy so

165
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,010
which

166
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:09,450
data is accessible to which user because

167
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:14,220
you cannot judge by the code only the
developers who developed the code no

168
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,000
so maximum what we can do here is to
look

169
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,180
day access right send them look

170
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:26,730
if you know cease

171
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,339
access distribution is sir applicable

172
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:33,790
everywhere this is not just a
vulnerability this is probably

173
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:38,160
nur just a slightly wrong development

174
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,180
and we need to know the formal access
policy

175
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,339
so for the users and assigns how

176
00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:48,360
you differentiate the user's

177
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,509
on their way so approximately the same
picture with this session manager

178
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:55,579
she

179
00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:59,569
are ever concurrency and a

180
00:10:59,569 --> 00:11:03,480
as a rule you cannot reverse

181
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,050
the code so

182
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:10,779
through the court we can hardly
understand the banking corporation be

183
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:14,160
and a moreover the rice

184
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,589
theory theorem tells us

185
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:20,920
that we cannot resolve the arbitrary

186
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:28,699
logic so probably the weekends to
formalize a some

187
00:11:28,699 --> 00:11:33,920
of the write him list but the actual is
the chart is quite accurate

188
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,290
probably CSRF can be formalized

189
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:41,449
for most cases what do we have

190
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:45,620
when we won to generate

191
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,839
which is how do we detect
vulnerabilities we have

192
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:52,279
symbolic execution context graph them

193
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:58,480
the only a result of the application
expect their after analyzing the codes

194
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,130
at them

195
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:03,230
we want disclaimer again I will only
describe the graph and

196
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:07,670
the way we work with it how we get it
well

197
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:10,850
I need two hours to explain and we only

198
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:16,180
we have two hours presentation lower CBS
Corp we hear

199
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,399
we can't tell you how we made make it

200
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:23,310
but now I'll tell you what's in and

201
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:29,500
to how it can help us build bridges this
is a wonder grab versus

202
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,620
a normal flow where some

203
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,029
additional info with some additional
information so-called

204
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:41,480
context of symbol execution campaigns of
two parts:

205
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,440
the condition offer it each evening so

206
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:52,210
so under what conditions would get to
this point

207
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:56,470
and many

208
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,990
values of all the variables and
conditions of the

209
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,240
ownership so that are achievable for
this point

210
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,670
it's very difficult honest hun what what
it means

211
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:12,850
there is a simple code and their I can

212
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:18,529
I can just show you as an example so you
write down the Parham one

213
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:26,450
HTTP query then you check the parameters
eg request whatever you can read it if

214
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,570
p.m.

215
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,700
after that we check

216
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,950
con to parameter if yes

217
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:38,120
we assign and rewrite as

218
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,210
harm to which we get from HTTP

219
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:45,850
and then if not then we rewrite

220
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,040
with this safe well

221
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:57,870
and then farm goes as and attribute

222
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,110
so in the very beginning in the upper
point here

223
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:05,590
we have absolutely symbol absolutely
empty simple

224
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:10,240
contact epsilon means that any condition
would do

225
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,190
an absolutely empty variable

226
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:18,150
after the first execution as a context
yes

227
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:21,350
one value dash means

228
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:24,630
its symbolic contains

229
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:31,930
the them

230
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,300
will they

231
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:41,700
next change

232
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,160
and after that we go to the next point

233
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,700
and then context changes

234
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,720
because we only get here

235
00:14:52,720 --> 00:15:00,060
you something happens so we have this
same number of

236
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:05,280
values because there was no rewrite and
we're getting into this point only

237
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,310
if this return does not execute and

238
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:13,700
and

239
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,460
so farm the negative condition

240
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,660
is the only value

241
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,980
so we show come here with

242
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:30,820
farm only if we don't go to return and
the same way

243
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:35,510
we change the context

244
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:39,080
local there are two conditions we have
not we don't

245
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,160
we cannot get to return we must not get
to return but we must get here

246
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,710
and then negation the first

247
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:51,280
condition to get here so in this point
we get a very interesting picture

248
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,880
base point is achievable on the if they
return does not execute

249
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:00,370
here farm we have two

250
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:04,610
possible values these under that
condition

251
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:08,510
or that race

252
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,830
is context

253
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,310
so it's clear that for real applications

254
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:18,920
it's on real to keep all this graph as
soon as we have

255
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,950
cycles and Matt mess and eraser

256
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:27,660
been no slight sufficient to show so
they will work with this graph the build

257
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,000
it with optimize it

258
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,350
is our No that

259
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:35,350
you will never know Z conference

260
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:40,170
in September but still from the mask one
to you

261
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:45,210
at any moment this graph is going to be
a

262
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:49,040
we can build any part of this crap
within

263
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,550
acceptable time and then somehow work
with so

264
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,930
after we

265
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:01,660
executed bill the graph weekend the
following weekend

266
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:06,350
a lecture dangers operations like this
response

267
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:09,520
and she response

268
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,360
to the Webster weekend

269
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,410
book this when these dangerous operation
will be

270
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:20,510
done so innings

271
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:30,140
and we can take Mar them look at the
moment

272
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:34,630
execution and write it as a formula
which looks as follows:

273
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:38,570
now sold

274
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:43,110
if see condition as mine

275
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:47,299
so we should response right with the
following values: we

276
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:52,330
use see a multitude of value so that we
get from this simple questions

277
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:55,750
sewn here we can take out

278
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,799
they said come to brunch because it's
not

279
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,179
managed externally and its

280
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:05,610
safe so the formula

281
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,260
will become shorter or

282
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:14,419
weekend sanded duck to get the

283
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:17,460
conditions on their ability once we

284
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:22,120
once it's not true

285
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,380
and come to is true would

286
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,880
here is another question

287
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:37,140
that we still lack we so

288
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,549
on to get this injection a so what

289
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:44,059
should be value so that we get beyond

290
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:47,649
mental action so here we

291
00:18:47,649 --> 00:18:52,669
determine the type of injection which is
quite trivial

292
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:55,890
week take see

293
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,860
entry point where the same gets that

294
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,049
can bring injection and

295
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:06,250
them we start scanning

296
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,570
0 available

297
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:13,299
strain that goes to the dangerous
functions grim

298
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:17,720
my exception all possible types of
tokens that could

299
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,770
to here

300
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:24,730
cell no I will not show you any

301
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:30,829
example so at the first iteration we

302
00:19:30,829 --> 00:19:35,959
shows a think almost a week geyser have

303
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:40,709
attributes or as a text or HTML them

304
00:19:40,709 --> 00:19:45,940
here

305
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:50,190
strong

306
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,220
so we can't to

307
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:58,129
this she

308
00:19:58,129 --> 00:20:02,889
tak and see that indeed do we shall be
wasn't that tired and the only possible

309
00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:03,820
talk on here

310
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,869
is a their attributes value

311
00:20:06,869 --> 00:20:11,820
as we know

312
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:16,789
injection want time win known we have
let them the base and all the

313
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:21,440
vectors for these pointed

314
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,499
we I'll and two conditions

315
00:20:24,499 --> 00:20:28,090
does it Boehner ability because we have
to factors he

316
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:32,840
this on this and a for

317
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,019
each time we have several dozen satchel

318
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:41,749
and we give it to the SMT solver

319
00:20:41,749 --> 00:20:49,920
as a normal on equation

320
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,220
we get the value

321
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:57,750
for those parameters and

322
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,230
so it can have

323
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:04,270
any value except room and the

324
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:08,230
the river situation here only true there
is no conflict

325
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:11,870
and to mmm

326
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:15,170
this equation can be solved

327
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:18,250
cell the solo will select the first one

328
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,710
Eve we had the filter

329
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:25,150
this vector

330
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,530
wouldn't do salwar would arrange it and
select

331
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:32,950
the specter was

332
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:38,610
and after the use of solar would get the
context

333
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:44,110
attack vector

334
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,030
value of entry point

335
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:52,730
that on

336
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:56,380
that that will give us an attack sick
last text to

337
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,059
vector is not HTTP query but there was a
restriction

338
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:07,720
for the symbol context

339
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,530
the we did we seize it

340
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:13,490
injection time for the no they attribute
and

341
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:17,250
vector variable im

342
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,770
is the one that eaves ask an injection

343
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:25,549
and we need to

344
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:29,850
get but it to get the value to get into
the dangerous operation

345
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:33,480
so for the context to rebuild HTTP

346
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,580
we know that the entry point

347
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,679
and request

348
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:44,290
arms shitty wary

349
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:47,929
as aunt point is fear

350
00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:51,470
which is ok issue to be queried

351
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,110
exploit

352
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:59,390
excellent want to lack and

353
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:02,600
if actually is

354
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:07,510
we have everything we need to have all
the makings and all amenities just

355
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:11,669
tinkered work perhaps what is the right
but is there a catch

356
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:15,559
so let's give us initially give
ourselves a good to finish

357
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:19,900
so the criterion that perhaps for a
patch some minimum changes

358
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:24,419
right some very important which is and

359
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:25,670
so the

360
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,180
the smaller the better name minimum

361
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:34,210
invasive technique yeah and and a patch
that breaks the Colt

362
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:39,270
no one instead that kind of page so then
patch certain should fix the problem

363
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:42,340
100 percent batch covers ninety-nine
percent

364
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:45,660
on offense this is better not to have
such match

365
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:49,090
and patch should not generate any
additional

366
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:53,120
issues how do we get

367
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,220
onto a January to patch so so the

368
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:01,820
attack vector can be a likened to the
generation of age

369
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:05,390
so we have to know

370
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:08,430
down so many just to see the sign

371
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:12,000
science and see what do we work to

372
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,070
part kind of from my bad guy so we are
getting

373
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:19,290
games and since those science

374
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:23,610
necessary so analyze them and the summer

375
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:27,900
here we don't have all the signs and
show the court may not be

376
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:33,070
recognizable and then that differs
definition bundy

377
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:37,400
the signs her so I am going so they had
the red line

378
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,580
goes under something that we

379
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,910
her can that is doable especially

380
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,800
toward injections

381
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,960
so that many menu values of the entry
points

382
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,810
story is so danca points a myth
immediately can 6

383
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:56,830
called the are the dangers values stop
them

384
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,940
danger point it is the same thing that
to that

385
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,880
my world sand then that we can now

386
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,320
her do it in the in a different fashion

387
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,450
so that the it will not be doable.

388
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:15,490
as I can not changing structure on the
scene packs

389
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:19,320
tree and home any value hand that can

390
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,160
reach the value of Peel and thus I just
can't

391
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,870
hook up with a into the live stream so
to say

392
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:31,229
sought to to wait to to preclude don't

393
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:33,820
than they're usually a sign the majority
of

394
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,299
on their bill to succumb used 3 three
methods to fight

395
00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:41,450
to combat dumb SF s at typing

396
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:44,489
a validation and sanitation

397
00:25:44,489 --> 00:25:48,509
so to Ashland bringing at bringing the

398
00:25:48,509 --> 00:25:52,309
dangerous value to something that and

399
00:25:52,309 --> 00:25:55,379
that tests are getting getting a line
from

400
00:25:55,379 --> 00:26:00,710
an object this validation is an entry
entry for emitter just to limit it to

401
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:04,469
hand to bring in to put it into the
brackets are certain

402
00:26:04,469 --> 00:26:08,039
value and sanitation is as

403
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:11,089
is taking the lead dangers parameter and

404
00:26:11,089 --> 00:26:14,759
hereunder it not dangers you want

405
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:18,009
what a difference a day a at the

406
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:21,129
attack vector from patch what the
differences for

407
00:26:21,129 --> 00:26:25,989
the attack a victory we need to find a
new one way how to exploit

408
00:26:25,989 --> 00:26:29,580
on their ability them because this is
the pro

409
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:33,359
there when there is an owner check and
find one away

410
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,739
him and a time how the injection

411
00:26:36,739 --> 00:26:40,849
occurs so we can just talk show it show
the user and

412
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:45,849
say removed so with patch so we need to
find all pathways

413
00:26:45,849 --> 00:26:48,930
from venture point to appeal

414
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:52,720
and and give the entire set of sense
different

415
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,170
values of her vector variables

416
00:26:56,170 --> 00:27:00,140
missus this is very important

417
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,890
and because

418
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:07,420
that when they just a senate time
somehow

419
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:10,880
took to clean it to clean it up
validated because many

420
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,100
to Hampden tire center different a

421
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:18,600
vector variables than son then

422
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,210
and what we use to to cut the
generational director

423
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:27,490
in I once there is a for success we just
stopped at the Midland

424
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:31,560
and so the first variable became idea
the basic variables

425
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,860
and have been regenerated a possible
pathways in all

426
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:43,230
values Paso this pizza they went down
down damn

427
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:47,450
sorry for there is a bigger problem with
them

428
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:50,610
a service where when you when you know
the injections

429
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:54,760
her point it it its EU restrictions

430
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,270
does not give you 100 percent a result

431
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:01,490
so because then so have only 23 tokars

432
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:05,600
for for an entire a set of variables and
you cannot

433
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,950
select the right one one just to clean
it up so when they just to see

434
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:13,770
count what will be the underpinning
grammar

435
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:18,880
that will help us to do the cleanup and

436
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,550
and then for many languages like HTML in
other languages

437
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:27,190
should not not tonya identify the type
of talk about this semantics

438
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:30,830
because and because the attributes
action attributes

439
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:34,980
are called it in one way and other
things are called it in different ways

440
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,950
and so that's why it has nothing to do
with entry point or

441
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:45,880
the injection point him and the mostaert
formidable problema

442
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:50,250
what's the most important one is that we
should not to assert damage

443
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:53,820
the application because we don't care

444
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:59,050
I was going to happen so after injection
occurs because you definitely kitchen

445
00:28:59,050 --> 00:28:59,590
falls

446
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:04,470
collapses works we all could not do that
work on the forts just have deprecation

447
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,010
die

448
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:08,710
and so this flash so for example the
overloaded

449
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:13,740
overloaded offers Center someone just to
make sure that the application is up and

450
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,240
running

451
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,220
and does because if for crashes

452
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:22,350
it's too late tests have siap skip here
we have a patch

453
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:28,590
so we cannot sone to guarantee that the
fuse attached to the application will

454
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:31,740
be operating that in the previous case I
can

455
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:36,360
pick in the for just a hefty application
crash for a while and

456
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,400
so let me just do I identified the the
point two injections

457
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,590
very important and very accurate
accurate

458
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:46,990
identification calculation injection
point

459
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:51,800
so we used a different counting so we
would

460
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,510
put this her

461
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:58,160
assets on the symbol was put into place
home or

462
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,900
on their ability a instead of paying

463
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:06,640
source so that unique symbol then with
daycare modified

464
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,840
parser modified I'll

465
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,940
Island language that house for the
appearance of special symbols

466
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,970
I in a random still going

467
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:21,309
as the second the second step

468
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:24,850
so whether just break it into number of
tokens something

469
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:28,170
lacks account definition process

470
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:32,020
so this this this symbol can be part of

471
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:36,220
any her apart tolkan which the grammar
and language allows

472
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:41,990
Orinda for and you can consider it is a
scandal while

473
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:45,820
car card from the viewpoint of do a
parser see

474
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:50,290
she isn't and then the so once forces
done its work

475
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:53,309
got a syntax tree syntax tree

476
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:56,530
some after the process has

477
00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:00,510
done it's John and then not just went to
see so

478
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:04,000
where this unique symbol got into

479
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,130
with two which into which note something

480
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:11,070
so then depending on at work branch of
the tree

481
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:14,070
so this unique symbol got to at

482
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:17,190
way we can whole race

483
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:21,820
realized the point of injection 2.0
injections

484
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:27,600
tagname opening bracket tribute addition
nation closing bracket engine

485
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,700
name Simon signed and done nationally up

486
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,840
so each weekend identifies this unique
sound of

487
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,650
this is where our symbol got to and
Anderson now we know

488
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:45,150
point injection would we have the

489
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:48,290
the value of the attribute sound

490
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:51,350
quoted tribute semantic row

491
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:54,560
enters the grammar this

492
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,720
determined ride or

493
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,880
he worked at this second he's

494
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,560
more challenging use keeping the
semantics

495
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,850
hot to cold and damaged

496
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:13,080
more difficult time so we have developed
circles

497
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,110
first txt the the Mariners

498
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:21,450
have several several levels some I can
talk

499
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:25,480
here for you too can

500
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,820
typified you can can 95 tissue at them

501
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:33,710
if you cannot type my it was sanitized
can sometimes validated

502
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:39,400
and then when a judge to consider all
the terms of payment of PVL

503
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,950
and its values

504
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:45,470
and its arguments during type defying

505
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:50,029
should showing to show you some examples

506
00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:54,440
after defying not change from the here
source called

507
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:59,980
and a so we have so the entry are the
dangers

508
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:03,019
value occurs here and there are no
doubting

509
00:33:03,019 --> 00:33:07,059
change it gets here and then we use
their

510
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:10,759
as described in their way identified
this

511
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:14,960
the rooms this is the URL semantic
quoted

512
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,620
at revealed semantic you're out value
and

513
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:23,639
that means that petrifying is possible
which would

514
00:33:23,639 --> 00:33:28,610
sought and patch to patch looks like
this

515
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:34,820
with type if I

516
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:38,690
so deeper ammeter and then get the URL

517
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:43,200
and him

518
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,170
the library's and then something that
when we signed

519
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:51,760
danger the harmful value we will put
this subject together again

520
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,280
and using see version that will not

521
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,710
fill out to come out bragged talk said

522
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:02,350
the the rest is unchanged stays as was

523
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:05,890
and become a safe sup

524
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:10,240
didn't have the standard a shitty amount
turns into this function

525
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,409
function than if we put it into
sanitizing down would have spoiled

526
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:18,580
semantics and stacked values

527
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:22,600
different after the sanitizing function

528
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,799
was done and so this we do it

529
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,810
pinpoint so where the problem is that's
where

530
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:32,119
sanitizing some San as

531
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:35,230
example jazz the injection point has
changed

532
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:38,750
that was changed sanitizing

533
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:41,859
same same harmful spot

534
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:45,359
for for so here's injection

535
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,570

parameters not come back with something
changes

600
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:23,369
us a good example so everything straight
forward

601
00:39:23,369 --> 00:39:26,499
checked and the HTP parameters queries 0

602
00:39:26,499 --> 00:39:31,829
snot people does pickle zeros down this
parameter is not transformed into

00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:32,349
anything

604
00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:36,469
and then it gets if quick accord

605
00:39:36,469 --> 00:39:39,759
Quinn signs and then took goes into and
other

606

how a mentor management and

on their ability to stick %um

612
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:19,910
now and can launch this the console
version loaded

613
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:23,230
or analyzer knock works

614
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:34,680
is called protocol artworks and use

615
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,710
would build a context attack vector

616
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:42,010
and terrible this HDPE attack vectors

617
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:45,130
group during winter and we got patch

618
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:48,340
and line to into someone's

619
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:53,260
to replace its line turned to stone
columns

620
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:58,010
sounds when to remove this line and
replace it with another one

621
00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:05,330
so they're seated turns into encoding
because the injection point

622
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:14,990
and next Sunday apply patch this

623
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,170
and after that

624
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:21,539
supplies good

625
00:41:21,539 --> 00:41:26,329
and now i cant ensure that the initial
call changed including

626
00:41:26,329 --> 00:41:31,030
wasn't outside and now

627
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:34,660
can can once again check on their
ability is gone

628
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:40,530
good

629
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:57,330
turnout works fine

630
00:41:57,330 --> 00:42:18,580
here this is it

631
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,320
those robert is inspected

632
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:27,320
worst as it happens at optimizing ground
keep

633
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:32,200
some other bills just maybe look taller
because

634
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:36,050
Bernard sometimes you can just

635
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:40,160
miss some on their builders not all the
pathways

636
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:45,620
have dangers transactions and a

637
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:48,760
are not something the whole

638
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,480
whole graph is not available at any
point in time

639
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,690
and its it's there

640
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:58,810
only to the extent specific current

641
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:05,540
Tasco denounces are

642
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:09,040

over this loner villages then they stop

650
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,270
the use of such symbols for this
parameter but it's not attach percent

651
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:42,290
you can just go around commanding

652
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:45,520
untie them bowed when you were single

653

654
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:53,880
and operational percent times I mean

655
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:59,090
I mean to patch that applies to cold who
you described it took a reckless

656
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:04,390
integration application firewall best
way it works and destroy this one

657
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:07,950
d witnesses that it doesn't take into
consideration

658
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:11,440
her so then a lot of values earned it

659
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,830
may occur and during and

660
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:17,990
dangerous and there's this and
applications

661
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:23,530
factor of questions for this world
version

662
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:27,290
shop around rough conduct we up

663
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:30,730
park board no one knows how to herschel

664
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:35,580
patch controversial batch to anything

665
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:40,210
period

666
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:43,700
patching is a link on re: this

667
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:46,910
security scans not received much

668
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:51,810
trying maybe this period hirschfeld

669
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:56,820
file the school captured

670
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:59,990
train differently much I was reading
wish

671
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:04,010
Russian immersion training should done
jointly with scanner

672
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:07,130
certification my world so was

673
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:12,370
ok so much so many years to

674
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:16,780
tell you everything ascend as I think
that we do have

675
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:21,060
isn't

676
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:26,290
which which sport stop bicycle we can be
counted

677
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:36,250
care will what show

678
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:40,780
special thank you presentation

679
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:46,210
about that priorities your it expected

680
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:53,340
question yeah good

681
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:57,000
hear it spoken 2013

682
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,080
dead workshop

683
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:03,080
said

684
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:06,700
generally the priority his related

685
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:11,510
to what's going to happen to this cold
future because he was still typing

686
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:14,710
got to find something to entry point

687
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:18,870
a certain variable state that if I did

688
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:23,150
was arson example censored and developer
wants to add another branch

689
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:29,470
and so that's another entry point on in
the mains

690
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:32,720
him to me hosts on

691
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,010
then he can just do it defiant terrible

692
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:39,450
and and get those little so

693
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:43,960
pieces and a safe flight to Amsterdam
and so that is why I S

694
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,570
just implement against

695
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:49,110
validation

696
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:52,320
has when the most pleasant

697
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,920
think priority in ass said

698
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:00,500
conditions not only because good content
matter because it forces

699
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:04,190
to stop the operation of

700
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:07,550
the application and change the graphics
and thus

701
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:10,990
queen size are not concise good with the
policy

702
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:15,950
and or just throughout the application
or not just to follow

703
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:19,130
branch that this dangers send send

704
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:23,320
sanitizing can help you then

705
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:27,750
because services just this moment

706
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:30,860
ties in may help and

707
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:34,340
nuclear weapon

708
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:38,070
can just always find us

709
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:41,960
on the internet about us with patient

710
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:45,570
some questions I'm first question

711
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:49,770
practical worship

712
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:52,890
HTML countries done by typing

713
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:56,260
can you do it through around her

714
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:56,970
around

715
00:47:56,970 --> 00:48:00,180
station talk about asp.net

716
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:04,640
response.write its should

717
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,150
service solutions deeper so then

718
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:11,289
holders apso server line is

719
00:48:11,289 --> 00:48:17,670
his symbol based so then the opening
bracket and the closing brackets

720
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:21,910
much later and that this that

721
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:25,700
temple templating temp later

722
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:32,630
so then some say no aunt

723
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:36,049
specifications two options sorry there
have the

724
00:48:36,049 --> 00:48:39,239
the initial initial for modesty later

725
00:48:39,239 --> 00:48:44,829
who were we the temp later for partial

726
00:48:44,829 --> 00:48:49,619
realization implementation and and your
candor

727
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:54,529
printing to function Tampa later faces
phase

728
00:48:54,529 --> 00:48:58,989
1000 values and then 100 basis then
tried

729
00:48:58,989 --> 00:49:04,299
around it overs them but there's apply
it to the template oratorical

730
00:49:04,299 --> 00:49:09,049
him in 10 person cases than 10 percent
cases

731
00:49:09,049 --> 00:49:12,150
so this is facing is phasing a quasi
freezing

732
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:15,420
and that might might work torrent in
person

733
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:21,599
up 10 percent times so than

734
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,830
my friend spoke about

735
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:30,100
your patching chill

736
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:34,070
personal organization testimony

737
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:38,300
called and you look for dish magic
simple right or you'd

738
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,380
she's physically

739
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:43,630
want stem

740
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:47,579
watching on your door patching

741
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:51,319
you look for a complex in which value

742
00:49:51,319 --> 00:49:54,430
are entry veridical yes

743
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:58,130
so the line glow his glued together and
and

744
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:02,540
parse for me and endorse

745
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:06,420
this magical ingredient money isn't

746
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:10,710
way out there essay form his

747
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:14,470
the variational essay for no work with
initial text

748
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:17,869
we did week interpret the initial

749
00:50:17,869 --> 00:50:22,270
texted SSA provides for an intermediary

750
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:25,549
image so what does

751
00:50:25,549 --> 00:50:29,680
plenary my binder but its

752
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:34,460
side you have had the foresight to

753
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:37,540
rebuilt I stared into it I stare

754
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:41,570
and then we have a assimilated

755
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:45,490
or challenge lamb so helped implement
agers

756
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:48,580
we and and is ice-t's

757
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:53,200
his interpreters ice-t_ the churn to
change into this graph and

758
00:50:53,200 --> 00:51:05,440
and understand to working with the graph

759
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,890
K questions

760
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:07,640
thank you
