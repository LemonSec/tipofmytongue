either the Gators ok to use basis and
other

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,260

57
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,910
which compliance typable its virtual but
education

58
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,570
and edition supe

59
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,920
2.2 national was taken as a business
owner feels weird

60
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,959

location

62
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:07,650
cuz value this feels cross between it

63
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,450
each other so even

64
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,920
in one record is russian-language

65
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,970
version of the product other refers to
its modification

66
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:23,389
this structure loves to

67
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:27,110
make selection from their abilities and
for the crackers

68
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,810
in one requests and also through T
bennett's parameters

69
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,850
is possible to quickly fine

70
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,940
will the route is

71
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:42,550
having only two products in the System
Center that parameter can see

72
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,789
butter this product is vulnerable

73
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:50,100
completely or only if it has not brought
up

74
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,690
to that's two examples light the record

75
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:58,080

76
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,479
rose a snow will double to proponent
two's

77
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,550
simple and second progression to be
informed

78
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,770
Benson having products 5&6 therefore

79
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:13,940

80
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,860

00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,280
it's one for 15 6 to

83
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,949
I ment demands blunders too so we
clearly did try with the proposal

84
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:30,120
included other no

85
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,919
for 20 there's no dependency for one

86
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,599
is on longer pulled products and for

87
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:40,690

89
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,320

93
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,610
server so the problem says through W SD

94
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,540
ill why we don't believe that of course
we

95
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:14,160
so did not stop at that very little
numbers database and at the end

96
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,490
we are implementing integrated

99
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,140

contains

100
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,370
record a products upon their abilities
and exploits exploits

101
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,720
are sold money they're not no pictures
but they show

102
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,860
products at its most irrelevant and
could be

103
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,460
some details of implementation

104
00:06:54,460 --> 00:07:01,430
this factor last honest and narcissist
some having certain product there's

105
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,840

106
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,870
spratt

107
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,360
using this product that is a model who
access to the dayton where

and the distortion input as product
standard

109
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,570
both from the to rate this product and
under the indicators

110
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:26,490
you have a record search Wilner

based and then

112
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:31,990
on the winner but it is intricate as you
can see which exploits exist

113
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:36,670

there's a moment so far there is no

167
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:51,230
access to that personal computer thank
you much a question

168
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:55,280
hello

169
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,930
who think who's the main

170
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:01,900
audience for consuming up for your
products

171
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,990
their base develop fully automatic

172
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:11,200
fanaticism of secure is so eager to use
our cells were because you were

173
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,770
developed the system

174
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:16,500
protecting against one against

175
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,600
infrastructure networks

176
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,420
merrily have information about
configurations of products

177
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:29,190
and the moesha

178
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:33,730
repairs disc wish for a better base to
see what a little too they have

179
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:37,440
lemme x-men my point to you love I've
been

180
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:44,780
into that the several months myself as a
developer cause a problem

181
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:51,200
and Syrian is that many to be the
components

182
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,890
software components have you know
product

183
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:59,390
like Windows I don't know look at 7:00

184
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,400
but if you have the application which
uses the

185
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,320
suffer component Lipsy or Joe component

186
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,430
versions whatever that

187
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:14,850
bath is not

188
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:18,930
the laid several commercial companies
are developing this

189
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:24,130
but this serious requires a lot of
investments

190
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:28,250
money there are some open products
victims separate hun

191
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:32,420
work with and others so far

192
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:37,970
the are cover it

193
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:41,759
very little percentage low percentage do
you have any ideas about

194
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,879
hard to move this way to help developers
because

195
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:50,790
Eve in the infrastructure there are
applications that somebody

196
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:54,069
already developing urinalysis will give
nothing more

197
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:58,769
you feel a little human Wilner abilities
in the plug-ins or

198
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:03,980
human

199
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:08,560
will never build and plug-ins or what in
libraries grows up

200
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:14,009
okay innocent in the sewer and former

201
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:17,110
speech and he should have been on the
million

202
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,980
not does the version

203
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,180
the name needs to be mentioned it does

204
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:29,800
patches I'll what

205
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,009
models are touched

206
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:36,139
my dispatches even we have this

207
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:42,029
dictionary

208
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:46,089
read on yes manual work you cannot did

209
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:50,889
and monitoring right main purpose for
product is to help administrators

210
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:53,959
no main purpose is to

211
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:57,509
make it automatic not as administrators

212
00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:02,309
check all the databases spagnolo

213
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:05,519
but rather make comparisons at american
search

214
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,290
more vulnerable to saundra lists brewery

215
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,300
modeled there is the software which

216
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,529
collects date about is no person than
simply

217
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:20,949
get it and the bring it to the analysis
system

218
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:24,040
what I wanted cezanne to work for

219
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,759
big box products you have any
implications

220
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:31,389
were develop using standard

221
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:37,820
setup owner loses possible it is a

222
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,590
boolfalse to reduce when there's a
negative

223
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:45,950
the two winners ill Liberty could be
identified

224
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:51,350
these scanners will need a bill to
scanners

225
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,830
it could not be identified through

226
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:58,930
automatic matters because that's not
quite precise some

227
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:08,370
possibly below the crucial

228
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:16,080
which experts time please was gonna pick
standart

229
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,160
back complacent and

230
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,529
is also in Russia database based on
stuck

231
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:26,890
as a

232
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:31,050
tho Kratz space

233
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:34,110
can the us say

234
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:37,480
the any link between the senate and the
stats

235
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,570
stack their baby was issued recently

236
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:46,750
that's clear political said yesterday
that there are going to classify

237
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,900
interesting

238
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,589
Monday says is going to be in 2016

239
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:54,970
would be realistic based on these

240
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:58,610
Metro stand to build up the description

241
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:03,200
all these threats and then

242
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,390
link them with vulnerabilities

243
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:11,610
can use integrate your universal base
with their

244
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:15,300
when they removed if we have any

245
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,300
identification others

246
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:23,309
source cross-links or sources or experts
at least wood products of course we will

247
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:24,900
be able to integrate that

248
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:31,870
in the future

249
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:35,050
soon as I have their own former bullet
to see

250
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:40,420
then yes of course two-degree can ask
another question

251
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:44,620
first one she product configuration

252
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,720
but find out which former doesn't

253
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:59,490
CP 2.2 up

254
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,170
police a product to sent

255
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:06,680
to the moesha processing some utilities

256
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:12,560
that yes sure in about CWP

257
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,070
100 plan to use them with this is

258
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,850
your in the CW he

259
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:24,110
there are references not to Olu Wilner
builders but

260
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:28,040
to weaknesses cell on

261
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,810
step

262
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:36,430
this war for classification purposes

263
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:42,430
or they have some unique wreckers in CW
either is the

264
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:53,490
at its peak it is so it's possible to
link k thanks

265
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:56,130
number 0

266
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:04,350
will build is in the subgroup initial
slide unique record product records

267
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:10,120
number of products how can you well-read
wreckers were shown in your database

268
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,500
fun number of software products that's

269
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:20,190
the results 22,000 wreckers remain
softwares

270
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:24,049
yes with

271
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:27,590
when we talk about 10,000 software
products while products

272
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:31,549
is it for

273
00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:40,020
experts no up

274
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:44,669
dis for experts they have web interface
and for asthmatics s

275
00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:49,570
is still serves little about tens of
thousands of trekkers

276
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:52,750
spoke the crackers really to

277
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,650
systematized at bring this into order
the sioux details

278
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:00,289
haven't to resolve this problem you're
has same

279
00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:03,669
product could be represented under
different names

280
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:06,700
you havent

281
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,039
graphics differently not get

282
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:13,150
level information about the London Buses
the to

283
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:17,590
work hard database her planning to do
you have any

284
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,840
records is which is a smartphone the
rebels is example

285
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,200
to open it up see you there are less
vulnerable products

286
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,840
Janice tan a rich now refer you present
producer we give its own edification

287
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:36,409
safety bring together products or merge
products and CP

288
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:40,220
there's certain products and

289
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:43,850
we choose have separate producers

290
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,870
table if you wanna see which products

291
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,110
some vulnerable particular producer
vendor who make

292
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:56,860
is sample I'm not mistaken had about
1500 producers

293
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,929
product about 15 or

294
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:04,730
20,000 gold 20 to

295
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,159
broke records are processed manually no
no

296
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,950
how to guarantee that is not obligated
records compare

297
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:16,340
mandolin no automatic house

298
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:20,309
unloading stage love the data

299
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:23,870
compare the data

300
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:28,630
rate available smaller and record

301
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:40,870
producers call like this human error in
a text

302
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:43,540
I mean those must be intellectual

303
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:47,580
analysis of vulnerability dates because
the volume is quite high

304
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,120
if a person's needs to work with that
this

305
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,200
person will not be able to analyze this
slaughter

306
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:59,670
amount of data so far we do not process
the

307
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:11,460
errors thank you is going to be
available through web interface

308
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,900
it is currently available through to me
yes to me

309
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,180
but we'd haven't put and over access

310
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:22,470
are you going to do that yes I plan to
do any minute

311
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:26,760
monetization service no

312
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,050
school

313
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:34,340
when we are going to find out about
launchers serves as soon as a launch

314
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:34,860
title

315
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:43,750
informant thank you

316
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,540
your attention
