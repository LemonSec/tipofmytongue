1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,450
effect so but I we're going to speak
about

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:26,810
you all No

3
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,260
guzzles that

4
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,630
better you or perhaps know that in
addition to development analysis means

5
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,780
in our company we

6
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,400
do a lot of penetration testing and we
declare

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,520
it to market and our clients that guy's

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,870
for us it's not away to on my knee
because the profit from

9
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,100
nutrition test compared to selling next
battle in other ones

10
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,140
it's a of percentage for us the pen
testing

11
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,360
is festival lets your for the research

12
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:01,400
which vulnerabilities we discover

13
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,110
in information system or the client how
the seven their abilities can be used in

14
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:09,409
only to break had and hacker

15
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:12,930
the information systems our clients why

16
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,920
the celebrities are produced a how came
to will remove them how can we work with

17
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,150
them this this and this and this

18
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,180
so this is a mature which congress I the
importer to the analytics

19
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:26,240
so that day cool a little different
nations for the solutions we should

20
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,880
develop that

21
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,990
our programmers 36 of such pro- projects

22
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,270
we are publishing consumption forget to
get this it is a very similar

23
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,260
ninety percent of Ben testings and guess
what the main objective is to get

24
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:37,920
control

25
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,560
over local welcome people love the a
client although the

26
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,080
certain IT system 90 or 100 percent of
such projects

27
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,810
i coming to you that getting his control
in two cases I love to read

28
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,560
only to break the system and become the
domain administrator

29
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,670
deeply in their local and network you
should leave the

30
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,540
office all the time so the terror is
appreciated from outside then you get

31
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,570
control over certain

32
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:05,030
a points inside network and then
practically all guys

33
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:09,369
well actually of has become in Chile
violators for this particular network

34
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:14,370
by perhaps in 2003 percentages of the
cases we are not able to get a full

35
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,620
control but very often it doesn't mean
that the system is protected and

36
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,950
defended but we just have Regis Corp

37
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,510
for example I the perimeter you can see
what doesn't Corsair

38
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,819
you attack on the two of them a the rest
of them don't buy some even though

39
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:30,500
they have abilities so

40
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,250
with this in mind what do we see

41
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,750
those networking perimeter which is
viewed

42
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,680
us some kinda were all a chain is really
gives a local network a decline and to

43
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,470
protect the period they invest made
among some money

44
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:49,470
in addition to a simple thing sir like a

45
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,750
domain authentication other things so it
will be seen if I wold Application

46
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,640
Firewall

47
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,030
I D S key and every wish has to be able
to help us to

48
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:03,910
discovered a hacker attack no less
approximately ninety percent of cases

49
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,489
doing it has been penetrated and a half

50
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:10,650
percent 6 percent about work is a

51
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:16,019
had we break it hurt to availability is
up but the vacations or by brutality of

52
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,269
the past water to the face is in other
cases we have to use social

53
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:23,069
their social science works all the time
and has never failed us

54
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:27,260
and we'll never had a case so when will
enable there to find uses inside on the

55
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:27,989
network will

56
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:32,500
open I letter that was sent to them and
this user other working place will

57
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,709
always have a certain number of the
abilities which will help us to get

58
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:36,130
control

59
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:40,400
over his computer but this in mind

60
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,709
it out six to seven years ago in order
to braid information system

61
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:51,299
one had to strongly to update all set
for himself in order to analyze the ear

62
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,079
protectors of the a WiFi network you had
to compile

63
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:57,239
at the Linux occurring all than

64
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,190
you shoot a tune up by the drivers of
the wireless cats right note also the

65
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,620
source

66
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,440
same all that even a schoolboy can work
with where the case when they're

67
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,069
I've been speaking with a pen tester
girl with a good experience of doing

68
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:10,260
bent SN the

69
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,129
she was telling how she was a kitchen
password say

70
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:18,859
in the network and by staff can rely
plays the ball here I they had a bad

71
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:19,349
words

72
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:22,960
so it's of putting how talking how does
it work

73
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,139
I don't know she didn't even know how
the practical it's in that this bill how

74
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:26,830
it works

75
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,870
why it works this way: she just press is
the bottom and she's a profit hot

76
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,270
in some cases in which hopefully have to
work a lot but nevertheless

77
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:38,800
especially in order to

78
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,430
heading the access to the router to
reveal the tree of God

79
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,479
rising in the network it's not the basic
objective and this can be done only by

80
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,319
qualified specialist with this in mind

81
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:51,800
when we do work

82
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,250
well the class of course knows that ban
tests will be done

83
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,360
and it will be done in this peer the
famine of course eighty guys

84
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,909
they don't want to fail and they try to
do their busy try to know

85
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:05,080
that isn't hatter's and they try to walk
stop them

86
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,770
but with this in mind depend s
activities they can be discovered only

87
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,129
two percent of the cases

88
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:13,940
and very often result of accidents for
example we've been but was it the bus

89
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,229
was

90
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:18,190
an account has been stabbed but haven't
I got itself in the curtain movement

91
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,240
away to redirect the tracking set up the
network and traffic

92
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,460
just step moving everybody started
cleaning up what did happen

93
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:29,110
your specials like the client has ideas
has seen as a lot of mean sir

94
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,349
and interest that we should help them
took a staggered back at the early

95
00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:32,940
stages

96
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,479
they don't work and organ organizer

97
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,699
contributing Regency white lady attack
has been noticed that the

98
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:43,699
early-stage damn day started alarm

99
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:48,029
and people have determined what really
happens and what does it come from

100
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:51,849
and what is to be done in order to stop
the sale a in criminal activity there

101
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:52,659
were cases

102
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:57,150
when in server room they have to be at
work in the server room

103
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:01,960
PS his console he turns up something and
then she says message a and screen

104
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:07,710
Metasploit message window Aug ice
already at work inside America

105
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,750
remotely and she sees some strange
numbers right into it he get scared away

106
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,849
he realized the server without telling
anybody

107
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:18,300
about it security guys learned about it
from

108
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,080
us because you see guys see the summer
was reloaded where she learned that it

109
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,669
was not a

110
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:27,370
and we informed them that this activity
did happen even though it should be a

111
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:27,979
vice versa

112
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:32,940
security guys should tell us hey guys
where noted you the set of problems that

113
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,650
we see on the sidelines

114
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:39,199
is the similar so the problems and as a
result of the pen testing

115
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,310
I'll we can this would be good love
probability

116
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:46,110
weekend tell me in advance so the
results of these a little bit as well

117
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:49,599
by publication it's a common problem the
problem of passwords and protection 3

118
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,349
percent to

119
00:06:50,349 --> 00:06:51,090
in

120
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:54,980
company respectively to how well you
have set up the policy the company

121
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:59,150
and publicity of the bus was 3xl abuses

122
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:02,690
due to different reasons they use what
passwords for example

123
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,419
administrator has given this possible to
them they don't change it

124
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:09,600
also use age

125
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,770
of unprotected protocols inside network
at least for example

126
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,040
to Candace assist guys this is Kat has
two a

127
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,970
administer to Association not to let ann
fucked sometimes they don't send why

128
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,080
this should be done

129
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,080
et cetera et cetera et cetera so making
a resume

130
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,900
of having said above we know in advance
which set of problems

131
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:35,490
we should've errors are done by people
who create a network create information

132
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,669
system exploding

133
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:42,220
and we as a rule in advance do know how
can we use these problems in

134
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:46,229
order to penetrate this network the same
time

135
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:50,330
this is a technical side of the question
but does also ideological saddam

136
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,449
questionable why the

137
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:54,639
depending side cannot is not able and

138
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,150
is not able to fight against the hackers
attack one of the promise incidence you

139
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,650
spot a special for the company's

140
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:03,750
debutant the defending side doesn't know
but they should defend

141
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:08,270
the security guy have the big banks he
knows that he has the EDS

142
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,760
at the main a money making system you
know all there pass was and she knows

143
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,960
nothing about these vacancies

144
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,169
a departure Q nos that you guys have
told him to list on the service which

145
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:17,639
other part of this information system

146
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:22,110
gay ass banking financial system and
feels that the system is

147
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:26,620
made on the DS or 4.4 and but which
models are part of the season he knows

148
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,990
nothing about it antique

149
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:32,120
headlock let alone to use them Andheri
of to lead the defending signed doesn't

150
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,830
know but we should for missional close

151
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,260
I love running between the service so
which relations permitted and which

152
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,820
on North but made in which has to be
looked at as a lawless which data is

153
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,560
being transferred

154
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:47,100
which a router so and committees are
using in the process of trying to get at

155
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,490
cetera et cetera et cetera

156
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:51,839
very after security guys in the company

157
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,839
learn about the

158
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,080
how the system so well they learn up for
my best event SS

159
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,340
when they have analyzed after the pen
tester post then test analysis

160
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,820
but this is one side of the problems
they consider the problem is that

161
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,110
defending side very often doesn't know
how the attacker

162
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,590
behaves they are reduced to love the by
lets you see a hacker can

163
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:18,890
well let me the project in patients is a
hacker can find other ability net

164
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:23,800
well long the source code hiker can find
a lil sis in it

165
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,690
but which dole said has been used which
possibility Tiger does have an ad which

166
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,530
doesn't have

167
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:33,020
he doesn't know we said our activities
usually has been taken by for example

168
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,340
it doesn't the cation as well on taxable
abilities and hi all

169
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:41,020
can you find a SQL injection and how to
exploit it and we ship that locks will

170
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:45,160
stay after the Securities well did
spending side does not know about those

171
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,610
things

172
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:49,610
sold a set of tools which is needed to
discover

173
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:52,980
hecka attack is available but idk how is
not notice until the moment

174
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,450
when somebody ple not inform hey guys
debate

175
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:01,490
proper was defaced and your money are
living to clients accounts and you don't

176
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:02,420
know about that

177
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:07,590
so to say that

178
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,890
the root of all these problems the firm
has ruled in fact that the reaction to a

179
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,900
tax appraisal is different from previous
antique attacks

180
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,880
and is usually security guys are the
defined for the second one

181
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,560
in order to prevent that working attacks
against other protocols its enough to

182
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,690
put the file which

183
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,970
will cut out and ninety percent of the
available products by ten will still

184
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:26,360
state

185
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,720
but in the case with reacting to it said
its it doesn't work

186
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,890
you can't defend yourself only from
dole's you can correctly react only to

187
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:34,980
those incidents

188
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,090
which you are ready for you do

189
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:41,950
know how to the de dos attack is being
done so you have been thinking about

190
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:46,000
where you have located and where you
place the census in which attacks ok US

191
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,150
from the senses you will perceive

192
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:50,940
as a long standard ones will work in
addition to object to that thank you

193
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,170
don't just need

194
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:56,450
to a problem noted that also have to
know the what is to be done

195
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:00,840
who should be a raised and how much time
do you have

196
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,900
in order to reacted to remove that tag
before

197
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,080
the network will fall so you have to
know three things:

198
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,670
in order to properly organize the
reacting to thank you should know

199
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,780
what are you protecting how's your
information system is built in

200
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,760
from which a political

201
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,790
is from who you defend yourself with the
violator and you should also know

202
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:23,640
which set up signs you should perceive

203
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,790
as the effect of attack and I shouldn't
difficult issue because

204
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:30,780
if you if you will react to

205
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,630
everything you have too many false
positives and at the N double tell you

206
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:38,100
hey guys you just take a lot about %ah
nothing happens

207
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,230
Barack if you will have a very high
threshold

208
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:46,350
you will the as death tax and their
reaction to incidents will not be

209
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,090
affected as well

210
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:51,890
so as a consequence what do we do right
now we are developing the

211
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:55,840
product line which helps you to solve
all these problems well I'm not going to

212
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,570
advertise them

213
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:59,840
we have knows them talk less but the
main principles which are in building

214
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,750
their operations well I'm going to tell
you about them

215
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:08,510
so the first that we face when we
communicate we

216
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:13,440
that like the our clients with Debbie
com competent security guys could do no

217
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,420
in principle

218
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,460
but it will be gay and from who don't
insult but it's been 20 percent eighty

219
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,390
percent of the company's

220
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,740
when we talk to them or we face

221
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,180
situation so very commits that well of
see some

222
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:31,250
is isolated from the sole world well I
can't believe that but I'm still

223
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,050
speaking you know from experience when
real life

224
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:37,480
I can see the different situation war
want to speak that

225
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,840
common user can be to rate the traffic

226
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,850
and find the password of the user they
say well

227
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:48,870
her I use a slot so competent to do that
even though I know several accountants

228
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,770
who'd been entertaining themselves

229
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,650
at that from their colleagues and
accounting they've been cashing their

230
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,440
passwords

231
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,140
of contact the other question he and
other social systems yet there were a

232
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:01,670
a sisters and their relatives of our
employees but less

233
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:05,000
a disqualification is sufficient

234
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,160
and you can expect it from different
people in a fantastic group

235
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,220
but we did have a very qualified
specialist cool by his education it was

236
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:13,700
a

237
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:18,500
financial revisa look at you guys in a
break it was his hobby that he was a

238
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,770
adding during his free time

239
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:27,720
so by the machine reality the production
management system we see that does

240
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,560
office segment everything in seventy
Lancer

241
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,790
and processing of classic costs or

242
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:39,149
system suppression a separate deal and
there was no routing between them

243
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:44,190
and client taints that as its relation
is impossible

244
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,290
and computer tech salting possible well
the

245
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,640
apology does not believe them for that
but you look at the Sir admitted process

246
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,339
control system

247
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:54,730
well carefully you'll see that in office
in the land as administrator

248
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,020
who just too lazy to run from one
building to another to reach you

249
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,470
reset the server so his workstation he
was added to the same

250
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:05,330
the land where the uninitiated season is
located yes direct routing between the

251
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,920
sisters is not available but his Russian
became trying to clean them so we get to

252
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,899
control this mission

253
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:13,680
and the next step well-read have the

254
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,350
networking access to the Scottish system
hello semantics

255
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,870
hello Honeywell hello the abilities that
you have

256
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:24,560
which are well known since nineteen
nineties any or operating systems

257
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,250
of but these particular vendors as a
result it happens that

258
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,910
representation of the system as it is
seen by the client

259
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:35,820
and operator the system while looking at
a networking schemes looking at the

260
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,880
presentation

261
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,020
it's really different from what is
available in reality

262
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,160
due to the same a human factor mistakes

263
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,209
laziness et cetera so in order to defend
yourself you should

264
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:50,670
understand that the CEA by 11 attack is
a normal thing in life

265
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:54,089
and that in a second W sugar somehow

266
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:58,209
really the equipment is been preset in
your company in it whether this

267
00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:01,510
attack East possible which is the route
of the attack

268
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:05,350
so it was only if you will look at
certain

269
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:09,089
a less more less cumbersome position you
will be able to see that there's a lot

270
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:10,350
to enter points out there

271
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:14,529
and at different for example sick
industrial company

272
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:22,400
they have a segment of production
process management

273
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,830
week expecting arm 100 by later we
expect that

274
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:29,430
evil Buddha hot gas

275
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:35,400
will have a desire tool local or
international conflict and somebody like

276
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:35,900
to make it

277
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:41,180
diversion attack and other speaking the
stress also should be looked upon

278
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,920
but have less which are possible ways of
tackling this issue while the

279
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,300
stupidest way is get connected to a
telecom channels

280
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,610
in the segment of EPCs timid proscar
soul sisters

281
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:56,130
or the equipment is being transferred to
the wireless Management so using

282
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:59,640
those Wireless a protocols as a rule
they

283
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,930
in principle they don't have any
mechanisms for protection because

284
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:03,560
festival

285
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,000
day i connect for the speed of data
transfer in the position of Julie

286
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,030
this is the obvious most obvious way it
doesn't work pay off because they ok

287
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:13,180
is controlled zone I said which

288
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,400
ready signal you will not be able to
catch it and you'll not get access to

289
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,110
the races

290
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:21,090
but nevertheless okay you gonna do it
directly to office networking

291
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,550
theoretically it is separated from this
segment

292
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:27,560
all for the automated process control
system but the same human factor

293
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,880
rowley said up a firewall

294
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,130
machines which become trunking between
two networks et cetera et cetera

295
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:39,110
so we get access to the of a segment for
example in a result of the soul attack

296
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:44,760
or if a your employer the same company
then as you go to the signal of BCS

297
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,300
ultimate price control system and for
the management of the country the use

298
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:47,940
curious

299
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,690
the where the terminus at work in kiosk
more in the kiosk

300
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:56,750
and user it cannot do anything clever
with them he has the interface and he

301
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,740
doesn't know what is permitted but its
interest but as laudable abilities which

302
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,390
allowed to get

303
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:04,150
around the circle small to get to the
command line one

304
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:07,470
use these terminal as a regular computer

305
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:10,839
if you cannot do this way there's more
complex way

306
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:14,380
the attack from outside with the uses of
social engineering

307
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,600
led to the desktops other every segment
or

308
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,760
with the usage of the ability to buy
publications or

309
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,810
Harris in the remote access settings

310
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:29,060
on the channel service of segment as a
result attack against the

311
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,910
attack against the and

312
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:36,490
automated to princess I will do that
that's

313
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:40,049
against well liabilities therefore

314
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:43,559
in order to moral behavior on the
violator

315
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:47,860
his you have to know the set typical
vulnerabilities you should know how they

316
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,620
are being used

317
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:52,250
and no which tool set should be used by
hackers

318
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:56,679
again zev and the parliament know she's
a very big one and reply simplification

319
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:58,140
so what do you know

320
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,490
about violators when we read when the

321
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,710
read certain model of threats I some
commercial company or the state

322
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,980
transition we do see

323
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:11,330
that violators can be employees have
special services we choose ken

324
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:15,419
in Thursday producer and put a certain

325
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:20,040
insert sector in soaked into the
equipment or into the operating system

326
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,900
well in the practice in real life

327
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,710
when we truly want to build normal
reaction

328
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,860
to threats as the head of

329
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,120
my pics company have told be practical

330
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,960
he said we should look at some practical
assumptions

331
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,100
you can assume that the attacker

332
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,240
will usurp some clever possibilities in

333
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,390
clever software but that we should come
within social depth by later is

334
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:51,559
20-30 year ok young person with a very
high level of curiosity and he uses to

335
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:53,679
all set which can be freely downloaded

336
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,030
all you can buy for very a small money
but yes

337
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:01,210
these tools can be expensive but its in
three

338
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:04,910
distribution of course with certain
assumptions so eat

339
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,210
we will take for this is despite your
assumption them

340
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:12,020
the tool said that has been used by the
hiker becomes understandable

341
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:16,590
their Metasploit highly converse
sunsport

342
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:21,669
well-known said of export backs with all
mod con 10

343
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:26,960
with well-known exploits the and Belmont
the liabilities plus tools

344
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,960
of binder & alice is our fathers or the
analysis of the socks or scores

345
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,460
but once again there is a certain set up
with a gorgeous which are used there's

346
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,000
no magic beyond it those nor

347
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,480
magic behind it so when a person looks
and finds the numbers you know there's a

348
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,050
certain set of templates

349
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,050
you enter to a certain side to

350
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:50,050
which is well described in the

351
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:54,140
articles a binary in all this is a of
ice as such for

352
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,160
their availability is a before overflow

353
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,510
total phasing et cetera et cetera et
cetera yes

354
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:03,650
I will not repeat just I'm not high I'm
analytic

355
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:08,320
but not less I can least all this method
in I do know proximately

356
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,330
bleach the traces are left

357
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:14,810
after using those so hair tools

358
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:18,870
with this in mind told why not

359
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:23,470
dependence i forgets about is that when
we're getting ready to react to the heck

360
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:23,910
is that

361
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:27,330
we should know that I guess so has
certain objective he's not just

362
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,530
in vain raises he wants to get something
out of it very

363
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:33,650
often the attack is building a

364
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:39,040
come away stepmom one get access to
anything and then to the weakest points

365
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,790
and he said we close with a web server

366
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:44,000
summers ever desktop overuse it because
you can easy to get

367
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,040
Inc connection with the then develop
that track and then that too well on

368
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,520
ways

369
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,880
is to increase your privileges by using
look at their own abilities

370
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,670
become adminstrator or by using are
sporting

371
00:20:55,670 --> 00:21:00,140
a taxer DHCP said the

372
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,930
the redirect the traffic to it then
catch a pass word on the street is an

373
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:04,990
other privileged users

374
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,930
and then use those passwords to get
access to the information resources

375
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:08,900
that's it we begin

376
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,170
into press administrator or that mean
all the Cisco a

377
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,340
and the system is hours and weekend with
everyone but the system no jet is

378
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,120
understandable

379
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:21,840
results are understandable tools are in
understandable this is one sided the

380
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,330
Commission the second set up the
question is what are we protecting

381
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:28,430
and there was a problem here the problem
is

382
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:32,790
following the different people who are
interested indicating their system

383
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:35,890
and a different look at it for the
business at the threat is

384
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:39,010
losing money before and even the
exclusive

385
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:42,320
losing at the money sometimes a lot of
their reputation but it's still awesome

386
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:42,950
the money

387
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:46,790
but indirectly IT guys fought them

388
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:50,340
it is important that the operability of
the operation system they don't really

389
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:50,880
know but the

390
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,490
financial part I'll the the a national
coach was but they don't know if this

391
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:56,799
ever will fail

392
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:02,279
them the best case somebody will be
fired security guy things in the terms

393
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,370
of a wat share

394
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:09,460
have been talkin confidentiality
relation:private so information

395
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:14,240
availability and some people no promises
like integrity reporting

396
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,200
et cetera et cetera hecka and guests are
or hacker

397
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,940
attacker he faced only differently in
different getting a similar abilities

398
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,200
attack result develop a love the attack

399
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,059
and what s result and in order to
understand

400
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:33,720
what do we protect them from room all
these approaches have to be united

401
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,619
somehow

402
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:38,340
cut how can these be done of course
NaturallySpeaking

403
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,749
we should start looking at the season we
I saw the business because it

404
00:22:41,749 --> 00:22:45,749
makes no sense to protect the test
system effect has no influence any

405
00:22:45,749 --> 00:22:49,259
and that attack against it will not lead
to anything yes agree

406
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:53,110
call without you therefore festival we
should understand which information

407
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:57,039
system should be protected and which
have them

408
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,749
are important step number one which
information systems are

409
00:23:00,749 --> 00:23:03,919
interesting for the business and they
have to protect step number two which

410
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:04,740
have the systems

411
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:08,429
can really be interesting to actor for
example the system reporting for the

412
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:08,809
bank

413
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:13,059
sister reporting letter to the central
bank is very important that person in

414
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:16,369
the reporting for two days in advance
well this is the year foundation

415
00:23:16,369 --> 00:23:20,690
also cancelled the licence for the hike
it makes no sense to break the system if

416
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,860
it will not become the intermediate
stage

417
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:28,100
for attacking the remote banking
services system so

418
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:32,830
first double we have to look at the
business we should look at business

419
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,999
results and then we should identify the
main information systems

420
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:39,789
step number two we should look at the
season with the I sold at: guy

421
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:43,409
we have identify system yes very good
then we should understand

422
00:23:43,409 --> 00:23:46,649
from which said this it consists

423
00:23:46,649 --> 00:23:49,820
which information flows are running
between them et cetera

424
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:55,610
step number three we should look at this
isn't with guys attackers

425
00:23:55,610 --> 00:24:00,269
because once again in that perception of
those people who develop dnt fans

426
00:24:00,269 --> 00:24:05,279
it gets you into hi care looks at how
the financial system is built and he

427
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,309
knows we church

428
00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:09,110
Joyce to attack which was attacked but
it

429
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:12,700
is nothing for the attacker attacks it
was a black box which he doesn't know

430
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,429
how it's bill

431
00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:17,900
for him is just a set of router s
service working stations

432
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,559
first step he attacks something

433
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:24,679
which is that they're both second step
he

434
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:27,740
attacks its neighbors gets control

435
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,780
and step by step he gets more and more
control

436
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,290
and in order to get a complete control
this is he starts to understand

437
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:38,280
which property can get from this all
this is that Republican says system

438
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:43,960
and I the government made up the system
I will say that was a

439
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,900
fun and it is but my favorite incident
in the year two 2012

440
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,880
it wasn't a gainst while the American
processing banks

441
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,410
when the attack was on the following way
so the guys sitting at their apartment

442
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:00,100
from a fortune 200 magazine they took a
least

443
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:04,540
all for the most reach processing
companies

444
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:09,200
then they want to the internet said they
found vulnerabilities a web publications

445
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,140
then he got inside and then suddenly
they control traffic but they'd

446
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:18,150
know nothing what to do with it they
start it looking for colleagues who

447
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,900
could write specifics the first

448
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,760
sniffer which call would not just listen
to the traffic but define

449
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,120
transfer all of our car dams and then
pull these dams

450
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,570
they were not ready for getting control
over the informational

451
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:35,620
flaws with the car dams which could be
sold it on the black market

452
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,760
so for them to seize the initiative was
a black box with

453
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:43,020
week interface which they could use so
respectively Eve

454
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:46,530
at the moment of one thing the defense

455
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:52,390
we should bring together two approaches
so look in the system

456
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:56,020
from bottom up we should identify the
key points of

457
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:00,340
entry Kia available location so for the
client help

458
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:04,429
and then we should look at the system
but a proper lol we have always sOooo

459
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:05,580
used by the company

460
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,640
hardware so in order to get or control
over these key entry points we can use

461
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,580
these these these desktops these are
rudderless these particular service

462
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,600
about for example

463
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:19,220
for the same test server which ideally
is not interesting for the hackers

464
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,799
can do the kitten same feel and oz au

465
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:25,190
everyone making service ever civil state
and the

466
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:28,740
de la creme calculators there look at
the same segment with a credit card

467
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,880
later because

468
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,029
for the business it's not interesting
it's vulnerable

469
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:36,899
we get control over it then we are in a
single network and then catch

470
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:42,139
can catch traffic from the remote
banking service system so therefore

471
00:26:42,139 --> 00:26:46,610
inventory inventory bottom-up is built
in the following way: first you get

472
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:47,700
information about

473
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:54,269
all the assets of the system you

474
00:26:54,269 --> 00:26:57,470
identify all the networking points
Mantri

475
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:01,360
after getting all the information about
them after analyzing

476
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,539
the configuration of the riders and
switches you build it apology network

477
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:06,450
then you understand how the

478
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:09,980
ad network is built into the Lancer lot
how this defied

479
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:14,350
in the presentation and then how the
information flows out be ok and lot

480
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:17,450
how it should be chilled out for the pie
was about how great what's

481
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:21,480
and on the basis of this information you
group a points

482
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,720
present for you have the key information
system

483
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,789
and Bugzilla reservists to it you look
at it as a single

484
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:31,970
point because as a single object on
attack from the hikers point of view

485
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:35,340
and then we take into storage needs if a
close because you have to understand

486
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:40,220
were the protocols are also control are
running around and what the Education

487
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,779
data can be used a privileged users

488
00:27:41,779 --> 00:27:45,429
which as hackable education while doing
it

489
00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:49,139
attack so

490
00:27:49,139 --> 00:27:52,519
what does it mean the inventory all

491
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:57,130
the entry points well you have to
identify them festival you have to

492
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:01,529
identified or so points differently if
you scan let work with and map

493
00:28:01,529 --> 00:28:04,889
you see the network as just settle IP
addresses if you scan it

494
00:28:04,889 --> 00:28:08,240
with a helper for advanced scanner which
can't

495
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,730
analyze considerations the inventory for
us will be calm

496
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:15,419
a set up the software that is installed
on the also computers

497
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:18,549
the settler villages which are available
for penetration

498
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:22,809
in the software configurations network
configuration

499
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:29,060
configuration of the security functions
sir because a

500
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:33,040
del often that we can see ERISA we show
you that hackers and by the way

501
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:38,680
in a pen testing showed every sell them
we use exploited to the battery

502
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:43,280
whether bill it is very of turn a only
misconfiguration works pretty well

503
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:48,320
improperly configured improperly
configured

504
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,860
elements and this is related to the fun
factor users

505
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,840
don't permit to use exploits if
something will not work in this

506
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,460
condition

507
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,720
we have to use exclusively the limit is
a

508
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,130
publications artificial errors and areas
of settings

509
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:07,680
of subcomponents bug therefore after
collecting this information we get

510
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,080
the initial data in order to beale

511
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,160
possible ways of attack against such a
system

512
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,340
separately

513
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:21,150
its ability to pose on the network and
there's a massive tools which can do

514
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:21,710
that

515
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:26,440
for example when a starter to work at
eighteen years ago in these fields

516
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:32,900
I'm using network am manager at which
with SNMP was as Kenny configurations of

517
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,620
their routers

518
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,680
switches workstations desktops and
they've been going to college but was

519
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:36,980
being

520
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:40,560
apology on the network level up the
model senator level

521
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,950
and most of the accessible to all sets
they work in the same way

522
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:47,200
but assisting you should take into
consideration the bus of

523
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,950
equations the same a second channel
level because %uh only the analysis of

524
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:53,540
routing

525
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:56,890
all these bad trance he will not be able
to find them this can be done

526
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:00,000
only by analyzing connection of ports
all the runners

527
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,750
to some be Lance if you'd like to
analyze the whether you're correct to

528
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,890
set up the fire was yesterday
consideration

529
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:11,100
as a liaison their routers and settings
overrule so filtration and the time was

530
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,000
but as a rule is a transportation level

531
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,790
addition to that very often at the use
firewalls and applied level

532
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:20,730
about of and other one so that's all you
have to take into consideration the

533
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:24,920
connectedness and applied level

534
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,250
image into that very often we see the
presence of solutions the

535
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:32,290
when the set data sets are being pulled

536
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:35,980
two different articles for example
control the industrial equipment

537
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:40,800
we have a my boss protocol which works
on the end devices on field devices

538
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:45,090
however ET's been broadcasted as what
bus TCP network

539
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:48,510
the same date has been transferred am
India route and were bussed it is to be

540
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:51,120
a there may be no bullets but if you'll
pull data

541
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,650
after what say you can exploit from
their ability directly

542
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,910
in the a hardware settings

543
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:03,580
when use the systems like for example
photo of state services by and we feel

544
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:07,970
the application/pdf form media
publications been sent to the issue 2p

545
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:08,580
protocol

546
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:11,830
it's been too long to the service ever
extract data from it and send its

547
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:16,590
to the database control system well for
us it's a possible but difficult waves

548
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:19,220
location of SQL Injection is Colin
Jackson isn't

549
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:24,120
injected into PDF web server a will
transfer the Cisco injection after was

550
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,020
extremely

551
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:29,650
difficult to use but I can illustrates
sometimes it is possible

552
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:33,580
but it's not enough to analyze the level
get a chance for but you have to analyze

553
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:38,280
the it's not I'm not to analyze
networking components of getting shots

554
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,670
but you also have to

555
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:44,340
analyze the pathway how the data is
being poured into the processing server

556
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:48,680
and sometimes it's a very difficult way
different pathway different route

557
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:52,830
the most important thing

558
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:57,010
we face it's a misunderstanding of
threats

559
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:00,560
himself so you take the railroad station
actual system

560
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:05,150
those at train control system they are
automated assault the motion is

561
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:09,350
he does a lot of things about he policy
signals which are given to him

562
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:12,930
the by it showing different light upon
the security point to you

563
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:17,030
threat there's a lot of that went about
it the threat of railroad transportation

564
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:20,420
are the same the lesions of a
confidentiality

565
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:23,780
just being bullied shouldn't work like
that because we cannot adequately

566
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,970
redirected a techie we don't then what's
going to result in the setback

567
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:31,300
so that two situations that we can we
have received control

568
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:36,160
over the light I'll and we can give a
sudden light green to red or yellow

569
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,500
which consequences it may lead to a from
the party a classical security

570
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,030
is the a violation of integrity and
there's no difference from anyway

571
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,080
so if you will give

572
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,659
over green light for example the
entrance lighter other stations believe

573
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:51,440
that the A train is on station the
second train

574
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,460
it doesn't stop and there's a a human

575
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:57,860
deaths at center in the same situation
if you will you at Casa kill i

576
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,610
disbelieve

577
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:02,649
to the fact that the second train much
in East will see the signal we'll be

578
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:03,630
able to stop

579
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:07,669
will stall he he will see the tail
lights on the stopping trains will stop

580
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:08,250
on time

581
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:12,019
yes this will blog the it's gonna be
financial

582
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:15,700
transfers to the but it will not lead to
the human a

583
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:19,399
threats and yasser should take in
consideration the context

584
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:23,590
at work these devices like it that which
we were able to break an attack

585
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:27,100
yes in case over the station it will
look this week if you will give green

586
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:27,659
light

587
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:30,909
I'm a light switch are covering

588
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:34,039
blah section over railroads one side

589
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:37,669
relegate may lead to this she said that
two trains will enter the same

590
00:33:37,669 --> 00:33:42,700
block and there will be a important
constraints away the cancer if you will

591
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:42,940
give

592
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:46,659
yellow light board train so we'll goal a
head to head

593
00:33:46,659 --> 00:33:50,740
they will not break but they will block
the railroad without a human

594
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:54,590
deaths from the rail rock love you it's
a much worse for the railroad even

595
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,980
though it's cynical because you have to
be compensation

596
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:01,010
to the who or income arrived on time
well in that case

597
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:04,960
Eve the strains will blow the movement
the movement will stop in the railroad

598
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,359
in the summer billion losses for the
chance to discover from business point

599
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:09,750
of view it's much was down

600
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:12,970
collision trains so in order to be ready

601
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:18,119
to understand how fast we can react to
various attacks you have two problems a

602
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:19,250
standard technology

603
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:22,889
of what he's being defended and what
really happens

604
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:26,359
a in the business system and the

605
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:29,839
you know defending said cannot do it
alone they have up to apply IT guy

606
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,369
technological especially as

607
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:35,379
for sale in the railroad transportation
systems you know I'll

608
00:34:35,379 --> 00:34:38,460
you know charters are written by the
block and they also been written by the

609
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,560
blood there's a certain set of threats
which are defiant in a

610
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,720
legal degradation of those rental
companies are and

611
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:49,050
all the situations which can lead to
human deaths

612
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:52,669
or two the establish all developed a
position that will educate

613
00:34:52,669 --> 00:34:55,210
the same with the Asian transportation
the same way

614
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:59,940
a chemical processes on chemical
factories while processing factories and

615
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,140
a pipelines et cetera et cetera as
strange as it may seem

616
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:06,540
irrespective it in fact that will hike
as Sir

617
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:11,530
and bench SRS even we have to learn
about it when we do

618
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:14,710
the Dez analysis of defense

619
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:18,740
therefore we

620
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:22,970
do know which consequences this attack
may lead to any given case

621
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:28,280
the transfer of the switch under the
train

622
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,870
when it passes to a certain railroad to
and we know that this and that cannot be

623
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,720
done by one single men because the
system is

624
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,030
isolated in order to do this

625
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:40,800
attack one shooed Jason Segel some
actions

626
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,710
so after we have done inventory of the
information she's 10 from which

627
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:47,780
16 can seize which networking segment
somewhat

628
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:51,200
and how it is set up a looking old days
we can bail

629
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,650
graphics of possible attacks yes being
outside

630
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:58,000
we cannot immediately influence

631
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,620
the microprocessor system of controlling
the railroads

632
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:05,380
by the step number one that we can do we
can get

633
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:09,460
access to the working station where all
day dispatch on the station right

634
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:13,990
because his bad guy periodically for 3G
modem into his station in order to play

635
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:14,620
tanks

636
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:20,370
for example are so let's keep with 3G
modem because he has access to the

637
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:21,760
Internet it means he is a

638
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,480
sorry to social engineering into his
organization can download exploit yes

639
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,920
it's going to work a

640
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,750
there's not going to be causal
connection it's going to work at be ok

641
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,090
but it's enough to detect

642
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:35,310
if we can't download the explode at his
work station

643
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:38,810
it means that we can try to do arc
spoofing attacks

644
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:41,860
or Eve we see it dad on the

645
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:45,940
a spanning tree protocol is not been
feel that we can reroute the

646
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:49,670
property inside on the network and we
can catch traffic for example

647
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:52,930
shop feat care of the FTP protocol to we
cheer

648
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:54,640
they come to Ky

649
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,750
Monday system is being controlled

650
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:01,140
if we can get access to the FTP protocol

651
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:04,600
them to put are own a hard work software

652
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,640
we see here

653
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:12,200
the guys who work in the railroad jerk
or related to the set system will find

654
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:12,670
the

655
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:16,290
binder analyses then we customize the
software

656
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:22,170
down it does what we should do each step
like this and stem love for us because

657
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:24,210
the source for it eighties

658
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:27,370
our knowledge about how the component is
billed

659
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,890
our launch a typical heiress that are
done on this component

660
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:34,420
an on knowledge about typical ways of
using these and exploiting this

661
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:38,650
air so we can more or a possible Russell
their tech by building this graph

662
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:43,790
simply by collecting and are rising
information from the informational

663
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:46,880
system so

664
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:53,330
people into a great Eve for

665
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:58,190
if you wanna be ready to react against
the attacks we should have a sudden

666
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:05,270
tools available so we need the inventory
the inventory in the network is done

667
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:12,460
the

668
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:16,040
in the glory is done by civil scanners
for some

669
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,100
much petrol by using the prodigal
controlling

670
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:23,279
equipment WM rifle tweet us

671
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,090
SSH Telnet for network equipment
etcetera its able to collect information

672
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:28,630
about the abilities

673
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:31,950
about air configuration software
installed et cetera et cetera but that

674
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,480
was the idea of the best shows I've

675
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,020
out to mating the inventors Asian on the
network

676
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:40,870
came to us along the way while we were
developing

677
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:46,000
him %uh special scanner therefore
putting and

678
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,290
against the network putting the scanner
against network we can collect

679
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:53,150
love information that we need to

680
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:57,520
to build a graph attacks and to
understand

681
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,810
how the system is built and what when
protected from

682
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:03,990
therefore

683
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:07,620
in order to discover attacks yes

684
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:11,180
there's a system of describing the
attacks and possibly can divide into two

685
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:11,900
classes

686
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:15,520
it's based on C which was in base and is
coming to an on the spot on them

687
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,970
have their advantages it was unconscious
and system

688
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:23,210
the system is based on signature as a it
works against well known exploits

689
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:29,110
but that they don't work they don't work
again sunglasses attack so we've also

690
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,870
had a situation when a client

691
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:34,100
so did the pen testing and the clutter
that all the time

692
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:37,890
security as we're looking up yes locks

693
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:41,700
so very good

694
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:45,800
ideas manufactures they didn't know how
to pick a rich outspoken attacks well

695
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,180
these

696
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:49,850
signatures what you find them but they
just didn't give these the

697
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:52,960
warning switch dealers why but
applications left

698
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,740
to the manufacturer but it was a
reaction the systems of course

699
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:01,540
have a lot botsford text which

700
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:06,040
have no other seem that surest

701
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:10,350
to wish you can know this attack but has
been done this is not just coming and

702
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:11,480
%ah listen

703
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,820
other way able to find attends just
because

704
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:20,000
the take a little bit different from
regular traffic flow between

705
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,210
different non-citizens but is not a
problem is approx positives

706
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:28,460
every false positive every files

707
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:32,850
warning about an attack its labor force
the more labor force you spend

708
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:38,060
labor which doesn't give a visual result

709
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:42,240
its on hedonism the business because we
need people they need to be sellers to

710
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,960
those people

711
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,930
and it did

712
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:48,970
than just sits and looks up false
positives why do we need this person

713
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:52,540
so love these means all the detection
offer

714
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:56,809
injections will not give you 100 percent
protection for their tax

715
00:40:56,809 --> 00:41:00,440
however if you will bring together

716
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,059
ideas but we the inventory system

717
00:41:04,059 --> 00:41:09,349
you can find a lot of interesting things
why because in the dry season from them

718
00:41:09,349 --> 00:41:12,730
you know but for their abilities which
relapse resident given them time

719
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:16,040
it is in four seasons and for this on
their abilities as it is well known

720
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,540
we know there's a and way a.m. said

721
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:22,849
of well-known way so using this on their
abilities whatever

722
00:41:22,849 --> 00:41:26,829
this set of dole's which can be used as
for nobility is

723
00:41:26,829 --> 00:41:31,130
obligation up each one of these tools in
each of these vulnerabilities gives us

724
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:36,660
well known typical the food trains that
you can discover in the network traffic

725
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:40,750
therefore analysis of the network
traffic if you don't have an objective

726
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:46,190
of searching for seed certain signatures
you can make it in just search

727
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:50,140
of for trains of bell on attacks saw it
we have

728
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:54,020
a2 data sources which you can compare
want another

729
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:58,280
addition to that the are logs the which
give you a lot of usual

730
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:02,339
and good information for example the
same IDS is daycare

731
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:06,869
discover at password brute forcing for
one connection you have a

732
00:42:06,869 --> 00:42:10,990
big number offer branch out into gation

733
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:13,990
attacks well this is out simple brute
force and brute forcing

734
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:18,250
doesn't is not done this way to talk
occasionally ideas and for example

735
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:23,079
those rare technique of a temporary
blocking of the account

736
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:26,089
well we have we know

737
00:42:26,089 --> 00:42:29,589
212 de Council the users on the system
and we know that

738
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:32,690
after three attempts of us what City

739
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:37,940
your account will be blocked for twenty
or thirty minutes we do know that the

740
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,150
circle tire

741
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:42,569
after two II attempts willoughby

742
00:42:42,569 --> 00:42:45,270
dropped after 20 min something the
teacher and there was a bus what

743
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:45,970
technique

744
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:51,059
when you make two attempts to are not
successful then you go to that next a

745
00:42:51,059 --> 00:42:51,720
computer

746
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:55,859
you take the least a also most common
passwords are you take to

747
00:42:55,859 --> 00:42:59,380
bus was you take then you wait 20
minutes before the counter

748
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:04,029
been 0 then you test until next bus was
the sway gives you a possibility

749
00:43:04,029 --> 00:43:07,170
or getting three percent abuses which
use

750
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:11,269
what passwords what base bus was an
thanks to clouds

751
00:43:11,269 --> 00:43:16,700
thanks to Amazon thanks to resistant
systems we can

752
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:22,630
RAM certain a nombre of machines in the
cloud which happily different IP address

753
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:24,470
is entirely different job location:

754
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:28,299
I'm the speed about both nets which are
applied for the special purpose

755
00:43:28,299 --> 00:43:31,569
and this attacks will not be coming from
certain but he'll appoint

756
00:43:31,569 --> 00:43:35,539
so there's no signature which would
allow the network ideas on the network

757
00:43:35,539 --> 00:43:37,069
and the related to identify this attack

758
00:43:37,069 --> 00:43:40,119
as a brute forcing attacked but this
information will

759
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:43,150
the be seen by laws in the service and
applications

760
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:49,460
therefore network

761
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:53,250
analyzer so will be added to the local
agencies and so we have three

762
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:56,380
their sources of data wish others

763
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:59,880
to analyze these attacks from three
different factors

764
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,930
so in order to

765
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:05,960
compare I love these you can use

766
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,630
systems cm even correlation systems

767
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:13,220
to end this addition ceases and one the
ability is limited

768
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:16,799
integration yes they can work with
scanners available to get that

769
00:44:16,799 --> 00:44:20,650
can underlies lock yes they can work
with

770
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:23,930
they can allies traffic

771
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:27,140
but it problem is dead did in fact that
these systems

772
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:32,859
are developed by different manufacturers
they use different formats of messages

773
00:44:32,859 --> 00:44:36,220
different data composition and
developers of CAAM

774
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:39,349
have different limited a capabilities
from the point of view

775
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:43,049
alva integration cells so it she a.m.
can

776
00:44:43,049 --> 00:44:46,470
decompile and parse the message for all
mmm

777
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:50,490
which is coming from ideas for example

778
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:54,230
but not all these data which is present
their can be used for the used

779
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:57,500
for some the experience of my spatula
with us

780
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:01,799
with ArcSight outside takes information
from well known for their abilities and

781
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:03,950
he cannot do anything else with it but

782
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:07,869
she was being in exile document that we
give to them there's a massive

783
00:45:07,869 --> 00:45:11,690
other interesting things the does a
software there's information what

784
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:12,920
settings et cetera

785
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:18,450
budget by that oxide integration part
way the analysis on abilities is set up

786
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:19,280
for

787
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,420
let's see average

788
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:26,420
possibilities on the scanner this
information is not being taken because

789
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:27,910
they are not going to set up

790
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:30,940
for the additional purposes another
solution other on

791
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:35,210
so the we need to have a camo which
can't marshal it for the

792
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:38,740
work with all available information
which customer all these sources

793
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:42,990
the second problem over as I am is that
a coalition advances Don

794
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:46,490
in a universal waste

795
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:50,220
roughly speaking we calculate the number
of events on a certain type a

796
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:54,400
when we exceed a certain threshold we
see the trigger

797
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:59,670
watching well we have it incident wave
toria an apprentice live in showing you

798
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:01,920
that we can be healed

799
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,330
we can bail attacked grab so we have the

800
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:09,830
and settled for the liabilities and the
ways how this will notice can be is

801
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:13,890
and that traces which left after this
affects he we would have got to be some

802
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:14,520
knowledge

803
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,770
which rules contain and compare all of
these

804
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:21,800
Venice CA and could use correlations a
basam

805
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:25,850
attacks attack types Gary

806
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:30,360
often sequential activities on the
hackers are not perceived as a single

807
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,950
set of activities and that we had a

808
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:35,590
broadcasting the possible but in this
case we had exploiting

809
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:39,090
all the local in Irvine CA those nor
sign which cool

810
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:42,510
a priori defined the rules of
commissions which would look at to

811
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:47,160
these actions as a 20 steps on the same
channel attack

812
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:51,750
if we do have graphic attacked we know
that after brute forcing the password

813
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:56,600
possibly would could have five actions
attacks and a local exploit is a

814
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:00,950
step before let's say so we can on the
basis of these a basic knowledge we can

815
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:01,610
connect

816
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:05,400
to all these different events in to
achieve attack and we do know where this

817
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,290
attack have started to study from the
book pricing on the bus which

818
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:11,720
we'll head was getting it was canteen by
exploiting local nobility

819
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:14,740
and we know which possibilities hike has

820
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:18,290
receipt he began local admin on the
computer and therefore

821
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:22,230
he said attacks he's pictures of an ex
are extended

822
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:25,029
by this number by edging this this and
this

823
00:47:25,029 --> 00:47:30,289
attacks this gives us a possibility to
automatically include additional

824
00:47:30,289 --> 00:47:31,189
circulation

825
00:47:31,189 --> 00:47:36,499
and filo wish other signs of the
developer that act we can find in our

826
00:47:36,499 --> 00:47:36,969
network

827
00:47:36,969 --> 00:47:40,799
afterwards death for these

828
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:46,469
baseball H on the results of that test
we are developing and we can build

829
00:47:46,469 --> 00:47:50,499
into the product that we propose

830
00:47:50,499 --> 00:48:00,109
to our clients we do the correlation
events and it

831
00:48:00,109 --> 00:48:05,150
allows in this Oct allows us to identify
attacks against information system as a

832
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:05,779
result

833
00:48:05,779 --> 00:48:10,199
but do we have as a result about this
right now this is a prototype which

834
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:11,449
works a

835
00:48:11,449 --> 00:48:14,539
our bases in which or to their clothes
is a unified up

836
00:48:14,539 --> 00:48:18,169
system on a single platform which eat it
to just seven

837
00:48:18,169 --> 00:48:27,619
this scanner DPI correlation above
answer the

838
00:48:27,619 --> 00:48:31,549
product and bass %uh large open their
abilities lectures on attacks

839
00:48:31,549 --> 00:48:35,849
the how curse tools et cetera face to
all these are being

840
00:48:35,849 --> 00:48:38,979
united into one platform yes you cannot
defend yourself from

841
00:48:38,979 --> 00:48:41,519
everything but you can depend from
yourself from the things which are

842
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:41,979
well-known

843
00:48:41,979 --> 00:48:45,449
and a database is being updated
constantly and by doing these

844
00:48:45,449 --> 00:48:49,799
we freed operators of the system from
made a low-level corning

845
00:48:49,799 --> 00:48:54,650
all the rules of correlation so well all

846
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:57,869
way are using the abilities is been
automatically becomes

847
00:48:57,869 --> 00:49:00,939
into certain dodi's of correlations

848
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:06,759
the how to discard the two different
data sources the traces of the saudis

849
00:49:06,759 --> 00:49:11,689
for that attack speculation therefore

850
00:49:11,689 --> 00:49:18,650
J

851
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:22,510
title for me next statement

852
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:28,119
yes therefore did just like that upon
the results of this inventory we know

853
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:28,549
not

854
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:32,010
on the door sir boys by the topology
other network including the

855
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,079
connectedness

856
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:37,180
and applied at all know Wayne that
hacker right now has done an attack

857
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,849
against this particular point of entry

858
00:49:38,849 --> 00:49:43,030
we don't stand which other points of
become available to him after this but

859
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:43,730
your point

860
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:48,559
after seeing the attack against the
demilitarized zone

861
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:52,390
the point that we can immediately warned
the administrators

862
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:56,460
the database a manager's we should get
in the NHL Network

863
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,520
which is not accessible to the agar but
we know that those connections and the

864
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,710
data transfer and the possibility of
exploiting

865
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:05,770
the same SQL injections and therefore

866
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:10,359
the should you should open your eyes and
see it may be something strange happens

867
00:50:10,359 --> 00:50:11,160
to your cell because

868
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:14,260
right now you will be attacked because I
right now there was a successful scan

869
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:14,890
NBC

870
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:18,280
download on the web shell to the web
server which works with

871
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:24,240
your database with your

872
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,490
DBMS and it helps us to build the
coalitions and extending

873
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:30,490
attack in the process ok its rendition
at its

874
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:37,359
early stages therefore in a result we
get a single platform

875
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:40,859
on the basis on which we be ill system

876
00:50:40,859 --> 00:50:44,000
we called secret operations center

877
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,250
associate structural subdivision we
cheer follows

878
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:53,039
but what will happen the Purina the
company-wide a really have a chance at a

879
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:56,039
networking event they discovered traces
attacks and then

880
00:50:56,039 --> 00:51:00,289
makes decisions other bases all the
special information so we get it

881
00:51:00,289 --> 00:51:04,529
coordinator inside company so if
previously Security Department I was

882
00:51:04,529 --> 00:51:06,339
writing papers

883
00:51:06,339 --> 00:51:10,390
was following that means with proper
liquidate function security

884
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:13,990
this is all set allows you to make

885
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:18,740
and creating side of your security
department a subdivision which will be

886
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:19,520
responsible

887
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,740
it's some kinda warning group you have
discovered a hacker attack

888
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:26,539
at the moment when haggard just have
found the first from the religion first

889
00:51:26,539 --> 00:51:28,640
entry point and try to use it

890
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,970
and just over its

891
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:33,190
helps you to remove the problem of luck
offer

892
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:36,869
professionals have somebody come if you
look at some ministry in essential

893
00:51:36,869 --> 00:51:39,359
office of this ministry it's a big
problem

894
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:43,559
to create the department which would
have well qualified specialists able to

895
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:44,490
discover the surtax

896
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:50,839
some were in remote in a bold CD and
where the population of 20,000 people

897
00:51:50,839 --> 00:51:54,880
and they have a tutorial a division of
this ministry qualified specialists well

898
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:55,960
it's impossible to find them

899
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:59,210
by creating such a division which is a
centralized bases

900
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:02,890
money towards the whole infrastructure
we basically came from a single point

901
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:06,670
we can lodge and discover that text but
we can help people in

902
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:11,270
locations in the implications if we know
that hackers and the someone with time

903
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:14,859
this effort to look in saint petersburg
attacks systems which is located

904
00:52:14,859 --> 00:52:21,000
in Loxley ask we can largess inform them
about this attack but we also know

905
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,220
what kind of attack is happening and we
also know what is to be done in

906
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:28,300
wanted to prevent and stop it we can get
in touch with respect to people in the

907
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:29,200
because the FCT

908
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:33,550
and we can inform them hey guys can you
block this particular port re

909
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:36,910
says it does mistake all the
configuration this component replace

910
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:38,339
this parameter but this parameter

911
00:52:38,339 --> 00:52:42,000
this will allow us to quickly neutralize
attacks idea of course it's

912
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
understandable that it has to be

913
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,890
the organization structure has to be a
defined for this and for become his hair

914
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:49,140
perm it. but not less

915
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:53,650
for the telecom operators at the Sentosa
reaction centers already been created

916
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:59,650
and work very effectively and by the way
not only in Russia but also their

917
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:00,760
divisions in
