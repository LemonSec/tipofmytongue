where the last several years and by the
way all this presentation is

19
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,700
who are publicly available yes a furious
see can easily downloadable

20
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,130
was that which which don't know

whatever newsstands toll it takes on
eighty years

23
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,080
until the mall short and believe me the
lineups

24
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,090
please spare skill I've sources said not
a single origin

25
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,460
micro only at Mario's say

26
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,460
Russia is among the leaders calling you

27
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,810
absolutely persistence and popularity of

28
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,980
let your little liars or simple
explanation alone

29
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,870
is precious thing in aids all long way

30
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,830
in terms of payment services he said of
plastic cars

31
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:06,820
that so popular in other countries
russians tend to use

32
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,880
for me transfers

33
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,320
settling in terminals old and elsewhere

34
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,390
ask soul according to test their skill

35
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,370
security requires all russian czars

36
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,460
the world leaders yes far is his

37
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:31,870
debts taxes concert all

38
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,310
as you Hill

39
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,370
or just still that potentially

40
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:44,020
dangerous elsewhere malware is like

41
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,550
three times more prevalent in Russia

42
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,610
on the average loving Google says it all
50 is

43
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:56,650
very well protected the only problem is
that used to be much nobody runs Android

44
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,440
like 10 people well again we have

45
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,550
every miserable star search show

46
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,030
you people actually update the operating
systems and mobile devices

47
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:12,050
here earlier sis

48
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:18,019
or other operating systems things on all
their only

49
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:19,870
well first well

50
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,500
aunt I S I known as prevalent as enjoy
it

51
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,459
however they are growing in popularity
more and more devices

52
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:30,480
style featuring a similar viruses will

53
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,390
hit the market and surprisingly a
Windows school seems to be

54
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,569
the best protect system or at least the
least vulnerable

55
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:43,989
at least given their popularity and that
much about 3 percent very few hecklers

56
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:44,510
action

57
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:49,760
care to attack it in the first place
also please note

58
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,769
its I S Plus

59
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:56,109
initially expected to be better
protected

60
00:03:56,109 --> 00:03:59,940
because he could only download new
applications

61
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,970
from layoffs or indirectly but they'll

62
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,920
and as we all know this Mitchell
particular feature was a

63
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,590
easily circumvented and I think that's
in this respect with this phone is very

64
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,569
much like Kleenex

65
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:16,329
or the elusive Joe this is a pretty
well-known joke in Russian

66
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:20,430
though the elusive Joel nobody can catch
because nobody gives a damn about

67
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:26,710
good but you probably remember that

68
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:31,070
all I US users are more than welcome to
jailbreak their devices

69
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,949
the moment lied to that's they become
labeled

70
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:39,190
download in fancy applications from not
so legal app stores

71
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,430
and this could be that actual attack

72
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,039
in fact we know of cases when long jail
broke and

73
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:49,820
devices were indeed sir infects

74
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,949
some vulnerabilities for example where
followed in the certificates

75
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:57,230
some cases for example

76
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:01,910
good people words followed

77
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,940
fishing Beijing emails

78
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,000
and then

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,590
some application would invite him to
updates

80
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,670
itself say let's press the Yes button

81
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:18,580
thinking funny most secure system in the
whole world

82
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,030
now I'll thing about say words
potentially

83
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,790
until you told me their protective
software

84
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:30,150
up you know you might remember it was a
time when no

85
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,650
Kentucky clean state south of all the
legal music

86
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:38,070
and that was the time line lots of fancy
application service and Kentucky

87
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,750
promising access to free music and most
other

88
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:45,260
featured Trojans back door so what have
you

89
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,340
well I think I want a

90
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,590
well able to spend money on research on
our ability is

91
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:55,350

research with Daytona

92
00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:03,110
trot obviously my lawyer in most cases
it is launched

93
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:08,130

different ways to monetize

94

that way it's a very easy here to use
for

108
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,909
the double verification system

109
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:04,159
there are also other types of girls

two or three thousand euros which is

115
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,050
like whose there'll also other types of

he bynoe most players

129
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:25,390
viruses are socially full-fledged
baldness clients they collect statistics

130
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:28,530
they can all sorts of commands and

131
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:33,140
in most cases they will leave for a long
period of time on the mobile device

132
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,750
in fact the help

133
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,590
developed a number features that make it
very compatible to the Big Brothers

134
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:44,570
running on desktops and this means that
in order to fight only need to be

00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,270
security professionals from the other
side of the fence speak

163
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:43,540
he's

164
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,980
though the control site

165
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,530
when needs to take into account and this
on mobile devices

166
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:54,150
University special up

167
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:59,140
for traditional alt as he will need calc
use horse IP addresses

168
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,470
your boats orwell talk to them owner

169
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,450
regular on a regular basis we will also
try teens

170
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,550
fayed your defense's

171
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,880
by using all saying double flexing

172
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,940
and changing IP static going all

173
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,250
up interestingly almost so those things

174
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:24,410
are invading the mall while down now

175
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:28,260
he can I will discover which particular

176
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,270
phone number spreading the infection you
can blow kids

177
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:38,510
the headless body thats him any boat
that's

178
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,750
operate like this play well and in fact
it's

179
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,530
I'll exit mobile phone will executing
commands

180
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:50,310
whichever phone comes from as long as a
it's a political structure

181
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:54,530
who love Google

182
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:58,960
am please now most something he is
Google Cloud messaging to push service

183
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,650
from Google

184
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:04,320
in order to proper tools and in order to
issue commands

185
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,700
all and there is nothing suspicious
about

186
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,670
try to guess he you get jury usual
messages like that

187
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:16,000
I'll quite of innis the standard to

188
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,940
Google Cloud Service that issue commands
for the vault

189
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,220
all you need to do is just register an
account to you get here I T

190
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,360
cool they have been cases when

191
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,060
up ID's like that where's to will and
then Google would react

192
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:36,870
block happen secular account but its
report on to remember that circle will

193
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,820
it solve the real

194
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,400
lost all Foley elites

195
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:46,980
you will take them time to close to does
this covers the kind of data we can

196
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,880
collect

197
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,590
in order to contra counter this threat

198
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:55,230
obviously we need the IP's domain names

199
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:58,440
scene sees as well as

200
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,339
the addresses of the sites property in
the mail

201
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:07,360
will also need to learn more about the
format

202
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,700
and the composition of the commands
issued by the command and control

203
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,690
centers

204
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:18,260
horse also care about the type of tax
aids

205
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:22,220
but also useful is phone numbers

206
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,830
because quite often

207
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:29,660
the same phone numbers will be years in
order to extract

208
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:35,720
money from the mall accounts and in some
cases

209
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,860
when dealing with head it's not headless
sport thats

210
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:45,899
you can also point the phone numbers on
the hills

211
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:50,080
subscription ID is well this is
something up close all to rate Reza a

212
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:55,610
lower killing this sector also

213
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:59,720
who'll

214
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,950
night it's difficult for you to follow
this anti-fraud discussion lemme

215
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:08,630
me several explanations all the

216
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:12,649
C&C yes hoster issues came out so

217
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:15,850
and then we are talking about so collect
certain numbers

218
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,360
and this essentially at the advice

219
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,420
that collects information about

220
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,630
your account balance for example
services

221
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:29,089
you're subscribed to linsell and finally

222
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:32,510
there I'll cash accumulators so this
could be

223
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:36,899
counts for polling numbers that
accumulates all the defrauded

224
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:39,940
money for future transfers

225
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:47,360
all withdrawals now we are going to also
talking about and tight

226
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,459
bugging titles and techniques there's a
reason for that

227
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:56,170
we have very simple statement to make
sold

228
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,159
all the malware

229
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,069
hope place all the malware

230
00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:04,319
for mobile devices uses

231
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:07,799
I'm at a an IMSI controls

232
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:13,649
here me said he can launch ever

233
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:17,009
eighty once up couple

234
00:15:17,009 --> 00:15:21,489
oh and will run once Bible and the
second cycle

235
00:15:21,489 --> 00:15:24,949
who just or

236
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:29,709
who up and a particular device can be

237
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:33,679
can be blacklisted its for some time
forever

238
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:38,299
go yes all was Jill occasional nestle

239
00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:42,189
will work together in different ways
triangulation to the Y

240
00:15:42,189 --> 00:15:48,879
are a GPS could be assisted GPS of cheap

241
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:53,169
this essentially means thats Hugh
Campbell also the activities of the

242
00:15:53,169 --> 00:15:53,819
malware

243
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:58,439
in particular that works its GSM address
a WiFi networks

244
00:15:58,439 --> 00:16:01,489
we actually soul well aware that would
not work

245
00:16:01,489 --> 00:16:06,649
in the MTS office can you believe it or
not lol also so malware and that would

246
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:08,129
not work in moscow

247
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:11,699
like he had Moscow blocked out from its

248
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:14,879
the every other geographical
applicability know we'll see

249
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:19,039
found well aware that would not work
after 8 p.m.

250
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:22,879
people but we are talking full-fledged
software so

251
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:27,839
his should be easily configurable Hugo

252
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,049
you am moreover yep

253
00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:35,599
the guys on the other side lights Carson
for example

254
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:39,449
they will be delaying their operations

255
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:42,609
well say ok it's only 24 hours

256
00:16:42,609 --> 00:16:46,289
I'm not reinstall something a little
spring into action

257
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:49,629
he will never mobilier whenever defraud

258
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:52,970
or for relatives

259
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,079
figures so to speak police complex
sounds

260
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,649
start ok now utilize

261
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:02,779
is already in running malware

262
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:05,059
and say it does crips or

263
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:09,009
thing Houston if you try to delay it
says its worldwide

264
00:17:09,009 --> 00:17:13,029
a device for example

265
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:17,069
analysts I also maximum

266
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,120
priority to the particular

267
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,569
application has been Walt

268
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:27,709
and that's something we've seen a number
of times and we know that actually

269
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:30,779
makes the dogging process much more
difficult so

270
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:35,639
hook think that spassky

271
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:39,309
I'll cover this study here we go very

272
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:43,759
of only also admiral explores very often
they are based on

273
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:49,639
simple media attack routines and we have
seen

274
00:17:49,639 --> 00:17:54,190
all several very simple exploits basil
that like

275
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:57,990
press this button to get 10 crystal so
this is how you get a

276
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:01,179
girls exploited builtin

277
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:04,860
also little and Jerry of any

278
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:11,619
yet malicious AP k so will not be
discovered by any AV system here running

279
00:18:11,619 --> 00:18:14,749
than together the combined he's

280
00:18:14,749 --> 00:18:18,029
welcome lol thats alt

281
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:23,059
knowledge system from within who no was
probably most difficult in the emulator

282
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:24,169
East each

283
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:27,999
back the connected services part

284
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:32,480
to the malware for example can be our
senior SMS from payment service

285
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,570
and your bank check on whether you have
a particular stress

286
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:40,419
install alt and non

287
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,970
whenever is connected will thing all the
popular services dispatched to check

288
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:46,710
whether you have an account with them
when they have an imbalance with them

289
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:51,970
I'll

290
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:56,289
school

291
00:18:56,289 --> 00:18:58,740
science and now analysts

292
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,289
sometimes key can be confused but also
because

293
00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:08,299
say this service mind century and now
some ass back saying no you don't have

294
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:09,299
an account with us

295
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:13,100
but a ago lol well to late its the
Eagles

296
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,279
supplies which is disregard messages
like this

297
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:20,980
even if the ultimate well

298
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,779
will

299
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:29,580
now imagine he he believes something is
wrong and what

300
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:34,159
money a space stolen from your account
loop

301
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:37,710
of all

302
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:43,020
who and the malware

303
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:47,620
for example was walk

304
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,000
can tweak all the tech support numbers

305
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,720
so if you are trying to access the
helpdesk of your particular carrier

306
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,909
your calls a lot culture your

307
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:03,100
well you naturally to 4.4 all its

308
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,870
much more difficult since Hill delete
SMS from the law

309
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:10,450
you still can't do anything about it
leasing ending with SLE

310
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:14,830
phone like you will see the sham honeys
evaporating into thin air

311
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:21,220
a you count all your operator hood

312
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,350
or quite often malware a little delay
says

313
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:29,410
all is full-fledged framework he has a

314
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:32,690
web interface for plays generation with
those

315
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,740
random pages ran to my concern he also
had a

316
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:39,170
statistics are so what they gonna stay
is worse

317
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:42,680
first danger will be sent in plane taxed

318
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,730
say you would see like hedge intercepted
the masses she'll see I'm

319
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:49,820
I'm aside balance well and played it was

320
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,680
agent intercell that only had it a 64
encryption

321
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,190
and Ali at is a 64 with morning fly
Delta

322
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:01,380
cool I'll so think quite get it without
saying

323
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:07,940
well

324
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:12,230
you and interestingly they we've been
able to develop

325
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:16,420
at a particular level both which exploit
our

326
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,990
enable them to bypass Kaspersky

327
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:23,250
allow anti-virus it'll

328
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,920
I'm sorry I was not actually I was class
you see what kinda

329
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,520
fancy name they came up for that
particular class hot cold cave

330
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,580
occur with Kaskaskia toddlers

331
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,990
obviously or so base in all the states
elysa

332
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:40,310
weekly yet in anti-fraud

333
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:43,480
virtualization debugging

334
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,570
fire drills are aware any other

335
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,770
interface of mobile email laters

336
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:54,480
makes no sense lemme my point

337
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,970
%uh expert now so the Colts and behavior
in else has seen the emulation

338
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:04,030
dunno give you the all the extent of the
day TN 8

339
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:11,000
in so many layers for example

340
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,020
this earlier application can roll for a
limited period of time she will be able

341
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,830
to collect all the information you need
about its activities

342
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,059
for example EE candor launch

343
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:25,970
several hours later and hosts the claim
and later we'll wait

344
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:31,410
until then rate like dennis has already
mentioned

345
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:38,410
up

346
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:41,480
the application can see for example is
being well

347
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,580
in an emulator so we'll just stay
dormant up

348
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:50,380
in order to finance such malware through
emulators

349
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:55,010
he'll need to keep upgrading your
emulators and please remember that

350
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:58,179
fighters designers speak

351
00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:01,480
finds me in their ways you
counterattacks

352
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,919
up well you can also

353
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:08,630
recompile the application and look at
the source code but that might take

354
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:11,700
a lot of time please know that

355
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,049
more than viruses are all of this case
itself he can

356
00:23:15,049 --> 00:23:24,049
all those who precious little time

357
00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:26,410
so we obviously need faster texture

358
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:32,840
culture I could digging through the code
is a lot of fun

359
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,200
this something I should be done by
somebody else whose

360
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,570
this is something but I want to do while
our

361
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,730
ambition is different we have to close
down all

362
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:47,350
next year site for the hackers as soon
as we can

363
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:50,510
in the emulation we discover like
fifty-year

364
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:55,160
host name so we could cover answering
cuz 'cause they'll and in virtualization

365
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,100
the analyst will only find ten

366
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,559
and I kiss you noticed any the margin of
error that's okay

367
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:07,650
here said

368
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:12,919
the first launch of that Firestone us he
only had a single C&C host

369
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:15,980
our show is started the cold we found

370
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,260
12 or 15 more hosts on it

371
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,600
does on our bench in a single day held

372
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:29,110
53 he's

373
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:33,429
used only needs

374
00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:36,910
reverse engineers we need programmers to

375
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:40,740
release or skulls who'll

376
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,840
you all the interests of us I'll
celebration

377
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,740
very different we only need like two
analysts in a single

378
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,780
program a single software developer to

379
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:56,100
up kill this monetize a shiner scenes

380
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:01,000
well this is our architecture by the EC
the stretcher bar sandbox right

381
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,120
and we have this bench was diapers
mobile devices running

382
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,840
different operating systems

383
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,360
we're trying to have a representative

384
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,370
selection device is the most popular
devices in the market

385
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:21,860
with the the most vulnerable

386
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:32,530
always versions and then we use
analyzers to see how different malware

387
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,320
winter

388
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:37,940
behave on all iOS devices and then our
analysts will

389
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:41,240
talk to that analyzer through a
particular web interface

390
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,700
yes good should

391
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,140
you want just really

392
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:51,740
matters details which databases he is

393
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:55,480
which hit the ceiling is she using it

394
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,590
people stress scale me

395
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:02,050
by sana whatever or who'll

396
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:05,280
other again for this

397
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:09,440
analyzer you need the traditional and
roll into

398
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,670
frameworks same issue only using an
unguarded

399
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:16,420
for max which so lease are standards

400
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:20,100
developer kits nothing really
mindboggling

401
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:28,330
nothing special no rocket science show
here is the latest

402
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:32,630
analisa work so you see that tracks the
activity of all the applications on your

403
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:33,490
mobile.phone

404
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:37,230
it analyzes this behavior and and
collect statistics

405
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:46,720
an early annals will work with all the
stats

406
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,740
will discover

407
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,240
infected host names scene sees

408
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,580
and the other information can be useful
further analysis is

409
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:59,320
yep only and all sign that this

410
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:04,179
project could replace your standard
analyzers a real time analyzer is your

411
00:27:04,179 --> 00:27:05,620
anti-fraud rules

412
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:09,630
this is like and additionally
interesting exercise such can

413
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:12,809
improved your security standards

414
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:16,860
I will tell you later how you can easily
built it into your routines

415
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:20,630
show here central

416
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:24,640
mobile to my screenshots so several

417
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,330
applications that are considered to be
militias were analyzed here

418
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:33,280
one is called ever miss also up

419
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:39,250
well ESA usually and download it's a
very simple matter if you wanna check

420
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,289
how's my juicy phat ass

421
00:27:41,289 --> 00:27:46,409
please follow this link: up

422
00:27:46,409 --> 00:27:51,350
NEC nothing if you're not running an
Android device

423
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:54,870
if you say approach and so buying your

424
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:58,270
computer up

425
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:02,360
well nonessential you install the
application give it all the rides

426
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,270
event details up well I'm sorry

427
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:10,860
and there was a mistake you have to do
it but obviously not

428
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:16,360
yes against militants all in our test
this application a lay dormant for about

429
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,669
an hour and a half to that is so working

430
00:28:18,669 --> 00:28:22,919
and this tells me nuts a program you
later called

431
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:27,100
discovering and I'll I wouldn't you want
to talk to the C&C

432
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:31,240
and will trust her some technical
information about

433
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,220
take place and the user and awaited
further instructions

434
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:40,289
but you see over there is the

435
00:28:40,289 --> 00:28:43,299
subscriber I D E this is the

436
00:28:43,299 --> 00:28:47,100
seller operator I T in any case

437
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,450
all this is fake data and Astros souls

438
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,230
he wouldn't be able to exploit this

439
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:57,600
macias up

440
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,350
one analyst doesn't really have to look
too much into some speakers all the same

441
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:01,910
all the

442
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:07,490
relevant information is displayed in his
dashboard say you'll see that there is

443
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:07,970
some

444
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:11,360
suspicious activity coming from a
particular phone

445
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,410
that's a must fall to applications

446
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:18,990
talking to somewhere domain and another
example we're showing here

447
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:26,200
will tell you more about it later

448
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:31,000
up so the animals will see this activity
am

449
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,590
will study in more detail will see for
example request was sent to the C&C

450
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:39,470
your eternity gotta

451
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:43,140
come out we were lucky that this was a
plain-text comment

452
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:48,660
so this plain text amounts s send an SMS
was such a such taxes such-and-such

453
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,450
number

454
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:54,270
up play usually this is

455
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:59,350
well the years the children's rights

456
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:04,440
all the incoming

457
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,650
SMS's are deleted so 8

458
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:12,990
a user will not even know some happens

459
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:21,600
well until he checks his account
statement obviously

460
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,980
also no will talk about dynamic host
names

461
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:29,350
this is in fact a very interesting case
slick

462
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:33,390
children SMS ordered again Elaine
torments

463
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:36,430
assaults on interestingly

464
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:39,830
it off and masquerades as one of the
leading

465
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:42,860
a the applications which is ironic right

466
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:46,290
and this stuff just stay snare in the
Triad

467
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:50,460
very often and it's doesn't have a show
its I can only supplications

468
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:54,730
in some other cases the Caliph largest
itself some

469
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:57,870
popular services adults video games

470
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:05,070
so what you see here

471
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:09,840
is thats the first time in launch we
were able to identify a single host name

472
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,660
it tried talking to him as weak

473
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:17,910
analyze the Colt and it took us quite
some time because it was enough for

474
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:22,120
skater application so as we analyze with
only 12 more hostnames

475
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:26,950
but that was senatorial out and they
discover the full range ally

476
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:33,230
pays at a staggering 53 show series

477
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:37,350
the algorithm we use in order to
identify

478
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:40,390
a suspicious application as a malware

479
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:45,740
in our sandbox let me tell you the rest
of the story dollar to children SMS

480
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,370
borders

481
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:49,680
brown sunny here in time

482
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:53,060
this application

483
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:56,850
actually connected still have premium
service on the Internet

484
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:02,060
and the

485
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:06,120
pretended to be interested in getting a
subscription

486
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,280
horror movies or books I don't remember
say he was

487
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:14,300
redirected to the landing page of the
cell operator

488
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:19,110
where again the Solway like am

489
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:24,760
on FB damn invitation to

490
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:29,880
enter the details and enter the CAPTCHA
code: on the capture cult

491
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:36,520
clay is fully for the operators was in
Russian up

492
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:40,700
however her there is the same poll way
to

493
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:44,770
circumvent its each and sent they
captured cold

494
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:48,380
popular servicemen people recognize
captcha codes

495
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:51,870
money which they did and on

496
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:55,330
the right tax is entered by the
application in the landing page

497
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:59,510
after thats up

498
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:03,240
the user and gets an ass ass ass kisser
whether you really want to get this

499
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,340
content

500
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:09,040
and the application obviously confirms
its

501
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,620
deleting all the correspondence in the
process

502
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:16,210
all the correspondence with the service
so what you see

503
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:21,240
are all the screenshots but this one of
the bank children's

504
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,120
so this particular

505
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:30,790
application starts sending requests to
all the popular services checking

506
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,430
whether

507
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:35,280
any cars or accounts are connected to
this particular

508
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,540
phone number and you say either all the
requests

509
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:42,300
are a return 0 answers our full sensors
that is

510
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:46,660
no Ceres as I can access yet he keeps
trying

511
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:53,740
and keeps deleting all this message is
up

512
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:57,950
and then he'll see that's when it
finally hits

513
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:01,400
the treasure trove it's sent all the
technical data

514
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,330
about the device about the user about
all his accounts

515
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:08,620
by an asset class insight for

516
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:12,940
to the C&C let me explain why we collect
all this information

517
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:17,679
because the bus

518
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,200
during I was the valuable thats up

519
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,690
well first and foremost

520
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:28,720
enables you to collect

521
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,250
a signature database that should enable
you to better

522
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:38,990
find dollar bills network secondly as we
rely on heuristic analysis and range of

523
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:39,829
aldose

524
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:45,000
up

525
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,809
we can use the same signature database
in order to identify the user's

526
00:34:49,809 --> 00:34:53,149
the subscribers that are expected to be
in the

527
00:34:53,149 --> 00:34:59,020
risk area and then you can for example
multi5

528
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:02,720
your subscribers that their devices must
have been

529
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,950
expose it's a great idea to install a

530
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:12,420
premium AV solution and that's exactly
what we are showcasing

531
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:16,460
here now the so different

532
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:20,010
MTS blank pages

533
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:23,740
say we don't really recommend to go
there

534
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:28,000
d a subscriber we cannot really
guarantee is curious device

535
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,410
please don't go there please download
and navy

536
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:36,569
and

537
00:35:36,569 --> 00:35:41,450
by the way if you distrust particular
cell operator he might like the fact

538
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:42,690
that up to the at

539
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:46,450
Google Chrome will also show

540
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:49,760
similar warnings might persuade some
people

541
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,510
help

542
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:58,069
MTS its place testing different

543
00:35:58,069 --> 00:36:03,369
language now we can't block

544
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:07,349
individual hostnames onto the Russian
legislation and obviously at this a

545
00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:10,079
great option it etiology to laws

546
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,750
old

547
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:19,069
in a tent health rollet money will be
stolen from a bank

548
00:36:19,069 --> 00:36:22,079
say C&C

549
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,440
Iran's within network of line operator

550
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,829
defrauding money from scratch so another
operator and

551
00:36:28,829 --> 00:36:33,569
a lecture is a subscriber list third
operator in this a great way for the

552
00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:34,420
baddies

553
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:38,349
to exploit the legal environment in this
country because the

554
00:36:38,349 --> 00:36:43,720
big three don't really talk much to each
other eventually

555
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:48,470
all the big three will be fined West

556
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:52,569
you know what now we have developed some
routines

557
00:36:52,569 --> 00:36:57,099
so all my recommendation Easton no
longer challenge doing that so

558
00:36:57,099 --> 00:36:58,180
subscribers

559
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:02,000
up obviously

560
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,930
the industry would greatly benefit from
developing a single search

561
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:10,990
censure by the way we are showing all
those Harris because in the you can

562
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:13,569
easily become politicized

563
00:37:13,569 --> 00:37:16,599
for money laundering purposes

564
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:21,559
the money will not simply go in like in
a straight line there will be a lot solo

565
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:22,710
sail

566
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:27,220
or exchange of data is extremely
difficult

567
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:31,200
in the current environment so it's clear
that the central bank last year

568
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,859
in russia and then had this initiative
FL to stop pushing lol national cert

569
00:37:35,859 --> 00:37:41,819
I hope a lot while operators are invited

570
00:37:41,819 --> 00:37:46,970
it's funny that the journalists have
down all that

571
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:50,090
plea have or small i think is the name
of the organization has been in

572
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,560
existence for two years

573
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,710
the F particles the after-tax Emmaus
they have agreements on how to exchange

574
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,710
information

575
00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:01,400
the heavens it's up and running it seems
to be very functional

576
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,410
the half gray least in the scoring us

577
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:07,780
built into the anti processors and it
doesn't take much

578
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:11,870
is just a communication routine for the
banks and the cell operators

579
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:16,790
and that the operators are free to use
information us they want for example if

580
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:19,250
they see a number they consider it
suspicious

581
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:22,890
a check against the database for example
I can block its

582
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:28,380
straightaway or they can just turn

583
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:32,190
not it's all in the name subscribers so
they should not really interact with

584
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,270
this particular number

585
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:37,060
Hollywood much better to block it

586
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:40,110
ants such research what's

587
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:43,940
certainly helped the industry fights the
him

588
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:46,960
widely spread baldness usually have a CC

589
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:53,080
one that's weird the rest in the other
well we certainly hope that will leave

590
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:53,990
to see

591
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:57,130
this he sure looked fighting

592
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:00,660
and painting catching foster's like that
would be very easy

593
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:04,910
but I think before this happens will
have all sorts of other

594
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:08,380
advanced threats to call best thank you
very much for attention

595
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:13,400
thank you for your interest I believe

596
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,060
this will be the if final part of our
research

597
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:22,270
big is a now that we've told you
everything we possibly could that's

598
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:38,620
the system will take on I like on

599
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:41,320
let you know my personal to the wood

600
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:45,970
indians we are broadcast everything so
please use my kikay

601
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:55,190
up

602
00:39:55,190 --> 00:40:00,710
you probably know there is the flip side
of the coin I'll

603
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:04,580
I'm not going to drop any

604
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:08,740
names a wheel no thats

605
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:13,230
corporators often distributes

606
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:16,360
anonymous seen cars lead to like

607
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:20,190
subway stations and it's very easy

608
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:26,070
to get those anonymous in cars in order
to

609
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:31,080
actually take money on the system's
stake they will be used by drops meals

610
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:34,080
and

611
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:38,030
s the head of information secure
department upon payment system

612
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:41,860
I belief this is one of the most
prevalent

613
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:45,350
for all channels under the current
legislation

614
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:50,170
in order to perform any monitoring
activities here maas

615
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:55,930
have aspirin details an anonymous in
cars will be blocked

616
00:40:55,930 --> 00:41:01,650
after some time right but there is this
limits right a fifteen thousand rubles

617
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:02,110
so

618
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:05,120
whatever amounts he held

619
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:17,050
billow be like three hundred dollars it
will be fun

620
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:20,220
for the probably mentions her both

621
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:24,970
in my opinion is nor a matter for
information security people is rather

622
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:25,940
something that

623
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,000
the other security i sposed to talk here
thinking about

624
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,410
word I mean I feel your pain

625
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:36,730
sir but I don't think thats this
particular

626
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:43,230
Darci be thrown at us yeah but you seem
to be part of MTS why don't you talk to

627
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,599
data security guys there

628
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:47,710
the guest this season deeds the

629
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:53,760
most widely years shadow absolutely
that's why we cite so important to

630
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,520
establish a common center that would
exchange information

631
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:03,390
okay thank you or questions please

632
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:11,200
I'm many as they can sell it in from
experience

633
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,820
I V considered

634
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:16,960
using the existing intro banks SS

635
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,970
such as national hunter because

636
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:25,320
we do have some systems in place that
are used by the actress to exchange

637
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:25,930
