1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,459
hello there

2
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:09,420
my name is on the same day and I'll tell
you about did

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,549
and cogeneration fortunate perch and FK
this is the specialized code generator

4
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:21,410
which so johnnie

5
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:27,240
is stay experimental code generator is
gonna global experiment result surveyed

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,500
have not yet been integrated and John
Draper

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,460
at the entry this code generator gets

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,610
the a description of the all gonna do it
in a specific language

9
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:42,909
and also the file with the settings up
how to optimize that algorithm

10
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:47,080
in the end we gotta see their the pure
see for John the Reaper

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,150
John the reporter is

12
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:54,900
well-known has crater

13
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,369
should mention the previous presentation

14
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:00,070
hair

15
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,610
and the main objective for its main
objective is to

16
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,750
church for weak passwords in the UNIX
systems however it also supports over

17
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,830
200 different performance a patch

18
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:13,520
that i seven cash in jumbo

19
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,760
this is the community enhanced version

20
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,130
are so it supports the war

21
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,110
one different competition device such as

22
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:30,640
process urs video cards with the GBG
Pune PGA

23
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:37,119
programmable hardware should be funny
and so on

24
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:45,400
up

25
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,480
the development stage for mint a certain
price because when there's up to my

26
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,090
zation

27
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:53,360
Mersey apply to all the formats and
certain up to my sessions are hard to be

28
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,050
applied to certain performance when
there are no caman

29
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:00,290
pieces in the code that's why I

30
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:05,050
first we optimize the more important for
manson certain performance remain an

31
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,119
optimized

32
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:11,160
also their support for every device on
which on works

33
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,370
and it requires a specific form in
separate from the two different

34
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,130
iteration

35
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:20,150
that's why certain optimizations such as
subject to race Asian

36
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,870
and open

37
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,530
helping them he supported uses Mac
recess in the communal

38
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,730
so be the low the process your

39
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:37,209
decreasing the good readability at the
coded

40
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:40,909
the object to the John dedicated to
separate the order it now but a musician

41
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:41,769
and the condo

42
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:45,439
she generate the code for different
devices

43
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:49,310
good surge on the cute kid also

44
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:54,090
must include given Obama's Asian perhaps
creating an John the Reaper

45
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,540
a.m. you can give the more convenience
in Texas

46
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:04,569
not to slow down speed and give the
precise control over optimization

47
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:08,319
spore different kind of

48
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,430
computational devices and provide

49
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:15,129
good perfect generation

50
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:20,879
out which provided very well track for
material prepared for Jon and Kate mice

51
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:21,389
P

52
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:26,009
Hamas give a good gig miss out a good
coach and idk it does not try to

53
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:29,439
make good kinda bad in every case is

54
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:34,829
in every case Sebastian that kid tries
to be more simple

55
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:38,919
we already got the results here and
while John deprecated

56
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:43,229
cannot be considered now to be a major
project yet we have seven performance

57
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:50,430
a realized and they have separate Co
their optimization the added

58
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:55,269
their sched to system got the boost the
speed boats and other formats:

59
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:56,870
UQM

60
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,080
slowdown that will be. will text at a

61
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,599
however the be you some interesting
pictures show me to tell about more

62
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,310
detail later

63
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:08,230
optimizations dunno eventually there's a
dramatic teacher is Asian the annual

64
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,110
cycles

65
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:13,840
the the early rejection are the best
candidates with Keith Brown hash

66
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,580
and

67
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,049
and additional Gu's up from

68
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:23,660
bigger packages so the cycle around the
algorithms gonna be good

69
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,210
all the formats get the optimization
just with their the

70
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:33,140
with by clicking in the context up

71
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:38,520
what about the process letting the hatch

72
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,190
we are in this a position on the
attacker and we have a lot of candidates

73
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,080
to check

74
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,520
so that's why the and this the parallel
work

75
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,900
it's always present we'd only the
algorithm to be paroled

76
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,890
El Pelon on the pellets always parallel
and

77
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:58,010
the general viewed simplification can
imagine the tracking algorithm

78
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:01,580
as the Lord hatch and generation up
certain set of candidates

79
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,330
accommodation the hash in them air war
partial called

80
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,570
competition hash I read their rejection
advil

81
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:12,200
not probable ken is

82
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,470
cantaloupe ability or durability and
then the more precise check

83
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,870
we do the website you got the possible
candidate geisha kami the passwords

84
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:24,180
after that we year repeat the process
with a generation the candidates

85
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,199
and

86
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,380
John uses the interface to you describe
the performance that

87
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,919
reminds the object-oriented interface
the

88
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:39,130
and thanks to cart accident

89
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,710
certain optimize sation is not specific
for the algorithms and does not touch

90
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,449
them in any way such as the support of
public employees

91
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:49,510
and they increase our the candid catch

92
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:53,030
other a demise ations

93
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:58,330
to our tight the it tightly interact
with the algorithms that kinda and

94
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,530
optimizations include but to raise a
shindig calculation of

95
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:06,210
the the preliminary calculations a
certain part you can have certain parts

96
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,000
repeating

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,139
in as a great no one can compute

98
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:14,680
a certain operations in vans because sir

99
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,130
certain operations are unchanged also
the

100
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:23,060
addresses the calls the operations the
loops

101
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,650
initially he spit slicing it other
optimizations

102
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,720
is less requires a separate attention
because

103
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,590
ed

104
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,440
separates

105
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,930
weekend it's to bits and cheats bits
like

106
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:44,220
with via bit operations in the meantime

107
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,240
bits are put into the better tell you
that we have it via Twitter zation

108
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,280
to 64 E 120 your friend and 5

109
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,160
12 a petition on arXiv e-prints b-sides

110
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,340
the the optimizations actually

111
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,310
the a position of the pockets or bleed

112
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:08,260
for Millis that has a huge background
and prepare large-scale degraded

113
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:08,990
circuits

114
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:13,040
for John the repaired Roman a sec of has
generated

115
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,970
following formulas just moved by going
through them

116
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:21,160
%uh that took spur three months and
after that solar designer

117
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,000
and improved the scheduling instructions
and that formulas are I'm

118
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,840
being used now they're generated by the
software Billy Bob roomy and showed

119
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,120
the use I love learn

120
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,310
be artificial

121
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:44,210
burning to improve the scheduling know
the instructions

122
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,320
into did and boxes

123
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,750
in addition the instructions were
repeated

124
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,250
connected to the process here and that
get God gave thats

125
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:59,500
temps and boost so considered the
generation the card including the

126
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,800
advanced algorithms is not something new
for John the reader

127
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,880
up

128
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,910
when I start talking about the out for
different platforms and I'm up nast

129
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:14,860
there's open CL what's what's with that
what's so bad about it

130
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,430
well let's start with baghdad

131
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,760
syntex is very happy

132
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,370
it sees index is very heavy and Janet
get provides a simplicity has also been

133
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,190
see a compiler

134
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,930
doesn't know anything about John the
Reaper and

135
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,870
it cannot transfer the code between the
functions in the format

136
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:39,110
and also it doesn't have any animated
pic slicers

137
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:47,950
at the minute and many pets lies is
generally a very rare optimization

138
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:48,190
now

139
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:52,480
John does have montana for months some
mechanism that

140
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,950
laws you to combine cryptographic
primitives

141
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:59,399
to get some kind condoms hasher's

142
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:02,450
md5 and if I have on

143
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,930
this password and use the same in base

144
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:09,670
of my source code and they don't repeat
md5

145
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:13,190
or MD final and if I these one piece of
code not too big

146
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,360
ones junk if

147
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,450
kid intends good

148
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,079
do it do the same II

149
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:28,459
during compilation getting morow the
code but without possibility to optimize

150
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:34,410
if we calculate md5 from md5 before the
second md5 always know the

151
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,949
length because there is also the first
to

152
00:09:37,949 --> 00:09:41,589
and 25 always have

153
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:44,819
fixed-length can see there are Michael

154
00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:48,160
Ste and a used lot in John and other

155
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,240
project giving great opportunities but
they are not

156
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,079
that sophisticated this is an example

157
00:09:56,079 --> 00:10:00,420
over code from algorithm

158
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,569
pitch kachuck

159
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:06,709

00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,230
Michael technique is also interesting

163
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,259
runs in part to the code is to

164
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:24,139
put into a separate file and

165
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:27,610
before me including this file

166
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:32,339
durables on defiant and the file can be
used as a template

167
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:36,220
on are you he is so that

168
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:40,630
in and NHA

169
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,170
encrypt and net

170
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:47,230
BST no and this is when

171
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:52,850
Maxxis included cool and to fall

172
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,010
the route from definition to

173
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:01,030
just seein John looks like this from a
reason definition

174
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:05,210
you get the to me did

175
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:08,530
and a presentation intimate language in
which is a

176
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:12,480
modified with the filters user-defined

177
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,710
soldiers that is the user will
differently

178
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:20,400
control all the changes that happen with
the code decompiler does not do anything

179
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,920
itself after that you get

180
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,990
Mia these a seed coat mission

181
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:34,850
intermediate representation is needed to
simplify would

182
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:39,520
what you do with a cold algorithms are
described in Cle in clean pie from

183
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,470
mint and the representation is very
simple and it's

184
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:49,020
actually and masts of instructions there
instructions are very

185
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,400
simple the just a few arguments and

186
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,840
mmm

187
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,890
one result in so the intermediate

188
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:02,650
the language good

189
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:06,040
has instructions for number is Nick
hashing

190
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,280
like her one which describes the
terrible

191
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,560
function wearable stage in the function
which is used

192
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,560
in some filters this

193
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,400
use of special instructions for
different structures

194
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:27,100
me is makes optimization easier because
they optimize it does not have to

195
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,290
bildt just structures but

196
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:34,520
he is taking those which are ready this
is an example a specific construction

197
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,030
and an example

198
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:41,300
for the code in the US has such a joy to
to follow is different from

199
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,590
256 in different ways in

200
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:47,650
the its is different the different terms
of a

201
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,670
in initial stage and one

202
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:59,680
output is also mmm reduced to bed

203
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,399
so me all the work with the bytecode can
not be

204
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,749
very small functional now part
optimization

205
00:13:07,749 --> 00:13:11,160
which is specific to savant

206
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:16,129
cracking and specific to John the Ripper
we as compiler

207
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,600
users have knowledge that

208
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,230
conventional compiler does not have a
camera cord between functions and can

209
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:23,759
use

210
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,889
knowledge about the probability
twelve-hour

211
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,029
functions to be called the main

212
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:33,259
hashing function is always used in part
to

213
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:37,259
the functional for United

214
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:40,480
precise shock verification is a

215
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,110
not always use but only for candidates
who good

216
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:49,069
are passwords with a high degree of
probability

217
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:53,139
and deal with this work and can
calculate the

218
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:59,050
main functions not been all hash

219
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,160
passion is long have

220
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:05,470
my number of meanings we are happy with
the one

221
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:10,259
32 or 40 a 6-bit so from the main
function we

222
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:14,470
no it take away those operations that

223
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:18,910
we do not need to be for calculation the
whole called

224
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:22,850
that is used for the rest of the
calculation is

225
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,629
the taken out but we lose the
possibility for

226
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:30,259
precise passion

227
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:34,019
unification n22 hy-vee

228
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:38,879
need to do that you have to calculate
hash again butts and

229
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,509
and an expensive operation but it's so
rare

230
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:47,000
is so really use the cam disregarded

231
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,699
and this implementation will this Caleb
all to

232
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:53,899
implement such optimization we need to
have to

233
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:59,040
ruin plantations to text or and scaler
for our

234
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,470
verification its the not too easy to do
many only but

235
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:07,079
John F Kate man john didn't get 02 02
mates that

236
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:11,189
both for that and with actor and scaler
the optimizations

237
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:17,570
use this same algorithm description

238
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:21,090
one interesting optimization is a

239
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:24,750
reversal or operations like addition

240
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,830
when Leah see that

241
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:32,530
Int you know in the cash was obtained

242
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:36,520
by application of constant when can
deduct the constant and a/c

243
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,450
the the issue to a statement one
operation

244
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:44,140
earlier its once for

245
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,360
passion %ah transfer candidate they're
not

246
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,600
as many house as candidates it's a
benefit

247
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,030
but when need to move colds

248
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:57,380
to unknown places so it's a it should be
a reverse

249
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,650
cold without the restructuring and other
instructions and

250
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:04,360
John deaf kid does that in named John
did get

251
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,650
who can use ball python we did not
Turnpike name to the language

252
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:12,400
but to wean planted to domain-specific
language within the Python

253
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,560
using objects with overloaded

254
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:21,540
operations

255
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,770
in this way we can apply precise control

256
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:28,440
and in some cases we can use overpower

257
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,240
by phone to get by eight called but this
is always come going to be four byte

258
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,020
code and

259
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,570
for optimization starts so in well
mapped formats

260
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:41,540
he will not no need to do that

261
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:49,120
this is an example of MD for coded

262
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,730
which to compiles that cold turkey
quickly from

263
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:58,350
RC and described as

264
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:03,070
is described as two numbers in a
brackets

265
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:06,220
good toasts calculated T

266
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,930
within the format its also then
disclosing to or

267
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:13,209
separate instruction and optimizes in
ninety sintesi

268
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:18,260
language without functional

269
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,850
to you can conclude from that but John
depth with kit

270
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:26,020
demonstrates how you can practically
apply code generation because

271
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,329
cogeneration is

272
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:31,730
something which is very general

273
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:36,370
you cannot always know if it will be
useful what the hell ditional John F

274
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:40,890
defecate a appears to be a practical
optimization

275
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:44,630
solution because you can do a musician
once and then apply it although the

276
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,530
rhythms which are described for it

277
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:52,380
thank you

278
00:17:52,380 --> 00:18:08,760
questions please

279
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,390
you

280
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,670
did you apply your software product to
only two hash

281
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:18,430
as that you showed on the slide the

282
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,120
nation md5 what about the russian-made
standard

283
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,510
not yet but will do that's definitely
because a

284
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:29,170
John Does suppose to rebook to us

285
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,710
and it's just in weeks week ago when a

286
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:37,120
hasher on our my PhD is a test was

287
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:52,090
down and we will automate that

288
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,799
you were showing implementations

289
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,960
with Jewel and John diff --git or take a
standard algorithms

290
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,909
s4 applications

291
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:07,789
algorithms which use md5 in

292
00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:10,899
with intent it is something we can write

293
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:15,000
in Python and compilat and seen is that

294
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:22,540
right yes potentially sell and with that

295
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,480
John specific optimization will not be
available because

296
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,300
is you will not said achieve it in

297
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,419
barrel because I think what you are

298
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,930
asking for is a one candidate one time

299
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:41,490
but not in packages of thousands on the
other hand was started with generation

300
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:41,920
code

301
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,550
for hash and computation without

302
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:50,850
John and at the times which I use now
are more or less

303
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:54,460
disassociated from John it can separate

304
00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:07,040
kids from John up

305
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,930
thank you for questions
