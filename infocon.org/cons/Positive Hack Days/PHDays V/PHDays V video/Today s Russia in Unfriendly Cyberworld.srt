way here

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:17,080
were afraid that there would be fewer
people think

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,270
we have a walk everyone want to come
came

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,050
there so we have this section

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,410
it's a kinda facetious name

9
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:32,270
all this because they are trying to
chill

10
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:37,460
have us but we're getting stronger this
is not the first time

11
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,650
we've been trying to organize section
sir

12
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:45,379
about the relationship between the state
and security

13
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:50,750

a representative for audience request we
have a representative suffer different

15

the 57 minutes and no more than that and

17
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,830

00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,120
this year in this a lot the general
philosophical understanding that this

50
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,820
issue but

51
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,950
but beer the the real trends and the

52
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,850
their situations and how they will
address those challenges

53
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,350
take care and what your bills

54
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,489
the in the pipeline and then your expert

55
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:33,190

yesterday we had a presenter for Foreign
Affairs Minister for FS

a confusing one

59
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,250
but we have in agreement with over
Russia with other

60
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,049
cunt countries concerning the
identification of threat to the same

61
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:52,299
time rush doesn't want to join
international

62
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:57,350
conventions like a Personal Data
Exchange Program answer what what

63
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,590
changed this year

64
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,500
so we this one way or the other what Rd
changes

65
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,100
what other developments a think you're

66
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,220
would like to thank the organizers to
participate

67
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:17,320

thank you

69
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,819
first I would quickly touch upon

70
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:29,889
for sign up

71
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:33,509
enough to talk about Donald joining and
conventions for documents

72
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:37,940
I will just identify a some a major
political trends

73
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:42,360
so into or occurred that they have
occurred to over the last year and a

74
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,680
surrender all over russia

75
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,639
and the international security

76
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,120
the irena and how the situation is
evolving

77
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,810
from the viewpoint of our relationship
but the key

78
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:01,940
a international stakeholders them and
the so there isn't agonism certain

79
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,759
degree oven

80
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:07,750
hang in there is rumor so in there I'm
between different groups of countries

81
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:12,460
international countries so then the

82
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,539
two diametrically opposite approaches

83
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:18,650
first approach first to protect your
mates

84
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,440
Persa this the group or for Western
countries and their partners

85
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,610
which is as follows: so that the
legalization of

86
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:31,319
existing international law and norms and
conventions and agreements existing

87
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:33,729
aimed at at

88
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:38,659
legalizing the information legalizing of
cyber wars

89
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:42,310
mother and cyber worsened and

90
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:47,419
so they so for example so then the even
the international humanitarian law

91
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:51,310
assault you are so tenderly gold illegal
a

92
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,380
lost sir concerning a

93
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:58,240
declaring war sir so

94
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,270
conducting war since a cyberwar sis I
about to

95
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:06,770
offensive cyber potential so the
country's standard application this is

96
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:07,120
all

97
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,240
official talk this what they're
discussing and

98
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,800
this is down and and the remaining and
the many countries that fully realize

99
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,039
that our world

100
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:19,990
is so unstable and the shaky and they're
so there are many

101
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:25,680
a hot spots a in other domain so lower
in the Indian airspace

102
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,750
earth and then a cyber

103
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,399
space a so would further complicate

104
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,599
allies and these are the country's were
talking about the developing countries

105
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:40,779
Sam Russia and and power bricks

106
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:44,509
partners that call for are

107
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:47,880
call for so not to use force in

108
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,259
I T E space from so do they

109
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:54,339
speak for themselves or day come out to
the consolidated

110
00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:59,050
to up so now talking yes and no general
because there are no specific group A

111
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:02,339
because certainly we've gone through
this a block

112
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:05,759
at the ritz and because russia does not
adhere to the block thinking

113
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,139
and M that is why so we says in a group
of countries that

114
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:14,120
that share the same approach Anderson
there are many developing countries

115
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,740
right now sundar

116
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:20,779
and and so the bricks area Rd leading
developing countries so they

117
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:24,430
share our views that we should not apply
forcing

118
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:28,430
in it. space in cyberspace and there
should be certain your

119
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:33,130
a set of cold of responsible behavior
should be adopted

120
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,139
and that and Russia his

121
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:40,520
is going to participate this summer and
some kind of an agreement or hammer out

122
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,380
an agreement

123
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,350
so the bricks a

124
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,860
contras after their 4-2 last summit last
year

125
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,340
so that the brought to the breaks it to
a different level of cooperation closely

126
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:51,860
was a

127
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,540
so there's that we're a group that was
founded to no acepta

128
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,380
within the BRICS countries achieve this
format prescribed

129
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:04,880
my very complex for my for math but
nevertheless we're moving over to your

130
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,710
now very interesting and practical
initiatives some

131
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:14,290
on the other hand has you set correctly
so practical initiatives

132
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:18,100
yes or russia and our partners son

133
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:22,660
see all and shine human in 20 2011

134
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,790
2011 came out with initiative I'll
setting the rules

135
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:31,110
behavior and a row IT security globally
so which is a

136
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,620
which is a kind ever a model at drafter

137
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,620
are are over cold or behavior

138
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,309
now the

139
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:42,379
so that that that that would settle a

140
00:08:42,379 --> 00:08:45,490
so the relationship and not escalate the
conflict in cyberspace

141
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:50,079
and the way a what was the final

142
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:53,850
agreement or whatever a

143
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:58,680
no no nothing has been developed
specifically we're not talking about the

144
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,860
specific to a legal documents or
agreement somoza behavior

145
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,019
it's not the area because there is a
have as

146
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:10,339
many don't want understand they just
won't understand politically motivated

147
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:12,639
but we can we can use

148
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,189
worker within the framework of over a
soft lawn the

149
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:18,480
hers solutions are the

150
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,550
General Assembly so that the country's
may choose to

151
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,190
join or not to join us on there are some

152
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,280
drafts and projects that are being

153
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,230
and developed a right now but its by
itself it sure is a great teacher

154
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,900
because there's no consensus

155
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,949
there's no consensus there's no common
ground yet and

156
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:41,630
and so maybe it makes no sense that you
sign a new comprehensive international

157
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,920
agreements on that account

158
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,300
at this point so that's a

159
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,620
sorry there any further questions sir in
Los welcome to

160
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,120
go ahead and I'd like to apologize at
your issue

161
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,430
house key I forgot to introduce him I'm

162
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,170
because a he

163
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:04,430
so participants I'm sorry that I didn't
see him

164
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,520
them to the table I Gonski

165
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:13,610
here so famous expert on IT security in
this so that the brink said these issues

166
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,690
to the attention of the legislation
authorities some

167
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:21,960
and this on our way on so now let's I
think that makes me feel like an hour

168
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,000
will come out of his a

169
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,470
a viewpoints concerning the threats sure
they

170
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,680
ask you any leading questions or now

171
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,730
not hi

172
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,870
now we all think about the war in
Ukraine

173
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,180
to and maybe in this in this connection

174
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,230
certain things have changed because
we're

175
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,860
we hear about different story sir
concerning your so

176
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,100
tapping in the conversations having
cyber

177
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:55,649
that day they say will be mounted what

178
00:10:55,649 --> 00:10:59,290
what is being done on dis score good

179
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:04,560
have morning ladies and gentlemen so
first little digression so the eighth

180
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,680
Center so is is there they exist cecil
was a small mistake

181
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,899
misprint and concerning the war in
Ukraine

182
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:19,399
time II in cyberspace nothing has
changed because of that

183
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:23,310
doing a different so there is a haven
for

184
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:29,329
criminals were used so there's that the
authorities

185
00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:32,720
in the Ministry of Interior doesn't
workers so they're not going to do

186
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,709
hackers not a time so on so would for
the logical implications so massive tax

187
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:43,120
hacking so what otherwise it's not it's
not yet highly pronounce that might the

188
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,779
criminal

189
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:48,690
criminals other from and then I would
identify one issue

190
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:54,380
toward the on challenge would isolate so
then the positive hackers they got

191
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:54,990
together

192
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:58,490
wonderful this is great so the they're
helping nature

193
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:01,899
and they're so in order to do that when
its own legislation so that the positive

194
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:04,350
hackers will help each other to a
greater extent

195
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,410
and I think that next year so we'll get

196
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,980
so well a sadat this law

197
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,140
so that'll put the security in the right

198
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:19,110
now on on the right track and %uh so
then a

199
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,579
and then I will not just I will not talk
more about that

200
00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:27,529
because I don't want to dilute my point
today love my point

201
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:31,199
under then I'll be asking some russians

202
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:34,230
so the law I will

203
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:37,279
I will be will do will address

204
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:43,019
well it s everyone every and they're so
the owners and the expert authority

205
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:46,999
especially agencies who are involved in
that guaranteeing security ensuring

206
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:47,870
security

207
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:51,240
a and they're so than others David

208
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,370
division responsibilities her et cetera

209
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:59,199
rights but I'm not going just tour or
this law with the

210
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:02,740
the with the fine call because

211
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,120
it needs it's certainly a mending
improving

212
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,459
and the correcting adjusting its chill
its tail

213
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:12,569
being hammered out and they're so now
justice

214
00:13:12,569 --> 00:13:17,689
it said the stage are being presented to
this stage you my from the government

215
00:13:17,689 --> 00:13:22,519
I'm so last year and that competition of
positive hack

216
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:28,249
days in two days sunday found ten
critical vulnerabilities

217
00:13:28,249 --> 00:13:31,490
last year so Scott

218
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:35,209
so the National their act lik made and
those cat

219
00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:38,660
scare the system so they are installed
in in incur

220
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:43,139
incur and their corporate a corporate
products so then the year

221
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:47,519
and has passed and they say thank you
very much sir

222
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,959
like to thank our hackers that they
found those vulnerabilities

223
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,170
and

224
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:57,150
some figures the the day found us on
their abilities at the corporate level

225
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:00,880
and it to them on a one hour but it took
almost a year just to

226
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,840
take care of those vulnerabilities and
to remove their threats

227
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,550
and their official teaser now

228
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,800
so do care legislation going to go into
this sector lot

229
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,280
karna those who were suppose to

230
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,870
her fix it so those are mostly foreign
developers and they're so they don't

231
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,650
care for

232
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:24,670
about the russian law what if they work
in the russian alignment the same but

233
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,180
they don't care about the Russian

234
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,970
but they do it because their prestige
I'm and the

235
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:34,100
so then when we introduce the state
system

236
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,750
are liquidation prevention are threats

237
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,810
nasa and the so hard at the

238
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:44,570
Ford information resources on the
Russian Federation and

239
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,990
some mechanisms of combating counteract
them

240
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:51,290
Soho House should behave on there what's

241
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:55,390
which circumstances need to be isolated
anger so there are some

242
00:14:55,390 --> 00:15:00,550
on a we have put her in the balls
together and

243
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,500
somewhere it's part of the state concept
odious

244
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,040
state security system that was a
approved by the president

245
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,160
so it's available always

246
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,470
re the meaning and and in their handle

247
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:19,320
while I B which is there as well okay
pulitzer go for their

248
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,959
hi I'm afraid to ask your

249
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,160
leading leading questions certain a to
represent a tear for our the Federal Tax

250
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,889
Service

251
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:34,620
suffers there wanted to comment

252
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:39,139
and a per the species speech or mine
call it from the Ministry of Foreign

253
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:39,610
Affairs

254
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:43,589
say things that as a practicing her
security guy

255
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:46,990
thing that the in cyberspace relations
between two states

256
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:50,519
there are no rules as the main role in
cyberspace though he

257
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:54,630
a so the strongest does whatever he damn
well pleases

258
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:58,930
and this is the mineral I'm in
international relations against Satan

259
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:03,040
every site every object every every
gadget

260
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,800
you can see that so than their actual
very important to us moments

261
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,350
the how these threats

262
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:15,050
and manifested themselves in recent
years and now

263
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:18,779
practice and Tax Service and and the
whole

264
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:24,120
our liberators see that we have big
systems like an affair

265
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,600
pension fund center so the third

266
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,589
is a so then the incidence increased

267
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:36,140
so used to be on the reference systems
now they're functional systems

268
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,149
number users counting

269
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:44,250
scores on millions of people and they're
so there to raise too many challenges

270
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:48,560
so this is this safe security or the
user in the banking system so there's

271
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,610
lots of money

272
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,899
and the and the user is not protected

273
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:58,060
and some more over so the user has so
many vulnerabilities in these guys is

274
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,250
that he is not in there

275
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,990
where r and continue to use electronic
services

276
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:08,670
my trial but while the mistake I was set
as salt n

277
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:13,319
ascertain to the minus a surf third
power

278
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:16,550
not was almost nothing 410 to the minus

279
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:21,220
fourth were so was almost nothing but
now so the system growing

280
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:26,420
and they're so the vulnerability is
becoming more and more dangerous in soda

281
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,030
a thousand so for a

282
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:33,040
aggrieved parties from now

283
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,930
and that is why so we can conclude that
there are no

284
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:40,360
new implications sir and

285
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,970
and the really just to see how this

286
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:48,150
information security analyst American I
so how do we did that before so we're

287
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,670
building intesa but we did this already

288
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,740
and formation security that was part of
the system it wasn't bad at it was

289
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,360
working and it worked fine

290
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,970
at but now how can you possibly do that

291
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,270
if you're forty me million users say
it's impossible

292
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:09,630
anger so not want two or three hundred
dollars to protect their computer

293
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,720
and and because the computer cause the
same

294
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,210
amount of money man

295
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:19,640
and that is right I was saying in the
near future

296
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,980
a Saudi so the the protection
deprotection

297
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,980
invalid at the beginning when the device
is purchased

298
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,110
I so is going to die out because
unfortunately

299
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:32,679
its only wise after the event approach
and for this

300
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:37,750
at so when the just two and to develop
new legislation when it to find new ways

301
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:42,649
to catch those bad guys and 18 to
modernize and calibrate our

302
00:18:42,649 --> 00:18:46,500
a for in our information system

303
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:51,679
and our special agency's operation
operations at seven that's exactly what

304
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:52,840
we're getting to see

305
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:58,649
on increasing scale and they're so as we
proceed progress so they will be more

306
00:18:58,649 --> 00:18:59,600
and more dangers

307
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,690
and they're so it means that they're the
to

308
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:06,809
so the the Google hackers as a result if
the past

309
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:09,950
the and the interim right at at

310
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:14,529
at had early stages everyone just will
have to set up a small hacker department

311
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:14,850
right

312
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:18,100
this is this is is this is what I'm
afraid of

313
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,970
so I'm talking about the is because from

314
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:25,880
surfaces so the in

315
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,679
in persists in July the first we and we

00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:44,240
many complications sir has so when for
example

320
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,279

326
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,789
dangerous

327
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:09,590
pick us very detrimental and surrender
for tens of millions of people

328
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:14,270
sooo this this a Saudi password theft

329
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:17,270
is is very dire and and the system

330
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:20,459
cannot be even held responsible for that

331
00:20:20,459 --> 00:20:23,979
and amber it's a certain a direct
throughout

332
00:20:23,979 --> 00:20:28,699
her to the well-being call for thousands
of companies some

333
00:20:28,699 --> 00:20:33,549
so that's why this is this a moment to
the mass functional systems

334
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:36,989
through what is going to happen

335
00:20:36,989 --> 00:20:42,879
very certain very shortly and the server
can see that they're so they will be

336
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,429
stealing from your wallet

337
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:49,179

and may suffer

339
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:53,769
okay so how we how we

340
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:57,319
fight the Western service providers

341
00:20:57,319 --> 00:21:00,999
once the new rules on the front Turner
so how do we

342
00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:04,519
combat the bad guys okay good morning

343
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:07,819
happened to a sort of process
respectable on your ass and I

344
00:21:07,819 --> 00:21:11,519
a social points concerning the ukraine

345
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:16,349
and so so there's a ministry of
propaganda than this setup which

346
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:20,389
which is financed the from abroad
definitely a western money

347
00:21:20,389 --> 00:21:24,649
and urself fourteen million fear is a
forty million dollar said been there

348
00:21:24,649 --> 00:21:27,719
and have been earmarked for

349
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:33,009
so developing hacker attacks on on the
Russian Federation and the sorter

350
00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:37,949
be doing so the resources of the Russian
Federation so and SR 42 million dollars

351
00:21:37,949 --> 00:21:43,369
and have been invested in that effort
and a son and the internet for a for

352
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,789
understand that seventeen million people

353
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:48,979
her are under net are

354
00:21:48,979 --> 00:21:52,779
on the Internet every day 17 on in the
Russian Federation seventeen million

355
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:55,760
and so the

356
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,960
some 12 million sorry for long one

357
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,370
I encroaches

358
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:07,220
on your opinions and they can say
whatever you want but you need to

359
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,820
remember the implications

360
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,610
because if you say something then you
need to confirm your ad's

361
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:16,799
unit 2 Assoc to put your money where
your mouth is

362
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,740
and the you need to stand up for
yourself and Sonu to prove that what you

363
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,460
say is sincere open

364
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,600
and that you don't hurt anybody's
feelings and

365
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,779
because we we think that anything
anything goes

366
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:32,190
anything is possible that the same time
we just don't realize how important it

367
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:32,690
is to

368
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:36,039
to be responsible and a statement so

369
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:40,720
and %uh so that there are many bloggers
so that

370
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,789
that torpedo different personalities
institutions so horrible

371
00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:49,220
so what is happening but not many have
been put away yeah

372
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:53,360
and some but we need to speed right so
today the registered

373
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,429
somewhere they said something that after
tomorrow they just they

374
00:22:57,429 --> 00:23:01,659
they put put him in jail and number
three we cannot kitchen for camp can do

375
00:23:01,659 --> 00:23:02,029
that

376
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:06,230
for so rapidly because by the time to
realize something is wrong so they're

377
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,309
far the worst and

378
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:11,370
so their annual terrorists a cyber
terrorists

379
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:14,570
and unfortunately cannot catch up with
that

380
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:17,929
there were fully realized that this
state institutions

381
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:22,559
debates enhance that her strength and
finance the so those against him or his

382
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:22,940
own

383
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,299
because the yeah because the High Tea
him

384
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:30,940
environment is part of our lives occurs
when they went to trick people because

385
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,360
they

386
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,380
they develop psychotic disorders and
mental

387
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,260
borderline mental incentives syndrome so

388
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:42,320
so it's all day so then the than
personal

389
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,390
personal data the story should be in
Russia

390
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:50,570
the salon logical because we know that
the Internet is european-american but

391
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:52,409
across russia under this common thing

392
00:23:52,409 --> 00:23:55,470
at all all data is stored abroad

393
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:58,760
and amend the Russian Federation

394
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,370
so man they're presented by the
government in other legislators who

395
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,049
spoke

396
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:06,610
about this initiative called for this
that they had a personal

397
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:10,330
the had a tougher so you're officially a
stored in Russia

398
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:13,330
for some reason so there that the whole
world

399
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:18,059
got excited I don't know why and that so
for example medical

400
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:21,730
data a person the majority sup than

401
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:25,530
when so they so when they promise from
the west to Corpus

402
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:29,210
of from the internet after and so if
they do they're

403
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:33,210
how her again to treat our patients so
what do we do with it so well

404
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:36,690
so where does this information call for
uses this information

405
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:40,270
as I we cannot guarantee we as
legislator

406
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,549
we cannot guarantee our users this
security

407
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:47,559
are and their data storage so only when
something went wrong

408
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:52,070
so the starter so so yelling for the
state to help

409
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:57,960
so as long as it's not doesn't concern
you personally who use a person that you

410
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,650
don't care

411
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:03,630
and this error simply hine sir

412
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:07,150
they stole from me recently

413
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:12,059
from that

414
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:16,700
so there's still some money from me I
called the bank and I sent to query

415
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,980
sounding so special a special girl per

416
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,620
seating de reseau then the whole some

417
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,680
so when they're when they're when they
are buying something on the internet

418
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,510
there just the writing of certain
amounts from your account

419
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:33,559
so this is true that they found it and
disarm under say so

420
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:37,470
when the Russian Federation has no right
to store personal data

421
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:42,570
and Russia and thus I find it difficult
to understand

422
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:46,320
why her and they're not happy although
so they

423
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,400
this store the data from in their own
countries

424
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,230
do not want to rush into store is the
the Russian and handle

425
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,600
so the

426
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,899
shit like Google quit on China

427
00:25:59,899 --> 00:26:04,259
settle the issue for them took 2004 for
Google to quit on russia

428
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:08,139
and so2 Lee Russia for good there so
there is a threat

429
00:26:08,139 --> 00:26:11,379
and so can we possibly close them call

430
00:26:11,379 --> 00:26:16,769
ISO web for browsers & mail and what
they were because there is no

431
00:26:16,769 --> 00:26:20,629
there is no Russian go that nothing to
replace it with

432
00:26:20,629 --> 00:26:25,559
now there's no need to do that and a
demand the company is now just a

433
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:29,470
as saying that with the need to postpone
the adoption

434
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:33,369
%uh this this and this law coming into
fact but always tell them that the

435
00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:34,580
majority of the company's

436
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,679
came out to the it. information policy
committee

437
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,700
and discuss this issue so they're ready

438
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,259
in three months time to introduce this

439
00:26:44,259 --> 00:26:47,730
this this machine hand and keep

440
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:51,019
and stored information Russian no
problem to that site takes

441
00:26:51,019 --> 00:26:55,039
the company three months to do that
storing information the National sir

442
00:26:55,039 --> 00:27:00,110
so even just introduce the tax and judea

443
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:03,730
those those cool import this equipment
so

444
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:06,889
your day it to develop and and build
their own equipment here

445
00:27:06,889 --> 00:27:11,269
Russia and Canada stored in Russia how
watch them from there's no point to

446
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:14,389
imported house about minister to

447
00:27:14,389 --> 00:27:17,529
her a so too

448
00:27:17,529 --> 00:27:20,300
to ask for favors

449
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,490
and to make an exception for themselves

450
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:27,410
to save money and two culture

451
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:31,920
somehow this to tiptoe around this law
and not to be affected by this law

452
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,190
and sir from ickes business is very
flexible owner

453
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:40,820
that Knowles their to and Eddie realizes
the need to invest in securities

454
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:44,100
man that's a must because certainly

455
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,930
security in the incinerator invest so
you can just

456
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:51,190
and make a little money big profits are
in years

457
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:55,330
but the litter need a constructive
dialogue about the protection of

458
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:59,310
personal data for the state is more
important than anything else and their

459
00:27:59,310 --> 00:27:59,800
needs

460
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:04,080
and this information is the distorted
version there's nothing horrible about

461
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,070
it it's nothing out of the common and

462
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:10,680
and I don't think that that's big
corporations to us would leave the

463
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,750
country only because they have to store

464
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:16,020
maybe like Microsoft in China they will

465
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:21,320
set list with the with authorities as
soon as a constructive dialogue going on

466
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,170
we have made your present is coming to
our community and

467
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,250
so solid very important points and

468
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:32,370
so seldom so for example or so then

469
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:37,270
and so for example the security that
system all their corporation the

470
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:39,549
p sp the

471
00:28:39,549 --> 00:28:42,649
pits against the a the

472
00:28:42,649 --> 00:28:47,029
the security system Harvard data centers
for example saddam in your purse wetter

473
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:47,619
than ever

474
00:28:47,619 --> 00:28:51,950
never seen any big corporation a small
company so that was doubt

475
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:55,350
the importance a the law

476
00:28:55,350 --> 00:29:00,169
on personal data and I think technical
annex to the settlement at a later stage

477
00:29:00,169 --> 00:29:04,850
and 72 the have ensured results is the
only the Internet

478
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:08,860
cumbersome came out to avoid this lock
to postponed a survey

479
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:12,090
at this low coming into factor by one
year

480
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:16,379
I'm against it because why there were
started in the first place so why

481
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:20,159
I was the Russian are protected because
they could be cut off from today to any

482
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,700
they say anyone can store them use them
for a bit

483
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:27,100
half about purposes it can can happen
and that's why those for your personal

484
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,749
data should be responsible be interested
in having their data

485
00:29:30,749 --> 00:29:33,830
say France toward in the in their own
country

486
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:37,820
there

487
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:43,539
well as follow-up and their I know I
initiated the similar restrictions for

488
00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:44,179
instance

489
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:49,340
her to restrict the the use of no
internet services for the

490
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:54,389
good defense %uh for the military people
and does and the four other officials

491
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:58,879
or other to explain to educate so that
we would be paying points

492
00:29:58,879 --> 00:30:03,690
so that you know out for instance I'm
know someone puts our Terms as a whole

493
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:05,100
new with the unit on fed

494
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:09,320
Facebook with the movement and activity
is so is there any her

495
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,509
advance so in that activity or

496
00:30:12,509 --> 00:30:16,820
the initiative for has just been lost
for so thank you for the question Sep

497
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,570
her

498
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:21,330
you raised the topics of the twenty 11
2012 so

499
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:25,029
this information security are is in the
head to

500
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:29,779
primarily in the brains of the user's to
either

501
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:35,859
appreciate to or do not care what's
happening to the web at

502
00:30:35,859 --> 00:30:38,980
so they can estimate the risks to
balance says so

503
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,789
and sometimes they give a little to the
big corporations the big corporation

504
00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:46,080
man returns nothing to them so

505
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,170
3 reliability cannot exceed

506
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:53,710
does the in Mount Isa we pay for the
service but as usual we pay nothing and

507
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,000
their

508
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,610
be for and military percent or official

509
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:05,200
trust so so so irresponsible consumer
services this situation is abnormal so I

510
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,710
will not only stalls emerge on says

511
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:13,600
and the having event so when the data
turned out to be in public access

512
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,750
after they now I'm nafta hey king also
more mild cell phone so

513
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:23,220
or email him that's impossible within
their the legislation does not provide

514
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,710
the wherewithal for

515
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:30,280
bringing see perpetrators to justice
expose

516
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,620
security events sir now

517
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:37,830
over the last 12 months hit in the head
sets of three years ago we were talking

518
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,430
about that

519
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:42,320
a vulnerability is a fun a value of
public data

520
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,560
or actually cause that kind of am are

521
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,930
or disrespect and after

522
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:55,290
the a snow them Keiser you know snowden
helped us it has become

523
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:59,780
a very important I remember he helped me
personally know so a

524
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:03,970
at a similar information for my a
similar discussion I was so

525
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:07,020
telling you that Google analyzes the
personal

526
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:12,120
our correspondents of users and a there
was a Google representative and Senator

527
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,660
hope who came up and said it so I am the
same day

528
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:19,420
in guardian that the first to snow
dinner her

529
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:24,480
a open save reveal secrets appeared to
so that's the first week

530
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,879
wafer

531
00:32:25,879 --> 00:32:29,610
there over the last year I would like to
mention two events s

532
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:34,200
so first a meeting

533
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,769
on their the Russian segment of the
Internet to security

534
00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:44,519
unfortunately as a result some

535
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:48,129
kept classified but once after the

536
00:32:48,129 --> 00:32:52,989
Security Council the minister did not
came up with the claim that we're

537
00:32:52,989 --> 00:32:58,460
ready to to combat manuscript so it's
another way to

538
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:02,070
this to admit that as a way to go and

539
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:07,850
there are many things to to work on that
means we have to protect the vital

540
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:10,480
interests of the state test security

541
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,230
and an individual user

542
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:18,359
in the information environment and
another inventor

543
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:22,539
as that term rates the importance of
sicko for information security is

544
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:23,200
partial

545
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,379
restriction of functionality of a
product depending on the

546
00:33:27,379 --> 00:33:30,769
location geography so differently women
the Crimea

547
00:33:30,769 --> 00:33:34,980
firstly and a ball across Coast region
moscow

548
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:39,359
you know was a failure so some servicers

549
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:44,009
has become unavailable for the local
residents are

550
00:33:44,009 --> 00:33:47,539
sir a breakthrough in now see

551
00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:50,820
mentality is so

552
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:55,330
some people have been quite cosmopolitan
thought those that they're all people

553
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:57,389
are good and we show the best time but

554
00:33:57,389 --> 00:34:01,739
and a this multi stakeholder

555
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:05,220
model when you never know who makes the
decision

556
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:10,389
actually raises dots all i's and cross
all to you so that now they started to

557
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:11,510
sink a different way

558
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:14,780
now the admit to have vulnerabilities

559
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:18,970
in there we have a router so with

560
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:22,540
with bags and packs and that this
discourse urged

561
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:27,480
this change of their router allows us to
cope with that we shall have

562
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,510
for from changes in the legislation

563
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:34,230
upcoming changes and s experts are you

564
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:37,550
going to do things

565
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:41,960
more things and so and do it means that
the population

566
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:47,010
is some becoming more educated here some
fortunately we're learning from our own

567
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:47,850
mistakes some

568
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:53,409
we would like to do otherwise but so I
so hope is there a

569
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:56,960
many more regions in moscow that to has
suffered

570
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,240
no I'm so what are we

571
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,609
going to do I enjoy in May many of my
colleagues a

572
00:35:03,609 --> 00:35:07,200
and you know in the security council

573
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,000
as a new security doc doctrine is being
developed

574
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,300
so are the threats are approximately the
same as they had been a

575
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:20,970
in the early 2000's so imperceptibly
tution block has been a

576
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:24,530
absolutely them sent down the drain
because of this

577
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:28,330
threats have been described the and

578
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:32,160
in the year two thousand week with the
launch our own now

579
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,880
payment system we have dirt cheap cards
and things like that without the new

580
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,990
at magnetic stripe with them so at the
level of the deputy

581
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:45,590
and director of the center bank we had
representatives so far other payment

582
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,340
systems and probably that's why

583
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:52,300
the system as the systems have been stop
maybe is a business law bid to

584
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:58,210
you know well archaeologists are not
politicians so I don't want to go back

585
00:35:58,210 --> 00:35:59,900
it's most important that the

586
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,020
we do not repeat such mistakes in the
future

587
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:06,119
so the doctrine on the information
security

588
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:11,619
I hope you're well be finally published
by 2015 then it's going to be

589
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:15,580
and new concept to the information
security

590
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:19,850
and

591
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:22,560
so

592
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,060
said complain I wanted to

593
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:29,020
elucidative just like my colleagues from
that text us

594
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,230
department to said that it's only three

595
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:35,900
the in this cyberspace a the strongest

596
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:39,600
if is the one who sets the rules

597
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,690
and there are no rules so far and

598
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:46,200
there are companies mmm

599
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,610
who are was a leaders on probably

600
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:53,570
there should be some kind of harness as
tax eso

601
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:56,950
the opportunity to find them because in
Europe from

602
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:59,990
my in Google Louis

603
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:04,220
when you enter site input to the the
inquiry

604
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:09,950
though there is a special warning for
the provision of information for you

605
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:11,910
about something that does not I'm

606
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:16,290
match so I as far as I know the russians
user sir

607
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:22,220
do not have for a chance to do so less
than one percent

608
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:25,450
just to

609
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:28,540
but round in the UK this system is
different

610
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:33,050
and you know there are restrictions for
authorized to users and to

611
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:38,530
once you have not confirmed your Etienne
and the your such as such and you want

612
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,570
to visit to

613
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:42,590
this specific website you will not have

614
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,690
access and army a and

615
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:49,510
something is unavailable now so

616
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:55,500
I do minder such strict regulation

617
00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:00,050
battered differently we need a dialogue
with the company's and they've Google

618
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:06,480
is afraid to to restrict their turnovers
so we still have for

619
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,810
to have some restrictions set some
regulation of our cyberspace and

620
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:15,310
yesterday I sent a.m. an inquiry to ross
comrades or

621
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:20,160
to general tourneys Office minister for
economic development and I found out

622
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,640
and there are people here in the room
who sent me some

623
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:30,220
analytics that it served as a minister
of economic underdevelopment

624
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:33,390
that recommended the Google Analytic
Services

625
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:36,520
so almost all the state government
website

626
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,260
so Google Analytics columns the
information about the users and

627
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,180
everything

628
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:44,210
from are

629
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:48,500
to do with it so even the mouse clicks
and send it to a remote

630
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:54,140
server can imagine we sent him to the
information about our citizens and in

631
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,930
response so they provide us some

632
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:59,730
analytics I believe this situation is
not very

633
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:03,920
nice and Ross Commons or should I look
into it and the protect the personal

634
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,550
data

635
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:09,180
especially for the texture inspection so
unfortunately there are no

636
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:13,240
Russian counters but im Yandex metric
system Russian

637
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,760
no spy locker guess in Amsterdam

638
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,270
I believe that it's here that weekend
the set up a group

639
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:23,390
their turn wilmer

640
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:27,460
visited develop we need to develop

641
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:31,570
so let me tell you a brief joke just to
finalize

642
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:35,100
our conversation so in there that
mountain villages

643
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,770
people trying to cover a gapper a

644
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:44,190
through a real narrow pass on their
freedom local so just to you know we're

645
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,200
that that they

646
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,960
gary is a tourist so for money to
another site in one day

647
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:55,030
a strong local guy are seeing many many
it was decided to raise his efficiency

648
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:59,130
and you talk to people under his arm
Peter took out one

649
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:03,000
on his neck and this was going there'll
percent and carries them

650
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,170
I'm know through the gap so

651
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:11,930
when he was hot way for he just dropped
one of them because he got tired I say

652
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:12,510
our

653
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,980
to to how was that troop also I will
carry only two

654
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:19,870
and dropped out one of the three guys he
was caring

655
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:26,480
a2z to the Abbess so we have another
customer representative from the same

656
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,780
committee and rate them on out for us so

657
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:31,990
yes the menu fans at the college forgot
to say

658
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:36,650
we would you like to add yeah what what
is there to add

659
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:43,000
recent half a year ago this state do
mine in the state someone tried to hack

660
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,040
and ATM mmm when I

661
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:53,190
try to tell soul people approve you know
you've got your cyber criminals

662
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:57,860
in the and the Nano it was just you know

663
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:02,600
physical they tried to use a hammer a 80
to break it to its not packing

664
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,670
is just breaking into it a soda as
simple burglary

665
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:10,050
so after analyzing you know this case

666
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:13,160
the the security in

667
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:18,390
services said decided to raise so their
knowledge in the information policy

668
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:22,300
otherwise anyone can take a hammer and a

669
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,820
minor or a screwdriver and a

670
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:30,500
break until the ATM so sometimes we
share just a good cop

671
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,930
and the bad cop by team is a bad cop and
I'm a good cop

672
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:38,440
I am Z is a good cop I always disagree
with him

673
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:43,780
and he keeps disagree arguing with me so
is there anyone here who would like to

674
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,600
to to sugarcoat the pill

675
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:50,170
know that that's good because Sam we
have always come up with our

676
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:53,340
contradictions and US professional
community can

677
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:57,300
judge what's right what's wrong and find
their

678
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:01,270
with the the all too much truth that
where searching for

679
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:04,650
I believe that occur when now

680
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:07,850
are there is an app complicated issue

681
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:11,500
ahead of us people trying to simplify it

682
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,740
Eve a an issue simple

683
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:19,760
people try to complicated so you don't
need to simplify

684
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,100
a complicated issue

685
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:26,370
an enigma because we shall not get the
proper result

686
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:29,440
so each solution should def

687
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,830
deal with the goal should

688
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:36,700
dusts be streamlined should be is the
way the goal requires and the

689
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:40,130
due Monday pitches and their profile
ministry people you know

690
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:44,280
unfortunately we cannot see them here
that I P D

691
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:48,040
we were inviting them we we had invited
them but

692
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,380
we are not professionals like PU

693
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:56,200
we he it's you who are you know geeks
and nerds you you leave that life you

694
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,310
know you swim you know how to swim in
that see

695
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:00,440
in that C

696
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,060
and we all have our mission

697
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:08,670
to achieve for the Ministry the well

698
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:12,319
should develop the draft more sir

699
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:15,859
that will go them for do my approval but

700
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:20,540
it's you should provide the content for
the draft laws

701
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:24,890
their professional community guys you
understand the

702
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:28,670
was it tricks they don't see profession
so

703
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:32,980
and then when we pass it and the state
dumas when we have a roundtable

704
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:33,810
discussion

705
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:36,859
with one hundred people I love them
ninety

706
00:43:36,859 --> 00:43:39,770
a a

707
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:42,730
here about the issue for the first time
in their life

708
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:46,770
it sounds funny it looks weird you know
so

709
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:49,900
criticize us keep criticizing us

710
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:53,010
keep doing that in the web but all

711
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:57,310
for their ways out the offer your
solutions if you just criticize but

712
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:58,310
don't offer

713
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:01,730
don't suggest what to do and director

714
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:05,350
see activity in their right to on that
way so

715
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:09,500
it means that you want to do nothing
that's offend you

716
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:12,730
to blame you are to blame so we

717
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:16,390
invite you when we have this draft law

718
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:21,330
on information security we encourage you
we prevail upon hugh

719
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:25,260
to participate in the discussion in the
monitoring please speak up

720
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:28,940
because whatever you say in the Internet
you know

721
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:32,400
make sure we hear it in the stadium I
suggest we don't

722
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,330
in there we have Alex a local ski here
let's put him there might come to ask

723
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:37,770
him

724
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:41,310
to express

725
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:45,150
his point of view and definitely

726
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:48,430
no I'm not going to criticize you

727
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:53,890
I i understand pretty well that was a
number of 16 regulators and the security

728
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:54,460
of the main

729
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:59,100
issues mom that they are right but they
they they cannot agree among themselves

730
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:02,420
we don't have a single concept of
development

731
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:07,109
on the information security legislation
so sometimes a

732
00:45:07,109 --> 00:45:11,290
it boils down to total the fact you know
when they have

733
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:15,270
absolutely contradicting draft laws in
different comida so

734
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:18,570
my curve this data security use torture

735
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:21,800
are overseas a mmm and their

736
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,580
now we can keep the personal data only

737
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:29,770
inside russia but the other wall
provides that we have to keep them

738
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:33,350
beyond the back Russian boundaries says
so and other issue

739
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:36,800
that we don't have a firm

740
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,990
common terminology two years ago

741
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:42,270
in the car so a federation we

742
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:47,400
you were discussing the first project to
are the cybersecurity

743
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,850
and that has been dropped sold

744
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:55,190
know we were arguing if with clinton you
said this term cyber security

745
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:56,100
considering

746
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,400
VIN number of meetings that we had you
know we

747
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,640
it took us half a year that this term

748
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,580
cannot be used in russia because it has
been introduced by

749
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:09,730
arrivals the United States and Russia

750
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:15,610
should use another term information
security not cybersecurity so

751
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:18,820
but finally we have more Harper

752
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:25,340
discussed that some important issues and
this topic was dropped a so they won so

753
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:31,280
whole initiated this so discussion sup
left to these counselor Federation

754
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,930
a.m. does the idea died a natural death

755
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:38,510
for sale but as there were other items
like a

756
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:42,930
white hackers have called an hour says
support of local companies who

757
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:46,290
perform such works and now we

758
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:50,590
I see is a new doc tree in the emerging
and I will disagree to my costume up

759
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:51,120
Aleks

760
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:55,450
who say just common criticize we would
be happy to come but we don't know where

761
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:56,820
there's no place to come to

762
00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:00,430
on Prince dancer

763
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:05,360
in some website it says there is an
opportunity to

764
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,970
to are express your opinion better

765
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:13,190
as for the state do my if you want to
come up with an idea how to write an

766
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:15,290
offer understand it has been a

767
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:18,770
a considered

768
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:23,250
is absolutely murky so there is no
interruption there is no way to interact

769
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:26,910
and the third a issue is we have very
slow so easy

770
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:30,570
would take the security of critical
infrastructure it has been

771
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:37,110
drafted in August 2013 so two years have
elapsed and the drop floor has not even

772
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:38,490
left does the government

773
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:42,780
so a it took already two years to
discuss

774
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:48,840
and a no too many incidents that
happened over those two years a while as

775
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,540
a lot more has not been passed

776
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:53,940
so we cannot coordinate our activities

777
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:57,089
hence we have these issues with
legislation

778
00:47:57,089 --> 00:48:02,970
and teal we have a real an accident or
emergency case nothing

779
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:06,880
is going to no so no that's you know

780
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:12,300
how we are going to stop the experts

781
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,130

782
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:17,150
but let me make to announce where you

country how to have kar

789
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:39,140

791
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:47,020
session and leave some to this story

792
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:50,710
or with our presentations so

793
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:55,300
no I'm opening the 44 questions I

794
00:48:55,300 --> 00:49:06,340
a scene no hands yes I C one hand

795
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:11,160
hello thank you for the interesting take
on the topic I would like our to ask you

796
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,310
about their anonymous and network so

797
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:17,620
know which is now the foundation of the
black market on services

798
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:36,460
in the country home or are you going to
try to regulate it

799
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:41,190
cells estate boom is going to man as far
as in

800
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:45,170
and and no

801
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:48,410
that is going we're going to pass a war
about

802
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:52,700
permissions not ban says so we're still
talking about we should we should

803
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,460
understand that this is there is some

804
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:58,740
toxic information I dunno but I get I

805
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:04,359
I get ballistic when you know there is
some service to the forum so you know

806
00:50:04,359 --> 00:50:07,650
you you it they they distribute children
kids pornography

807
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:11,750
so how to make drugs cheaper and quicker
you have things like that

808
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:17,319
on to you there is no solution we all
understand that something has to be done

809
00:50:17,319 --> 00:50:18,230
with this system

810
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:21,410
and we understand that probably for
their colleagues and a

811
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:24,460
I hope that for the interior

812
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:28,880
ministry this network is anonymous but
there are people behind it

813
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,450
who can always find the link send the
find the people behind it

814
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:36,890
so its unacceptable

815
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:40,089
these ways to distribute information are

816
00:50:40,089 --> 00:50:43,359
on acceptable and the it has to be

817
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:50,469
in the here

818
00:50:50,469 --> 00:50:53,709
you my name is Andrey my question

819
00:50:53,709 --> 00:50:58,349
so we understand we're leaving through

820
00:50:58,349 --> 00:51:02,869
strange times and we are trying to make
steps and that we now

821
00:51:02,869 --> 00:51:06,280
have for the I'm

822
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:10,000
a law on automated system says so we are
now

823
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,350
working on their and or they're all the
defense minister boat so

824
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:17,370
farm we have no laws

825
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:22,760
about cybersecurity I'm arm

826
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:26,280
violations says so its up to my process

827
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:30,000
to make the decisions we have some less
assess that

828
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,750
the are quite to that contain quite
murky

829
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:36,990
requirements awesome security the
questions when will

830
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:41,030
but this state control the security

831
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:45,290
I issues all such private companies

832
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:48,530
who I'll are

833
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:52,880
well out outsourcing you know for the
defence ministry

834
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,880
I would like to have him some standards
security requirements for some companies

835
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:58,290
said

836
00:51:58,290 --> 00:52:03,550
because so until

837
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:07,050
the city documents are made classified
it can

838
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:12,490
easily be made public so before the
documents are classified

839
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:15,840
they have for a wonderful chance to be
distributed so

840
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:19,730
a hookah that text are still more

841
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:25,160
it contains a their requirements 20
organizations serve their

842
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:29,140
to now provide don't services sir
Tuesday

843
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:34,430
critical infrastructures till survey
arranges

844
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:39,170
very wide to

845
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:42,740
and that goes beyond to the list of 2005
for

846
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:46,060
it kenna contain many um

847
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:50,690
companies and area said and then the
question is about compliance and

848
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:51,500
enforcement

849
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,910
so the question is not in there

850
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:58,990
lack about the lack of requirements but
I would say about the control and

851
00:52:58,990 --> 00:52:59,910
monitoring

852
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,930
of the organization serves their

853
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:06,119
to apply for their licenses for specific
jobs

854
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:12,550
%um from yeah speaking there about being
direction with the committee

855
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:17,200
quarter please sir preparing your
proposal so we

856
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,660
shall exchange our contacts and

857
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:25,170
them probably arrange a roundtable on
this topic and what about the

858
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:25,820
controlling

859
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:29,369
agencies do they have the requirement
for instance

860
00:53:29,369 --> 00:53:32,410
baybay according to them

861
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:35,609
you know

862
00:53:35,609 --> 00:53:40,859
this checker is going to be as Vegas
says the requirements no ministry has

863
00:53:40,859 --> 00:53:44,820
everything in this respect so we should
only

864
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:48,160
I'll uses the required yes yes

865
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:53,000
their primary their prevalent you should
use their requirements out for

866
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:11,530
to coordinate your activities you have
to comply

867
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:15,130
pity on them from gas from one form the
question to everyone

868
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:18,480
about us storing the personal data why

869
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,660
con tu you create some international co
from them and

870
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:26,550
develop some international convention
about this talks torture or for personal

871
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:27,530
data

872
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:31,930
in russia and a Russian personal data

873
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:35,320
in other countries

874
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:38,620
a.m. the foreign personal data in russia
thank you for the question

875
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:42,480
so I believe we have been talking about
it today

876
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,550
and the the question the writing is on
the wall why

877
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:49,890
we shell never

878
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:54,360
even discuss such conventions there's a
number of countries

879
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:59,550
who will never want to store their
personal

880
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:03,100
data over russians in Russia

881
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:06,250
so some countries are interested

882
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:10,370
to to store the Russian personal data

883
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:13,700
a.m. to their citizens personal data in
their country

884
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:16,860
so I guess we have to stop my a.m.

885
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:21,260
the up not atticus Pierce Co here will
