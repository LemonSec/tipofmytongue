1
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,899
speak about SEP meanwhile

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:11,360
SEP security and attacks on SEP
meanwhile

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,929
this is dumping opposition woke up
coupled cells couple was about myself

4
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:15,179
I'm

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,060
a IT security a especially Steve Aoki's
come

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,310
by researcher be systems been

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,450
a what a deal your PSEB and web
application security

8
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:33,500
publications research our company your
piece can is involved in the research

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,510
of ERP systems security of the OP
systems

10
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,470
we'll working more we have more than
between

11
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,010
more than 60 conferences all over the
world was because them and by the number

12
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,650
of the ability to discover

13
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,460
in the products of CB wat leader

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,180
from for you and today

15
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:00,810
my presentation I have divided into
three main parts: in the first five

16
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:05,409
we learned about CPE about platform to
learn about its main components which

17
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:07,560
components do exist how did the function

18
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,570
and how they correlate to each other
this second part

19
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,979
will be dick in a2

20
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:19,470
SE people the platform liabilities that
were discovered

21
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:25,380
I'll tell you why did you work in this
direction said how can we fix them

22
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,170
and in the third far Apple tell you some
conclusions

23
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:35,299
and will look at what is to be done

24
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:39,310
in order to minimize the threat

25
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,510
Eve the attack happen against your

26
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:47,550
seeking about system city

27
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,730
while is a platform which

28
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:54,790
has proximity to public structure

29
00:01:54,790 --> 00:02:00,120
it can be divided into three main
components: the first component

30
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,480
is a public network in the public
network we have all the devices

31
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,940
bleach can be brought to work by the
police or the company

32
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,960
which are used to and which can

33
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,510
get certain information have thrown the

34
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,150
SAP system in which they work in a
company

35
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:32,030
and which information the

36
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,050
get connected by their devices to

37
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,530
seeking well platform which is already
inside the corporate network

38
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:44,220
eight consists of two plots is a sub
seeking a buyer services him about serve

39
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:44,670
her

40
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,050
is a quarter all the sitcom about a
block for

41
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,870
and its second part is a customer
database which contains

42
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:56,150
all the information about SAP platform
eat

43
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:02,959
has information about devices which can
get connected today city platform

44
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,209
has the information about the user's

45
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:10,980
et cetera and 8.5 his bag and where

46
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,520
the services are the kids

47
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,860
all these ERP systems is the bag

48
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,310
and and seeking about platform gets the
information

49
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:28,840
from devices respectively analyzes we
should this information from the back

50
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,070
and should be bald

51
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:36,860
and transfer to the client devices

52
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,020
it has for long

53
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,380
versions the right now we are going to
look at 2.3 and three

54
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:46,550
all as you can see with increasing
diversions

55
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:50,880
with the development sitting by platform
with CD higher number of particles been

56
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,760
supporters

57
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,550
and you can see which protocol

58
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,930
on which level does it work one

59
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:03,420
level pointed out like a safari

60
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,090
I love we are not going to speak about
it today bob afterwards

61
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,240
we are go to tell you

62
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,680
separately in a separate presentation
for

63
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,830
we are going to tell about security
about of

64
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:22,480
a safari CB FRS

65
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,110
well as he could rattle consists of
three main services which

66
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:31,050
on city control center is a control
center represents

67
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:36,270
portal which

68
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:40,450
is being used by that mean to control
City mobile platform

69
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,590
the working

70
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:48,940
process is as she sees service which has
four main ports

71
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,650
2100 L 4 9's

72
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,710
are used inside all these processes

73
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,280
and 4 8282 8283

74
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,580
he's used for connections between

75
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,430
is said to be protocol issue product and
transfer this information to the poor

76
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,390
and I would like to say that

77
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:14,280
8282 work uses by default 82 people
worked

78
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,180
which redirects the course to https
which is located

79
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:23,440
on the porch 82-83 second

80
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,020
service SEP SQL anywhere CBS crew

81
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,250
anywhere is a database which

82
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,310
worse developed

83
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:39,380
in nineteen nineties and India 2006 when

84
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,240
they have implemented overall the main
components

85
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,570
and services

86
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:51,400
of parallel process seeing

87
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,540
highly lauded services they have started

88
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:00,180
developing aids more a widely and they
started

89
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,260
using it in a wider set of products and
when they have

90
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:09,660
procured sybase company India 2010

91
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,680
they started a SAP anywhere

92
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,070
and they started integrating all these
into their drugs

93
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:20,440
City mobile platforms you can use not
only SEP SQL Anywhere database but you

94
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,270
can also use

95
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:26,700
Oracle database as well and MSSQL as
well SEP Israeli border

96
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,410
is a very flexible database way a cheese

97
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:36,120
which uses big number connectors in

98
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,650
other programming languages and you can
easy to get connected to these data base

99
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,770
with different languages

100
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:45,570
and you can get data

101
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,730
which you need for example in long

102
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:52,090
general working condition it listens to
3

103
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:57,530
main processes which are responsible
mostly for data processing

104
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,900
the third services

105
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,370
seeking both server seeking about server
represents

106
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:10,180
six main services but today we're going
to look

107
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,650
actual the link in a bit web service

108
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:17,900
this is it core of them about SEP
platform which is responsible for

109
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,170
processing

110
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:24,420
requests which %uh calming role mmm the
portable devices

111
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,530
multi-link

112
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,610
is a process is a software which is
responsible for sinking

113
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,980
data between server

114
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:40,580
and cried decline

115
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,009
can get connected to the server to the
internet with the use age

116
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:49,129
of always protocols listed here and

117
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:52,129
join the connection sinking is happening

118
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:56,060
between the dummies all the client and
server database

119
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:00,780
and the second service that we're going
to look at

120
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:10,830
is at mean websites admin webservice
uses

121
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,789
cassini web server 1.0 all and

122
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:16,969
it needs it so that mean in from the
locals

123
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:22,650
but would be able to control SEP
biosimilar

124
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:28,020
so he can use methods listed here

125
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,139
bill or a job creator administrator

126
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:34,560
its create users removed

127
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,010
email it's a trap top let's warm

128
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:41,820
and let's look at vulnerabilities that
were discovered by this

129
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,120
during all research first

130
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,220
on is

131
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,540
quitting all the seeking a bow platform
goip

132
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,000
joop product general

133
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,459
protocol is used by the process Mobilink
it ordered to

134
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:04,100
administrator opens the console gets
connected to the seeking about platform

135
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,220
to control

136
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,370
packages which

137
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:12,149
or which can be a removed two

138
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:16,610
on the SAP mobile platform but that mean
he can also look

139
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:21,350
at legs that were generated

140
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,430
endless even

141
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,980
information about the general condition
%uh SAP mobile platforms such

142
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:33,519
when he gets connected to the console

143
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,079
to seeking about platform he sans

144
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:43,579
requests which looks like that and you
can see here that

145
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:47,449
in this request he transfers sudden
information

146
00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:50,779
which fields have the name user

147
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:58,410
and pass L in a book called

148
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,649
I have shown the information bleach it
can be

149
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:07,560
the name of the user

150
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,500
login and the password for the user of
course it's not possible to cede in an

151
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,459
open way because

152
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:15,820
eights be in the closed

153
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,029
and it's been created but we have found
the function which is responsible for

154
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:24,500
description of these data then we have
developed a software and was able to

155
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,209
program

156
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:29,910
Andy if you will able to let your it
doesn't require

157
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,260
very tough all greatly of calling it
uses

158
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:38,010
only shift she

159
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:42,310
the augite of shootings being used here
so we have developed

160
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,500
a soft program which

161
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,899
gets at the inn but the said in creating
encrypt the data

162
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:52,779
and as a consequence the outboard it
gives us

163
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:56,010
leading and password that were
transferred

164
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:04,550
through the door transferred by the
administrator the server in order to get

165
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,160
the connection

166
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:10,149
let's remember this program because

167
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:13,800
afterwards we will also used

168
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,620
this second the ability that was
discovered its

169
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:21,519
XP in the seeking a platform XP

170
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,440
represents a little bit see it which is
related to injection

171
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,720
on the channel external entities into
XML

172
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,220
and

173
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,699
role processing and the server side of
those the vulnerability the

174
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:40,410
has received these particular CE that
issue

175
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:43,690
2013 2013 and CP portal

176
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:47,699
I would surely to you eat has a such

177
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:51,260
interface its

178
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:55,949
development ActionScript but usage of a
lot less clear

179
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:58,350
capabilities

180
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,269
during the duration of the trial which
is yours yet you will be able to see any

181
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:03,410
other references

182
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:12,420
and links but in order to CEO

183
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,130
which honor links and Urals used in the
portal that you see

184
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:19,250
we decided to look for trials which

185
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:27,000
crude have which

186
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,610
good

187
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:31,680
information which would be interesting
for the

188
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,050
Hauge well two files which called

189
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,920
web XML and says come pick X amount we
decided to look for them

190
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,570
and with found one of these files which
is located on this particular

191
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,920
pathway and we know that and the CPM
about a block from

192
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,959
2.3 version uses computer for servlets

193
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:55,040
which are Java based jetty so weak

194
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,750
discovered this Excel file which
contains these particular record and you

195
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,790
can see that

196
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:04,140
eat has the Message Broker serb-led

197
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,980
whose address is not completely
specified

198
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,279
so we don't know lemme

199
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,890
how can we open this but you should let
and see which

200
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:23,000
requests 8 reach receives and processes
then we have decided to search for files

201
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,920
outweigh the name says convict X we have
discovered this file

202
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,930
which contains this particular record

203
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:35,339
and this is a structure this record and
it describes

204
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:38,600
the name of the server the board

205
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:45,329
and a full bar way to this particular
subject there

206
00:13:45,329 --> 00:13:48,340
in the same structure

207
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,700
you can see it Java

208
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,750
the pathway to the jungle I which
processes

209
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:58,040
these request sent

210
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,850
to this particular subject so the
further research

211
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,870
against the possibility to discover that
this java file

212
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:09,240
uses XML parser which

213
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,440
received

214
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,130
XML document and processes it by the
processing

215
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:20,480
is happening in the roadway also like to
tell you that nexus between seven

216
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,980
there were five more others let's access
to which

217
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,110
is anonymous so we have send

218
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,640
request the following composition

219
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,970
with it injection diesel entity

220
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:38,330
which spice to the server that

221
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:44,500
it needs to on the half with this server

222
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:51,310
send the request for this particular
address and after

223
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:55,490
sending we have the so that server is
available to xx key

224
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:59,670
attack aids improperly processes these
requests

225
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:03,460
xx he gives you a possibility to that
doctor

226
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:07,300
in some cases to read files

227
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,400
scan into reports and some

228
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,570
lives download files to server

229
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:18,370
so we were able to

230
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:22,670
read one of those files look at in this
particular partly

231
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:26,290
and the I can tell me in advance that

232
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,690
in particular but both from it contains
a lot of files which

233
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:35,560
have confidential information passwords
logins

234
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,550
and many all other

235
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:42,790
informations

236
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:47,460
so in the Swan it contains the
information about

237
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:51,450
key which is called Sepe more BB

238
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,710
I'll or you P it's a kind of

239
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:58,089
in Creek did data sudden trip to deter

240
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:01,960
which causes include

241
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,400
but with the usage up program which

242
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:10,339
G creates the data

243
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:13,780
transferred by Jori protocol we're able
to create

244
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:17,170
these data and as a result we have
received

245
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:20,980
a system login and password system

246
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,430
in ordered to

247
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:29,100
fakes this from ability well the next
seven beginning

248
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,050
this for their ability related to
chalice tacking

249
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:36,450
SAP system we also have been

250
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:42,160
telling and a black hat USA Inc 2011 you
can download it from the internet

251
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,730
watch it

252
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:48,839
in this presentation we've been telling
about surveillance

253
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,570
which can be described in web.xml files

254
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:57,750
which allocated miss her also detailed
information well I cannot disclose it to

255
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,430
your bucket list

256
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:02,949
where phone another servlet which is
responsible for generations old logs

257
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:07,589
and their reedy access to which is also
known as:

258
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:12,010
so the attacker can send a lot of
requests to the server

259
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:16,110
which will generate join each week West

260
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:19,540
server will generate separate block file
with the nickname

261
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:23,260
in other words attacker can send a lot
of files

262
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,970
by these he can a overload discovers
memory

263
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:30,200
something about summer in

264
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,179
order to take this availability ASAP
every commands to install

265
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:38,320
note

266
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,790
which is specified here about the next

267

mobile platform 3 Aldred process while
this is

270
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,710
mean conscripts all and it is

271
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:04,200
simply very flexible

272
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,120

275
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:19,530
platform he can get logs he can at
repositories

276
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:25,320
which have applications that he could
use in the future

277
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,480
he can create administrators he can
remove

278
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,470
logs centuries said so we have
discovered

279
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:40,049
as his era the garbage which gives a
possibility

280
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:43,470

advance that she will follow this link

283
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,300

286
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:05,230
but in this trader these Johns Creek

287
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,610
request to CPM by a platform

288
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,660
the following

289
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:15,720
content has been sent so it's a pathway
all the way to

290
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,730
serb-led which

291
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:23,250
processes these requests and POST
request which

292
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,760
as username and password to create

293
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,350
the administrator and thus for usually
it's these

294
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,020
she s forever attack and he can create
administrator

295
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,210
as afterwards the attacker can

296
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:41,320
use these adminstrator addition ATT's
own purposes

297
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,050
in order to get to enter the portal to
remove these logs

298
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,350
Anders also some on requests bleach

299
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:52,380
are subject to CSRF attack

300
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,860
the attacker can create repository

301
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,170
remove server logs create

302
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:03,930
applications SEP by platform and the

303
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:07,120
do many other things so

304
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:14,420
CSRF token is not presently a so that is
he the company

305
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:21,060
request to install CP in old the
following a deep

306
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:27,290
to fakes these particular vulnerability

307
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:32,610
City mobile platform also uses cassini

308
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:36,679
while all which is a web server it's a
very simple web server

309
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:41,919
cassini

310
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,490
does not support any

311
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:50,470
notification does not support https
traffic it listens to local port and

312
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,360
processes

313
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:58,610
requests to study pages it also doesn't
have

314
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:02,850
any issue as a ref talking it's a
request to create administrator

315
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:07,290
so the attacker can calls to make a
simple CSRF

316
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:10,940
attack but with one precondition that
male meanwhile

317
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,429
and tear the page which sense

318
00:21:14,429 --> 00:21:22,840
these particular requests from this
developers have could see me

319
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,470
they do warn

320
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:30,220
away CPU's it they weren't

321
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,799
dad cassini server one all can not be
used because

322
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:44,240
aids subject to these

323
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,410
attacks and doesn't have any security
modules

324
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:54,480

00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,790
remove users and remove certain

329

00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:16,050
CSRF attack you can realize all these
methods

331

care have significant damage

334
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:32,730
next vulnerability

335
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:37,210
is related to diabetes and that we have
used

336
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:40,850
in case we have used in our village the

337
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:44,059
ball for overflow in CBS kill

338
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:51,350
anywhere in year 2000 8

339
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:55,700
and any other doesn't 40 web discovered
some Miller villages in this platform

340
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:00,320
in these particular database also

341
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,490
the villages have been related to that
befor overflow

342
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:07,090
boof our research

343
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:12,690
west on it by taking

344
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:16,530
Klein part of this killing were in the
central part and we've tried to create

345
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,710
connection

346
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:26,830
clients have a connection with but as
you can see from here

347
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:31,750
we have installed a connection and we
see the data being transferred from so

348
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,640
much blind in

349
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,630
backwards sold it to the first request
which transfers

350
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:42,070
information about logging

351
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:45,850

getting these connections

353
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:54,280
these request has the following content

354
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:58,050
the first bites are responsible for

355
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:01,630
version been used as had a client

356
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:05,750
for example in these cases its SQL

357
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:10,050
anywhere version 16 I'm second picture

358
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:15,130
you can see the field which

359
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:20,520
is responsible for the name

360
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,830
of protocol that's gonna be used his DS
protocol

361
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:27,120
TS political and getting close the data

362
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,410
that's going to be transferred and in
the end you can see the name on this

363
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,240
server

364
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:36,440
to which we

365
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,780
initialized connection this search

366
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,340
shoulders that after sending is

367
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,730
request which represents to

368
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:53,370
connection streaks during

369
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:57,050
sending this request September the
process Saini

370
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:01,110
because 5820 fifty-year

371
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:04,570
21 the SQL service you can see

372
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:07,670
disconnection of services which word for
all

373
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:11,100
the system account so in other words
it's a

374
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,850
the US of CPS go anywhere

375
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:18,930
and Lord device can be

376
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:22,830
initialized with the SAP platform is CBN
were platform

377
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:26,030
sold system SP anywhere platform

378
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:29,260
is non-functioning it stops it holds

379
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:32,610
swim all the tools started administrator
should

380
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:35,710
enter this server should fall on these
two services

381
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:39,540
hem shoot enable them

382
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,490
in order

383
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:47,700
to face this vulnerability one should
installed these particular SEP no

384
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,830
these eighty 21 08

385
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:55,510
161 we have looked at the liabilities
related to this service

386
00:25:55,510 --> 00:26:00,200
side so the router that was discovered
by a cynic line site

387
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:06,730
speak about seeking well platform

388
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:11,330
blind software which is used for this EP
mobile platform can be downloaded from

389
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:15,710
available stores like a wet cloth market

390
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:21,210
Apple store windows form large all these

391
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:24,210
clients can be downloaded free of charge

392
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:28,040
and in case we have looked art SEPM

393
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,070
wired a represents

394
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:34,440
software program which is used

395
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:41,200
in medical facilities to enable

396
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,670
employees sheesh on this medical
facility to quickly communicate with

397
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,160
each other

398
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,690
to transfer some confidential
information in

399
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:54,270
water to be able to look at some

400
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:58,810
patients cars and some related
information for the unlimited

401
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:02,620
was discarded it wasn't SQL injection
vulnerability

402
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:06,970
it was a possibility of problems

403
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:10,920
installed on Android turned to the sete

404
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:18,820
your mer unwired program to send

405
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:22,260
vulnerable a request to the content
providing content provider

406
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,380
it's a pods of on Troy's

407
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:35,890
from which is responsible for

408
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:39,610
responsible for communication between
applications

409
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:43,610
one application a to the content
provider can get data from

410
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:47,150
modification and in case

411
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:51,190
checker in anyway

412
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:54,340
has made an employee all medical
facility

413
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:58,210
in case has made to install this program
which

414
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:02,830
sans request to acquire data from
content provider

415
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:05,860
of SEP Mr unwired

416
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:12,470
and the

417
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:18,429
program home the by later can get the
data from the database at least

418
00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:23,510
software so volatile contain the local
content providers are know that

419
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:31,290
on these slide the only thing that one
needs

420
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:34,350
to make this attack the attacker needs

421
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:38,160
for these program to have an Android
manifest

422
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:43,640
this particular file which

423
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,340
has information but which occasion has
which extensions in

424
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:52,290
order to a vitalize this record which
will permit to the attackers

425
00:28:52,290 --> 00:29:00,150
software to get access to these
particular in order to fix

426
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:04,180
fix it its recommended to install this
particular SEP known

427
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,530
1864 she's 21 paid

428
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:10,770
want to switch on the update the
software

429
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:14,330
and it will additionally download these

430
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:18,920
so let's to a certain conclusions

431
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:23,380
at a everything offset order to prevent

432
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:26,470
decks against seeking by platform it is

433
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:31,110
recommended to install all the North on
a timely basis CB screeching noise which

434
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,810
abolished by the PCB company

435
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:36,430
a timely basis properly set SEP platform

436
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:40,450
so in other words regular

437
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:46,090
police shoes be prohibited to get axes

438
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:50,420
to the administration portal very often

439
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:54,220
happens that when you speak to them
administrators the city

440
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:57,380
so watch they can have access but he
does

441
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,730
longing and password to enter the system

442
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:04,870
administration but as I were able to
show them

443
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:08,860
Haas said let's which don't require a
knee

444
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:12,970
notification

445
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:16,610
so you can call them anonymously you can
read files server

446
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:19,690
good and for

447
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:25,430
get all the necessary confidential
information

448
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:29,040
the second thing which is to be done is
to periodically

449
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:34,980
backup logs from saucer

450
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,220
third

451
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:41,640
is to divide roles between

452
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,020
administrators if there's love them so
you shouldn't give

453
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:50,380
all that means traders access to the
file system

454
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:56,400
and to the board well its ability to
change the promise of

455
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,410
administrator good easily ETS

456
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:05,180
bought these access to the file system
into the problem hinges the program

457
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:11,630
whose changes will be reflected in laws
then she can go into the filesystem

458
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:12,920
remove those logs

459
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,000
and then change the problem by standard

460
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,120
and at the scene period of time

461
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,350
he's program that he installs we'll make

462
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:28,810
said negative functions

463
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:32,010
function the company and the company can
carry certain

464
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:38,760
damages also is recommended to

465
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,650
periodically minutes or tissues for the
topic of

466
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:48,940
attacks that were done previously maybe
they were not discovered

467
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,820
p.m. previous its months comment

468
00:31:52,820 --> 00:32:06,399
previously

469
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,120
well that's it from

470
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:21,929
but i wanna show you even questions
ready to answer

471
00:32:21,929 --> 00:32:25,100
liabilities issue have least d

472
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,309
have you discovered them test

473
00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:31,490
or if you've been generous result of

474
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:35,240
researching the platform itself not

475
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:39,150
test we have done research said

476
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:42,990
happens you have done the analysis of
the source code right

477
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:46,559
why

478
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:53,700
this one tests it was analysis I see
people while system

479
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:59,039
that was preinstalled in our previous is
it was not a black box testing

480
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,789
but it was a white most

481
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:07,419
when an access to the server part an
incline than

482
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:10,480
you have found the proper security for
them

483
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,370
security notes were produced on the
basis of possibilities that were

484
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:15,919
discovered

485
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:26,460
I C thank you

486
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:26,920
thank you very much
