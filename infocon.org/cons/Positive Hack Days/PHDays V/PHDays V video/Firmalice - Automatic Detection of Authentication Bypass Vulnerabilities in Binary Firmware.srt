a pic of me it's supposed to

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,960
gets here and just really just from some

lover in verse about journal as we have
spoke with him

00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,640
on stage a

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,570
I i think is work asked me to lose

8
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,779
come the his main ideas own research

9
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:34,239
sure disclaimer I'm gonna tell you

10
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,750
about humane ideas and that added value

11
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,840
which guys made

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,360
most identification

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,239

ask all the questions to the authors oh
this

research convict someone to plunder the
Fun Fly

17
00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:07,390
important point is d

18
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:12,570
turn to bob for university the guys who
have applied

19
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,580
their hands to any research lab security

20
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,730
identifying T tax has the

21
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:25,000

I'll others over the oldest

25
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,780
I'd sits to for what the guys are
actually doing

00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,680
was published recently studies on

46
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:09,890
as an example

47
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,880
you have devices to be a solution

48
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,950
and 507 to change show after

49
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,640
starring it was identified and

50
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,660
dorms any person has access to this
particular

51
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:27,770
but doing

52
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:33,310
getting username and password to pose

53
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,320
one and the same to prices and they
could managed

54
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,870
racism so these questions ok and we
approach

55
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:48,410
systematically United service
identification these drawbacks

56
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:53,510
before this summer's gillooly

57
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:58,690
those amendment proposed

58
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,950
delivered a little bit later but let me

59
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,930
get you to example where drawbacks would
like to find out

60
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,690
don't fight we would like to attend

61
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,760
by I'm 32 I'm so

62
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,359
are

63
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:19,310
the back first hardcore

64
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,030
login password is addition procedures
you

65
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,669
and to local but you were too secretive
a special control you compare

66
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:31,400
the midline difficult coincides that the
greater access if it's not

67
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,970
teacher could login password the user
who has charisma itself more open

68
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,530
coincides again it's good if it's not
done goodbye

69
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:46,270
first time job completion you will call
back door a possible to throw open

70
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:51,330
bypassing us to the cation second type
of drawback is right about the hidden

71
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:58,160
administrative interface he did you know
that you don't have to enter a secret

72
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,310
for example

73
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,800
delivered put means the

74
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,250
its con prison

75
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:11,330
web admin consisting of

76
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:15,389
Klein teather to rent some figures like
one

77
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:18,919
00:05:16 idea for cetera moving

78
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:24,039
on this bus you can get to tournament
function

79
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:27,860
without entering open password and a
third time

80
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,960
we should get in scope of work

81
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,810
Wilner ability the web interface

82
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,870
Control Panel huge

83
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:42,330
allowed to introduce OS command

84
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:46,539
ice planning or remote code execution

85
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:50,190
example if your old time allows

86
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:54,139
you to make pink you get that

87
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:58,960
in to the entry field know is you on a
pink

88
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,150
in fact this entry get this entry and
you formed

89
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:08,259
the system command Linux

90
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:11,280
that the router pink works at

91
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,740
pink arguments don't you have entered
into and assistant commander should

92
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,430
perform

93
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:19,450
therefore is the user entered the
correct way

94
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:22,760
you can add any command through

95
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,820
and

96
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,480
it could be executed in a persistent
these three types horrible tease

97
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,639
go to this couple just more clinton's
the

98
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,250
are called possible to purpose go to
cation

99
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:42,120
or simply victorious well-known examples

100
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,300
who described Ward these

101
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:56,860
the ideal system analysis him that
advises

102
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:01,300
research shows these but they were so
all can do can

103
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,750
so a blissful nobility models if in the

104
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:10,000
program there's no are too big Asian
procedures called we believe that the

105
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,229
program is

106
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:15,490
marble this approach does or because the
procedure dedication might not be

107
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,370
available to know who must admit

108
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,490
school that monitors all the bills and
then it is gage procedures when it told

109
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:21,830
the

110
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,340
worship the customer base we cannot

111
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,020
setup same signature we should
applicable

112
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,470
cool Linksys and

113
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,490
tooling cameras and other electronic

114
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:41,520
clocks so what is also

115
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,740
in people that static analysis research
bears is hard because a written

116
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,100
to printer picture rearm

117
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,419
to without initial code is earnest and

118
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:58,000
meet to have a sadistic know so the
binary code

119
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,190
dynamic dennis is hard because they
don't have access to the

120
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:08,580
which clear that works with the so
excess

121
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,140
such says that you can observe and
monitor the environment

122
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:16,280
time moments and also most opportune we
cannot determine that

123
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,430
and disbursed because have

124
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,520
the salute ring signature approached

125
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:27,590
so that's a problem so how

126
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,840
it is proposed on when idea

127
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,380
to fired Gazprom men India

128
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,250
search for Knotts the apps

129
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,770
earns so I don't gay identification
procedure but

130
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,000
search for the opportunity to get access
to critical function

131
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,760
which must be close with the cation
procedure

132
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,200
kiss without entering secret

133
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:58,300
in other words you realize my room can't

134
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,080
fireworks and really need to get to the

135
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,710
program to get to the secured from
Shinedown

136
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:11,530
means that many the possibility to go
around indication Plaza modelers

137
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:21,740
approach

138
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,380
on

139
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,880
the peas procedure

140
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,490
candies officially

141
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,990
at a secret which only user knowles

142
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,300
knows scobee allies to the school in

143
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:42,440
so dizzy connection

144
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,370
between busy I'll

145
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,630
and

146
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:53,270
in case we have the access to critical
function some

147
00:09:53,270 --> 00:10:01,030
Indies medication we have a chance of
choosing listen to determine

148
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:05,180
the shower calculated Kim having access
to Bynum

149
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:09,630
coat we should love to get this class
that's

150
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:14,350
the that

151
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:18,510
it is proposed check question is with
what methods

152
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,750
it was said before problems for dinner
weathers who is shown up

153
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:27,450
buckle the paper said a clue dunno will
have access to digital

154
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,500
a clear is that would have had to use
status quo analysis

155
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,860
give you mine developments to differ
that the pictures we need to somehow

156
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:43,450
unifying internal

157
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:43,990
are

158
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:47,650
no need to unify the approach

159
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:53,120
so turn the first their second idea

160
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,660
is how we are won't understand

161
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,930
ratios own lust les fagen proportions
critical

162
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:07,300
where we can all get access without
getting sick with

163
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,720
for schindler that America noted is
stone a possible

164
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,670
about a standout and therefore was up
suggested

165
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:20,330
to the analysis is to get specific
cation

166
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,360
rich cultures who love critical

167
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,230
new channel mentors

168
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:31,970
within the remaining in Lizet

169
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:35,690
and specific functions which we protect

170
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:39,410
access to

171
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:42,920
with which matters it is proposed to

172
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,600
soldiers john Lynch and

173
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,920
have been betting in specifications
functions

174
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:58,560
there with Greece first we have this is
a man assists

175
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,010
and for each crude to cold

176
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:05,600
function we build 'em

177
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,370
Burke slice which allow I

178
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,810
a Los to get all those a up program
operators

179
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:16,700
which input data that move

180
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,060
from the users into to this very

181
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,560
critical function and an each make slice

182
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,650
sent to the

183
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:30,500
same dynamic small occurs execution
procedure

184
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,450
the end

185
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:37,980
she can get Pacific inputs

186
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:42,250
or limitations on the input data which
would allow

187
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:50,160
buzz doing shown in this box lies

188
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,670
reaches critical function so after we

189
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:59,240
received her known limitations on the
input data allowing

190
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,500
to made to pass from the beginning over
suffered

191
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,730
to the critical functions need to check
that it was not

192
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:11,790
holes just truly implantable

193
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:16,110
so then we make this third step which is
authentication my purse

194
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:19,920
check like you this

195
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,570
and today they were found and the
players and the

196
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,870
found really

197
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:32,130
bypass and these other day to schmooze
Bijan

198
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:38,850
to the input if he didn't find out who
can say anything because

199
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,980
our methods will not lower but J neural

200
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,120
real mine be shoe

201
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,550
some extent that this software

202
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:54,100
on there's no

203
00:13:54,100 --> 00:14:00,870
possibilities for identification
procedure which

204
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:05,920
II told about the show and a slut and
I'm going to skip some slight I'm going

205
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:11,560
to go exactly to Z tools

206
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,649
which worsens implemented

207
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:17,649
for automation old

208
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:21,290
these malice is this on is called

209
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,770
by from loves to upload

210
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:35,030
22 special environment the analyzed

211
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,950
certainly can she

212
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:41,090
get the right over I'm any laws of any

213
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:44,320
verbal noun

214
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,870
this to muse and I reworked at the guys
have written

215
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:52,380
can make dynamic

216
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:56,460
symbolic execution to the required point

217
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,860
the third

218
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,870
this such or laos to make back slice

219
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,280
to the quirk point

220
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:15,480
still these functions

221
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,650
supported by the framework

222
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:22,170
which was later to get help

223
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:26,940
he

224
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,460
urged to use tests maybe

225
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:34,930
right comments into this reporters
propose a wreath and possible to write

226
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,660
about feedback whether it works or not

227
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,660
as a

228
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,950
link to get help and address email
address

229
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:48,220
where can ask questions too that's

230
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,770
I think for

231
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,850
polled by them in India tall so you

232
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:58,080
there are questions which I might me
able to answer

233
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:07,680
the head task

234
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,410
book which has a garage attention

235
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,560
and that until two o'clock we have a

236
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,160
break
