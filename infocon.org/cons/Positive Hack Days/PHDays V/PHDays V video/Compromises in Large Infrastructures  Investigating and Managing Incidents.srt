54
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:13,080

55
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,380
how many days is there hacker

56
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,660

Bryan reno said

61
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,150
a like a upload sample to a virus

62
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:45,780
site up

63
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,870
so-called virustotal is equivalent

64
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:56,700
corporate mail so I believe see

65
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,570
is best for many but they will never
confess

66
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:06,970
so I'll

67
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,260
let's go to more serious part says so

68

00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:26,880
to lessons learned and then

168
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,170
especially focusing on is a reverser

169
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:34,910
steptoe preparation so complete full

170
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:38,120
cycle to need to respond to a new
threats

171
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,430
and risks new risks for large
infrastructure so

172
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:46,890
a incidents respondents in this is like
like your

173
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,720
her in the rationing your apartment you
can suspend but you can never stop

174
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,540
completely

175
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,249
hum so that our detailed to kind of a
more granular

176
00:12:57,249 --> 00:13:00,299
at digging down drilling down so

177
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:05,359
that sir horrible structure and that's
how you have to work because at the

178
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:07,350
devil is in the detail as usual

179
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:11,749
each stage is multifaceted from

180
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:16,589
preparation to detect some to

181
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:19,600
response two incidents so you can use

182
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,019
a large number of various tools you

183
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:29,410
care and a CE or internal indicators a

184
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,759
for his son john has public feed that
you can get

185
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:37,529
free of charge download and try to find
something in your network there are so

186
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:38,649
many options

187
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:42,639
and a just like the way you work at each
step

188
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:50,990
in this cycle

189
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:54,019
so we decided to arrange this roundtable

190
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:57,699
without any special homework I'll

191
00:13:57,699 --> 00:14:00,809
to do but to consider several cases
thirty

192
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:05,480
you can not come across in real life and
tell you

193
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,649
are some cases real stories how

194
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:12,079
it happened as it first to

195
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:17,610
chapter when something so when somebody
hurt you and then

196
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,639
ask our money for a pair Cryptologic
like I am

197
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,860
pretty DoS attacks and then

198
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,389
people Oscar money from you to stop them
and I believe came in but please close

199
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:29,809
the talk

200
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:33,689
Kevin can talk to us about it but police
approached him I closer to the mike

201
00:14:33,689 --> 00:14:37,019
I can hear your mmm-hmm

202
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:40,230
recently State lost tax

203
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:44,139
we runs white missus happening mine

204
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:47,319
is your company will be hit with the
dollar service tie

205
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:50,949
and you'll be taken offline one you
think

206
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:55,129
the criminals making contact with you
migrants

207
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:59,089
usually Collins believe in a while

208
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:03,009
don't hyman here again and this process
keeps going

209
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:06,240
and to such times I O so

210
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,420
really really difficult because they
attacks always proxy

211
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,720
through victim boxes all nets

212
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,829
so often response simply money you know
injurious

213
00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:22,490
contingent so one of the very
interesting

214
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:26,249
type of a victim for de dos attack: so I
don't know

215
00:15:26,249 --> 00:15:31,139
if its popular in Russia Taiwan and
China it is quite popular

216
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:35,329
so there is a special group of companies

217
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:38,499
home specialize in gambling

218
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:41,740
gambling in China and Taiwan are

219
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:46,790
illegal so there are some the song was
restricted zones where you can do that

220
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,069
but it's still

221
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:51,610
by law it sir it's banned it's illegal

222
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:55,290
but to is the political situation

223
00:15:55,290 --> 00:16:00,970
amber lack of cooperation of a bit
between the police forces of cont

224
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,910
continental China and Taiwan

225
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,020
nocera

226
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,399
some companies many and many companies
who arrange

227
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,800
gambling services for on their hostage
anti-one

228
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,130
and service client in China and vice
versa

229
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:19,290
the other way around ESO de dos in this
case is the business is illegal if

230
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,020
someone de da says you

231
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,120
so you cannot go to police you cannot
turn

232
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,730
you know a turn to their enforcement
agencies so

233
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:32,500
very interesting approach

234
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,800
and response to deduct attacks have
appeared

235
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,180
for instance your in Hausa processing
like you

236
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,920
a renter a centre de dos a competitor

237
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,350
or rent a hacker who will go on crash

238
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:54,120
they didn't do your system so so this
response to threats

239
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,810
is is interesting week

240
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:01,390
can discuss it then they proactive
Defensor

241
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:06,589
chapter so proactive reaction about in
gambling context

242
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:11,300
I don't know what about russia do have
it in Russia

243
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:15,119
well yes

244
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,679
no names red-eye

245
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,150
but the next question

246
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:28,160
areas hacktivists and the question

247
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,470
are well is they claim what they do

248
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:36,809
and what they get as result because very
often lately

249
00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:38,620
we have seen

250
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:42,280
dumps of passwords of Larcher mail
service says

251
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,299
western Russian but to

252
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:49,770
analyzing those passwords like Sony
Pictures

253
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:53,860
is if you compare

254
00:17:53,860 --> 00:18:01,450
to other dumps so you realize that fifty
sixty seventy percent are sometimes more

255
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,650
of passwords

256
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:06,290
had been published before

257
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:09,929
on other sources so we get a feeling
that

258
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:13,640
people IISER

259
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,590
try to you so some other people's glory

260
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:24,270
or show more that they have done in a
moment

261
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:28,990
across the globe is theft health data I
don't think anybody's really come

262
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:32,480
with the reason why this is happening
sup States

263
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,910
large number hell organizations I'm
having the tightest

264
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:39,830
wanna conclusions could be reason this
is happening is

265
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,970
joining together the tights some recalls

266
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:46,000
some other financial data and one

267
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,290
3 not is him personal information held

268
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:55,360
all your security questions could your
family's

269
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,429
lines previous addresses so stupid

270
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:09,000
missed just want this

271
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,430
YS Lee said there's every April 15th in
the least United States

272
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:17,280
when consumers have to file their tax
returns and usually starting

273
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,200
we start seeing a lot of IRS which is
our tax agency related

274
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,840
campaigns to steel tax refunds

275
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,970
and you know our federal government just
as we figured out how to prevent

276
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:29,510
somebody

277
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:33,160
filing a false tax refund getting your
money and then

278
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,960
you file your taxes and they say already
got a refund sorry

279
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,060
what was really interesting

280
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,390
was listening to the first focused a the
guys

281
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:47,050
saying your health records are held in

282
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:50,200
foreign countries strange one

283
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,540
in my country with Mike offended

284
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,490
someone health because it will come

285
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,860
countries under US law or

286
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:06,380
pretty heavily regulated prevent US of
records from being overseas

287
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,100
every organization I work health records
like that

288
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,450
cross-national so he

289
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:18,320
should let me change your although you
and one more comment about the password

290
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:18,790
dumps

291
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:22,700
are if we see that to they belong to say

292
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:27,480
a prominent well big male mailing system
which is that poss Mar where to

293
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,340
may not to match as the security
requirements of

294
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,470
such system so out of a million
passwords that they

295
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,990
now upload so eighty percent

296
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:43,110
may refer to absolutely

297
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:46,680
soared forum so where the mailbox was
used for registration

298
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:51,620

so hum I use a different group

304
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:12,420
for password for for the password that I
saw in a dump

305
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:16,000
I sort that out and forum was

306
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,690
hacked at that where I registered at
just you know just in case

307
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:23,180
just for fun hmm

308
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:30,850
as a separate question is responding to
the global incidence

309
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:34,200
in the context of cybercrime

310
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,690
so but Matt's banking

311
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:44,660
account sir details when there are so
many victims and their distributed

312
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,800
across countries

313
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,380
and the infrastructure of the attackers

314
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:54,250
is distributed as well and keeps
changing so

315
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,280
I would like to ask you about
experiencer

316
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,840
you know Western teams in responding to
such threats

317
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,520
things was always a challenge was work
with countries

318
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,250
you don't Kong have arrangements with so
as it stands today

319
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,720
UK doesn't have any formal relationships

320
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,810
in legislation way Russia I found a

321
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:18,880
really really difficult to take part in
discussion so

322
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,740
or criminals would do they started China
destroyed

323
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:27,760
on or anyway wearing world they would
always jump through

324
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,010
a country that we had hits Russian

325
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:34,300
they're also misuse the

326
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,970
im structure in places like China or
they would look cool

327
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:41,060
proposed square their organizations

328
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:44,390
protected all work law enforcement

329
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:47,450
so its common in

330
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:50,680
everything the Dell to jump across
countries

331
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,060
with respect you

332
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:57,850
so other any success stories when you

333
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:01,170
actually a succeeded in such

334
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:04,730
incident say no arrested someone
something

335
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:08,420
the white with salt problem is is
definitely

336
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:12,400
what so wanna things

337
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,860
a.m. I found in the community is you
know come here

338
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:19,110
talked a lot on people cards share them

339
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:24,300
'em we did a his work with banking
Trojan

340
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:28,030
is back now who came up since we look

341
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:32,660
I saw we all countries who were talking
to each other

342
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:37,430
time want things with a stop abuse your

343
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:41,970
so slow allow me to comment I guess so
you saw the three million dollars

344
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:44,780
announcement at the FBI website

345
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:48,920
the information leading to an arrest
over Russian hacker

346
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:54,090
so that's the case in point what they
did

347
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:58,560
was use brought

348
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,840
methods to deliver the mail last some
same I'll some

349
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:07,070
struck by they created a and
infrastructure controls

350
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:11,640
the yes the thing created which side in
many different countries

351
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,960
the used I its peer methodology

352
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,970
for the cock on controls min we took
normal

353
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:21,540
rifles response with are you Kong by
calling just

354
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:25,180
infrastructure this wasn't gonna work
because a lot of the

355
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,990
his would just simply recreate
themselves all more again

356
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:32,700
although I'm infrastructure was here im

357
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,360
Russia we had no formal relationship to
be able to

358
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,690
stop this conversation so we did

359
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:42,930
which reached community reached people

360
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:46,130
new concerts think speak to the product
companies

361
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:49,540
on iced thing

362
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:53,150
men we're able to almost erotic the

363
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:57,940
the infrastructure and also I did

364
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:02,289
sting his now three million dollar

365
00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:07,019
runs anybody was like three million
dollars look at the FBI's website

366
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:10,179
yes Autodesk he is ideal the bus

367
00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:14,629
some people are smiling so they have a
good chance to get a rich

368
00:25:14,629 --> 00:25:19,539
if they're smiling so maybe the contacts
and an apple

369
00:25:19,539 --> 00:25:23,220
someone can afford them a

370
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,840
and so we have question number for very
interesting question

371
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,940
it's a its detection an incident

372
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:36,269
response and short life span events and
this %uh this is the infrastructure data

373
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:38,769
set up for a short period of time and
after that

374
00:25:38,769 --> 00:25:43,259
and it just is dismantled term and that
no one

375
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:47,549
it's not important what was before
what's important was that they ventured

376
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:48,360
have taken place

377
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,590
for example in big-game send exhibitions

378
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:55,499
fares with error so then the quickly

379
00:25:55,499 --> 00:25:59,049
removed Canon would you like to comment

380
00:25:59,049 --> 00:26:03,279
on how it was in London and mass media
to follow up on that

381
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,879
one which we with the response to

382
00:26:06,879 --> 00:26:10,899
Olympics was they were to source
business there was the

383
00:26:10,899 --> 00:26:14,009
commercial companies said infrastructure

384
00:26:14,009 --> 00:26:18,080
and they run their own sir to

385
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,659
operation center we ran second sent

386
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:24,700
which had all the government's agencies
so

387
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,499
with cops than resting we were in the
room

388
00:26:28,499 --> 00:26:34,179
GCHQ my whole life Ministry of Defence

389
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:38,159
and we also same we spent months before
training

390
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,409
on exercises understood women's

391
00:26:41,409 --> 00:26:44,889
who who with people only react then

392
00:26:44,889 --> 00:26:48,369
come to a decision about one of the

393
00:26:48,369 --> 00:26:51,730
interesting things a wheeler was

394
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:54,830
so the pope's cycle just Olympics is

395
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:58,580
first Melissa legislation legislation
stops

396
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,789
website been set up to like size

397
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:05,870
some tickets and selling

398
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,660
shirts member Bill

399
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:12,130
sup was a great thing and also that's
happened in every other country where

400
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,750
the lips have been set up so

401
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,810
if you find a website that's hosting

402
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:20,300
stolen by limits against

403
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,400
reach country they will probably have
the legislation in place

404
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:29,160
the other thing up having the to teams
working together that was constant

405
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,060
communication

406
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,810
communication never seen before between
industry the government sought

407
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:37,150
um when actually going towards the
start-up

408
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:40,170
the Olympics what's a

409
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:44,220
mishap most by Japan's is disconnect
everything

410
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,230
there's no connectivity shins

411
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:50,280
timing chains whips the coaches

412
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,670
the yes please well hotel rooms

413
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:57,180
all works on a completely separate
system more

414
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:01,860
what also means is reduces the amount
all running turn the tide

415
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:05,460
pick up would normally have on any
system um

416
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,760
about level of cooperation delivered

417
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,590
successful games we did have an instant
the beginning which was reported in a

418
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,770
couple newspapers

419
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:16,970
a.m. and there was a threats to the

420
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:20,850
electricity system hacktivist was
looking to try

421
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:25,980
switched electricity or just point
around the globe watching the

422
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:29,420
up um one of the things we learn

423
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:32,760
was you need to not only understand how

424
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,840
instruct all the supply chains leading

425
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,290
as well on this occasion the

426
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:42,570
attack suspected didn't actually take
place

427
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:46,410
whipple it was carrier was arrested

428
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:49,960
he was going for a electrical generation

429
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,150
generator side outside all the

430
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:58,750
still around of protection so to lessen
even when you look down

431
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:02,310
everything you can reach these cost

432
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:05,870
what is switch the water electricity or

433
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,310
tools

434
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:13,750
asleep diploma you yo the ship

435
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:18,470
yes I actually sorry for the mechanism
self-protection are in place

436
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:22,260
has so then the bad guys they look for
other ways but they're so they are there

437
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,420
ways is limited

438
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,780
pay for everything security from and
guaranteed

439
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:30,190
so silent on the one hand to so there is
a

440
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:35,570
so the Olympics and in russia the
political situation was tense

441
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:39,960
and the people who wants to send their
message and

442
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,120
but that there is another side to this a
challenge menu financial

443
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,610
legal not very illegal a scheme sir

444
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:51,200
that can be monetize that such events
doctor

445
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,020
so then the there with their this system
was so when they stake

446
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:00,370
a system of steaks and Olympics s on
their way to manipulate

447
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:04,400
at to manipulate there is also the game
so that can certainly

448
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,290
get a lot of material gains four day sir
a

449
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:11,350
so illegal hang

450
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:15,760
person so or companies I'm from the
threats for

451
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,520
for I'm infrastructure infrastructure

452
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:26,400
threat so when we talk about them a CTP
components

453
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,910
available through Internet and

454
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:35,560
a CTP components available through
Internet and M

455
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:40,030
so then the there are people who are so
who work with

456
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:43,080
corporate systems industrial system so
on

457
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:47,790
on on the one hand so they are not
experts on security are

458
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:50,940
Conahan so there is a this a

459
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:55,940
and feeling that so than that

460
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:59,320
you could you have your own IT guy
inside the system

461
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:04,370
and so then there will be no threats if
his she is effective but when we do

462
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:08,520
that way do agree a researcher

463
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,490
analysis all the traffic plus

464
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:16,410
with public resources like a like a true
to

465
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:20,270
and there some other resources

466
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:23,360
for we checked 04 her

467
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,810
for presence for the present some
industrial system seen

468
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:30,590
in internet and we've noticed that

469
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:34,230
so those industrial systems they have

470
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:38,190
an opportunity to to put in a SIM card
to

471
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:41,380
Educare s because many industrial
systems

472
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:44,870
our are far away from their

473
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:48,410
parent offices so while it's such a pair
ask connection

474
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:52,480
so the best solution to provide
communication between the hedges

475
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,170
within the gadget ended and the head
office and

476
00:31:56,170 --> 00:32:01,170
and Italian call and then did not tell
calls that to provide an IP address sent

477
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:04,720
to Japan arrests and this isn't and if
you all over San can

478
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,990
at this camp if you can scan get to
Taipei don't have a remote access

479
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:15,390
how to manage to to so to manage demand
for example to work at pumpers ample or

480
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:18,810
water pump so it is device crashes Sep

481
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:22,010
and then it will be the lower at the
physical protection

482
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:25,810
people will become happier without water
and the specifics of

483
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:31,000
incidents and financial institutions
some believe she has

484
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,800
great job experience in the financial
institutions

485
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,760
as you may guess so there'll also and
incidents occurred from different areas

486
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,510
so weighty

487
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:45,370
security they occur all the time hear
them

488
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:50,740
so for example can and let me give an
example of something that would be a

489
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,840
very telling and them nurseries

490
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:58,210
we spoke about troop nets a a talked
about book let's rip nets

491
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:01,630
that target to at the user's a

492
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:06,950
and and the banking am and the banking
system so for a moto

493
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:10,870
yeah electronic banking services what's
our position here

494
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:13,980
a and in in diff

495
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:17,360
within the framework of the Financial
Group here for four a

496
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,380
book it there is both net then did the
trick is just to catch

497
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,710
can neutralize this book net that's what
the

498
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:28,090
ordinary people yeah think those

499
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:32,070
doctor to catch booked net and the store
s him we have a different position

500
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:32,570
because

501
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:36,080
assortment guess we have different
opportunities for cannot possibly

502
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,820
a lunch at a tactical non-nuclear

503
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:43,650
charge you know and and to kill to kill
the entire

504
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:46,740
house and no they have as blow up an
entire

505
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,820
marriage in so because now we're
neutralize the

506
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,860
implications sir half of

507
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:56,480
their how their those you to purchase
some

508
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,580
used by cyber criminal some implications
consequences 10 stadiums

509
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:05,330
at top top bar approach her Paso ISD

510
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:09,290
as neutral as if it was a bar month
approached Mar month

511
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:12,649
approach it worked with nowhere are
trying just to a

512
00:34:12,649 --> 00:34:16,179
to trace boats bought some

513
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:20,350
and a and and to see what's what's
happening in company is somewhat notes

514
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:20,980
that

515
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:25,980
our that target our users and the
furthest by default we have the best

516
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,679
your spent rapper

517
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:33,020
that that the banker the bank the
banking office can have

518
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:36,619
so then you have the data they serve our
clients so trying to launch is a

519
00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:38,510
sufficient number program sir

520
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:43,059
harmful IT programs for our clients so
that they should know where to turn

521
00:34:43,059 --> 00:34:47,109
if they find something untoward you they
feel that they are infected

522
00:34:47,109 --> 00:34:50,339
and if the client agrees

523
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:53,369
have to a client agrees to

524
00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:57,849
budget to examine to have his computer
examined

525
00:34:57,849 --> 00:35:01,940
by our specialists or so away send our
specialists

526
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:05,319
detail our specialists will do the
forensic image

527
00:35:05,319 --> 00:35:09,780
are the computer an elaborate and then a
virtualized this

528
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:13,109
if it's possible if malware allows to

529
00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:18,069
at a virtualized this image invests way
they were accumulated the database

530
00:35:18,069 --> 00:35:21,930
of working functioning running boats
boats

531
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:25,190
a.m. have different companies them and

532
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:28,750
different types said different something
but not builders

533
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:33,819
and there we have for a chance to see
what new targets appear

534
00:35:33,819 --> 00:35:38,240
Hin in malware file said Pierre her so
into decoding

535
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,480
dick and 22 decoded decoding of these

536
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:46,540
funds and Nursery provided information
to the people who are involved in their

537
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:50,420
in the in the banking infrastructure and
then they

538
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:54,530
Fulop on it and they're so they they
start tracking down tracing does

539
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:58,710
I'm telling you to give an idea that
that Manx

540
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:02,000
a time they do not hope for a

541
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,010
on any outside providers information
they do not

542
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:09,020
rely on them and they're trying to do a

543
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:12,040
what they can within their own
competence and within their power to

544
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,960
protect the client

545
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,780
and the they are very active on that
account and

546
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:20,390
mosser so you've seen in many countries
sent so there are some

547
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:24,930
fingers about the presence

548
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,579
and as 0 days

549
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:32,109
sometimes it happens but why should you
suspend your 0 day if there are mistakes

550
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:36,059
about another very interesting object
this appropriate active defense very

551
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:37,400
interesting subject matter

552
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,130
so when they crack they're trying to
hack you and your hacked them

553
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:46,540
and the Sun so decide a they try to
reboot us but we get on a stronger so to

554
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:46,940
what

555
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,849
had to what extent it is ethical and
legal and how to

556
00:36:50,849 --> 00:36:53,960
assault to vindicate yourself

557
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:59,160
plan to take revenge so one guy from
Luxembourg I so he was a

558
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,960
trying to learn everything about the
host machine is a Hong Kong Kong

559
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,859
and the he published a what you found

560
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:10,930
so some some data that he found on on

561
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:15,200
Hong Kong computers or owned by some
companies in Taiwan

562
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,299
from murder so the data was

563
00:37:18,299 --> 00:37:21,609
taken out via Dolce a computer see in
pain

564
00:37:21,609 --> 00:37:24,619
and then the record to became public
domain

565
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:28,190
and then the happy people security guys
came

566
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:31,950
and they've anyone just writes an
official complaint

567
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:35,970
and that they have been compromised this
so then we'll have to take

568
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:40,760
legal action against them and the so
enforcement people came

569
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,910
and this is legal or illegal

570
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:48,559
so then has a different scenarios play
out

571
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:54,339
them so legality issue legality is very
high on the agenda an answer

572
00:37:54,339 --> 00:37:57,859
result and its addressed did did but
different countries

573
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:02,799
indifferent I think unauthorized

574
00:38:02,799 --> 00:38:06,640
tax even against Tamil actors just
generally unisom

575
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,680
cell there are people

576
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,100
a certain point crime call

577
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:16,970
certain nations may respond poorly so

578
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:22,290
as US citizens were attacking Russian
assets belonging to a criminal actor

579
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:27,290
the Russian Federation have something to
say actor

580
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:30,440
you know but there's also the concern
about taxes at

581
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,040
a lot criminal networks rely compromised
infrastructure

582
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,590
sold taking destructive action against
compromised

583
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:43,790
infrastructures yeah your you're getting
a criminal act and there's

584
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:47,320
and can several high-profile even using
legal means

585
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,770
takedown compromised infrastructure
infrastructure you

586
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:55,900
by that actors as uses heads a very bad

587
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:01,880
a

588
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,090
a drink the that was a ser one

589
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:08,600
a him has some advice

590
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,980
what's legal as a massive to to work

591
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:16,280
to her to deal with the cybercriminals

592
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,500
a so some advice assist with has

593
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,119
so we cannot do ok not did those those
who did those

594
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:28,310
us and we cannot just symmetrical the
retaliate because and business ethics

595
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:30,060
and because we cannot do

596
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:33,550
otherwise would be like them some but
one else still we

597
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:37,900
her has so there are many insist we can
just trace track down the guy

598
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:43,890
who is involved too in the him in this
accident and a and then contact him

599
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:48,260
and on officially to talk him in my
email

600
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,710
and so we know who you are and know what
your character or

601
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:55,040
pass on say you know what you're doing
and we

602
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,680
suggest to stop because this is not
doing something that is good

603
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:04,800
and it's strange because not one person
cases but sometimes it works

604
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,060
some some people say oh yes okay well

605
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,670
O'Pry promise I will be with my head
wondering

606
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:14,830
in and then a cement that so too

607
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:18,360
retaliate against the same target and is
a stupid

608
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,860
and in majority of cases so there is
always a

609
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:25,570
legal remedy or just talking to the guy

610
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:29,740
concerned and staying within to be
ethical and legal

611
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:34,740
staying on the legal side of the wall
and where you can see

612
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:42,470
good examples so 110 the aspect so ok I
can respond to the incident says so

613
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,060
because some companies don't care

614
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:48,380
and they're so where they've been hacked
and have not been handy just don't care

615
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:53,050
much some care and

616
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:57,810
so that's why her so for example soon
and the media community

617
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:02,670
is a good lever had to put pressure on
those and so2 respond this

618
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:06,580
answers so this I'm the screenshot

619
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:09,650
shows that's the way or website though

620
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:13,440
wanna from the country's look like and
so it looks like some time ago so then

621
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:20,580
as a the government site taken from

622
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:25,340
10 the archives structures York and the

623
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:29,200
question/answer when is it a good time
to go public

624
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,430
with the breach in your organization so
when we should just

625
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:36,800
her have talked to the media about that

626
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,360
so should we should talk to the media at
what point

627
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:47,040
we should talk to the media Monday

628
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,790
he recognises from working in North
Coast

629
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:54,070
number investigations companies but also
from the Olympics is

630
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:57,310
the on people are going to find out

631
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:00,420
been hacked know whether that's because
you've got a whistleblower inside

632
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:03,890
company he speaks newspaper always
because you

633
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:07,700
work regulated market you have to tell
the government

634
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:11,920
pollen whole bunch was gonna come out my
recommendation is

635
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,100
take a grip you need to do this in a
vault

636
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,270
need to have a plan about how you can
approach this so the

637
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:21,440
you can take consideration the poor

638
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:26,560
company you can take government you can
take place from your legal voices

639
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,730
ahead of anything happening this means
then when you stand up there is only a

640
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:31,640
single message

641
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:35,140
you have a single message truth and

642
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:38,750
the wine which present is then your
choice not being hounded

643
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:41,910
boy the media to give a response I'll

644
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:46,010
it also works really well you've got a
talking head obscene companies where

645
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:49,720
a call one individual have seen you
within the organization who wants to be

646
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,590
that's okay

647
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:53,780
the problem is that person doesn't
understand the technology

648
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,760
its to fix the problem looking at.
because the arced

649
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,490
height questions and con altri then you
lose

650
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:05,570
on it which was protect your reputation
um

651
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:08,810
so I would always recommend you think
about what

652
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:12,790
as mister look like before you attack
distrust me this always happens on a

653
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:13,470
weekend

654
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:16,590
Friday on a public holiday when Kong
hold people

655
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:19,840
the the other thing I would have also
this message is

656
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,860
had you wanna site was positive at this
time

657
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:26,840
everything sings negative so have in
your back pocket whether or not you're

658
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,640
going to offer

659
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:31,210
free antivirus affected with you go

660
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:35,390
offer a package where if there are
people who have the tights stolen

661
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:39,100
are you can offer to play for credit

662
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:42,200
reference Company to the often in the
future um

663
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,450
also really works well

664
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:50,090
if involves all something like this you
educate everyone about

665
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:53,930
how you gonna do that but also educate
stall about how to protect themselves

666
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:54,480
and

667
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,860
so think about what's up hygiene you
want to come

668
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:01,770
me and make sure everyone within the
company knows um

669
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:06,380
it also helps a few a.m. have so so
frequently

670
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:10,950
ask questions prepped in advance as well
as against the three a press office is

671
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:12,060
clear through legal

672
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:15,410
X 10 things you don't want to do when
you when you put your messages L

673
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:19,100
is to give information which might

674
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:24,350
used against you any in civil fines so
this is all about protecting your

675
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:25,670
reputation but also

676
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:28,770
protecting the ship so that didn't work
for the

677
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:32,880
the roster councils close accounts where
I am

678
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,310
I small government Paul a region-based
UK

679
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:40,110
wanna their I'm seniors had her

680
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:44,350
Facebook and Twitter account taken over
a problem with that was

681
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:47,560
she denied happens the post sale there

682
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:51,690
was got anonymous oversaw and even
though he was posting

683
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:57,030
aside up still 29 shipping he then moved
on and

684
00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:01,030
use the same password for Twitter ice
helps too

685
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:04,040
government accounts he then moved into
the mail server

686
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:07,530
the else as well on

687
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:11,350
by this point they were still denying
anything was happening

688
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:15,360
and they were getting all around the
press was front door

689
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,890
for in a ranch dying I'd complete in
Toro

690
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:22,740
just looks cheap because the you could
see the press

691
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:26,610
running stories every day to taking a
proactive approach really has

692
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:31,480
a greatly or ultimately what happened
was they didn't know how far into the

693
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,410
system Scott

694
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:36,890
or so we ended up having to shell they
have to send everyone home

695
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:40,480
up payments there was a hope brought to
you

696
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,700
benefits thing should be played out arms

697
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:47,670
public lost as well because they when
the shop system shop whole thing down

698
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:49,020
and that was to do this

699
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:51,960
response so the by taking a really neck
