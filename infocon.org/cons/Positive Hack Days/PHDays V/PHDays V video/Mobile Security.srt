1
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,970
its Alexander ok sorry years lower legs
understand and together we let ourselves

2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:08,510
in

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:13,350
and I the water so alien to take the
next 30 minutes or so

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:18,350
till the research we default in the area
for mobile security on Android devices

5
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:24,220
work

6
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,340
sold

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,770
up my lips are very popular and widely
spread through the snow

8
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,910
the number of mobile up users

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,120
is growing leaps and bounds and by now
he has already exceeded the number of

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,750
users of personal computers

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,430
up

12
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,500
but which essentially means that
increasing share

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,879
all personal data confidential titties
and trusted to mobile devices

14
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,330
and obviously gets process students

15
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:57,540
often lost income per license mobile
device

16
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,420
we're talking about brother data

17
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,299
CDC's see the niece other bank details

18
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:11,890
come numbers you name it

19
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,240
lodging ball

20
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,990
also authentication data logins and
passwords

21
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,930
all sorts of things he will execute
yourselves all

22
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,360
his exploiting vulnerabilities

23
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,420
in mobile applications like this ok

24
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,530
can be hugely detrimental both to
service users

25
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:37,550
answers owners tell this social amis

26
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,800
their research into security Obama loves

27
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,410
is a very important function in terms of
work contributing to increased security

28
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,259
profile

29
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:51,979
mobile apps Android's

30
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:56,119
almost a rolls the markets for
smartphones where talk about 40 percent

31
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:56,990
a little Mike

32
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:05,450
seventy percent of the russian markets
not surprisingly so because Android

33
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,820
devices are often

34
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,820
pretty cheap aunt

35
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,940
the Bay Area TM tree for Android
developers is also their low

36
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,610
lot so developers will also devices
supported

37
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,709
also applications available according to
our experience even the leading banks

38
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:22,540
today

39
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,299
often insurers development of mobile
applications to

40
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:29,650
search party providers

41
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,060
I should be clear the a software
developer is

42
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,890
rarely an express in information
security and very

43
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,340
railey Wilbanks d-mont

44
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,220
thats particular requirements as far as
I S is concerned

45
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,660
are observed and Android platform itself

46
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,280
his hole holes a

47
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,180
he was more polite about it say provides
more opportunities both developers

48
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,620
and to the not a well-intentioned guys

49
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:07,210
of

50
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:13,880
should cycle telling us for that which
is our company the last several years

51
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,380
have been analyze a mobile applications
for a number of platforms including

52
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,720
Android

53
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,910
so

54
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,000
on the slides you see the statistics
available on

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,640
fifty different applications we analyze
the last 12 months

56
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,020
so all the supplications consider and
sell

57
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,860
sorry the shoes have very high security
profiles were talking about mobile

58
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,420
banking

59
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,610
services as well as mail services and
e-commerce

60
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:46,310
applications would our analysis has
shown that

61
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:50,030
almost powerful this obligations have
critical vulnerabilities

62
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,190
was a critical would mean the easy to
exploit

63
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,000
him and the impact can be tremendous

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,070
we're talking about compromise

65
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,209
from the data personal data financial
losses

66
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:14,709
both for users answers owners good

67
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:17,980
ok let me explain the analytical
methodology we is

68
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,250
old

69
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,510
would

70
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:27,280
was analyze not just the source code
publications

71
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,889
birds also the applications

72
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:34,460
that's come a spot of the binary AP case

73
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,580
from Google Play whatever no

74
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,440
what we analyze a binary good

75
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,919
are usually do is to contact to
decompile a BK and converted to its

76
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,080
source code in Java

77
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,900
good

78
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,050
that we

79
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,570
run Hornets the well-known automatic
static

80
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:03,770
analysis tools and only experts are
invited to check for false positives

81
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,630
want after that

82
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:12,660
we do manual static analysis well
socially worry the Colt

83
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,050
and we analyze a number of other tools

84
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,190
who will

85
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:23,720
well we understand what the functions of
an application are

86
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,830
I want the founder bill is a platforms
I'll

87
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:32,930
we know where to focus we analyze the
filesystem Sunna we do

88
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:37,870
menu dynamic analysis this means that we
essentially

89
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:42,349
analyze the application s possible
bigger environment

90
00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:45,930
will be interested its interaction with
the FLA file system

91
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,380
other

92
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,330
I'm sorry interaction with the other
devices that can can actively

93
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:56,030
in again we check all this interface is

94
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:59,220
for data leakage %uh opportunities

95
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,270
than pension file systems already

96
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,410
the at the sites we analyze different

97
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:09,900
data warehousing column could be file
systems or log so what have you

98
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,030
again for the same purpose finding
potential data leakage opportunities

99
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:19,190
old would

100
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,350
we also analyze the authentication

101
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,550
system before it's a

102
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:32,850
resilience to penetration now we did a
load of this manual analysis we have

103
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,120
significant experience in this respect
we also had some

104
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:42,710
semi automated tools the world

105
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:47,610
him want

106
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:51,030
our findings are as follows: good

107
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:55,290
the mobile applications so they're
expected to be secure in fact I

108
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:59,250
Nault many of them have critical
vulnerabilities said

109
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,260
the quality of the cold an average is
pretty low

110
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:09,130
him we realize it would be a good idea
for us

111
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:14,500
to collect all those insights and
develop a single tool that what's

112
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:19,130
have the power all the sensors on board

113
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:22,660
this is exactly what I'm talking about
called in Colt

114
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,370
and essentially can automates

115
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,800
mo so the process like previously
described

116
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,990
the way it works shown here world

117
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,440
now we can download a particular
application

118
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,810
filling a link on Google Play well we
know that all applications Store and

119
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:42,690
Google Play is

120
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:50,630
a PK files which is essentially an
executable code for Java shield

121
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:56,380
also it also contain a number of other
important files including the manifesto

122
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,440
which shows whole team

123
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,000
early editions available for this file
supplication so we

124
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,080
unpack million picking ABK filed

125
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:10,560
we get the executable bytecode

126
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,740
for each other virtual machine old

127
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,610
it is on the bites cohort

128
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:21,430
that sweeper for most article a static
analysis

129
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:25,140
him will

130
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:29,500
want

131
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,280
we know from experience that is much
more convenient

132
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,750
to see the results of this analysis in
the source code

133
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,810
not the bites Colt which means a we

134
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:44,039
compiled by callback good

135
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:49,170
would only we have developed a
Decompiler is

136
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:52,320
balto this analytical device

137
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,650
world so it will regenerate the source
goes well at the same time

138
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:01,750
adding numbers appliance and that's way
Europe

139
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,560
your expert will be able to read the
source codes and will be able to use

140
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,450
reefer between the two Charles old

141
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:14,640
week also analyze the Android manifesto

142
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,660
all and the job I cuz dey mention that
already

143
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,930
no let me explain what kind of
algorithms

144
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:25,960
are on a bite Colt check was talking
about the full range of static an out

145
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,880
static analysis L goes it could be

146
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,139
template search

147
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:34,639
would

148
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,480
we start out by

149
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,119
identify a man a parametrized pastures
if you like

150
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:47,379
that will the symptomatic individual
vulnerabilities

151
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:51,480
and after that we also analyze the

152
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,839
command flows and data flows and sold
out

153
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:59,839
to that sense wiki is the well-known
tools doubts

154
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,160
we know from the world of compiler
technology is this could be

155
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,919
dataflow old an hour says sentiment
analysis procedural

156
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:12,769
interests issue analysis and so on and
so forth think we're talking about the

157
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:14,569
full range well goes here

158
00:10:14,569 --> 00:10:20,499
was more picky listing information
security is set

159
00:10:20,499 --> 00:10:24,319
we are also using a group of %uh taint
and taint similar

160
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:28,009
algorithms good

161
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:32,660
where particular a label a particular
time can be propagated through the Colts

162
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:37,989
for example this data comes from and on
trusts or so will will be

163
00:10:37,989 --> 00:10:41,489
as tracking the state until it exits the
system

164
00:10:41,489 --> 00:10:45,579
good

165
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:50,739
other labels can actually be fixed as
well such is confidentiality labels

166
00:10:50,739 --> 00:10:55,049
interval analysis is also used

167
00:10:55,049 --> 00:10:58,419
leah is that's at every point in the
program

168
00:10:58,419 --> 00:11:04,480
ill try to identify to assert say in the
range of possible values for every

169
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,020
integer variable

170
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,640
the same goes for arithmetic operations
Inc additional operations

171
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,709
we'll see

172
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:19,040
you string analysis for string variables
obviously

173
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,820
and this could be Houston orders to

174
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:28,480
track re and those fixes concatenation
and other operations

175
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:37,330
or would

176
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,360
was based on the research has a

177
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,020
mentioned before we identify several
vulnerability colossus for mobile

178
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,050
applications

179
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:50,380
the we consider to be quite prevalent

180
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:55,180
and data at the same time quite critical
an easy to exploit

181
00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:02,240
wall

182
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,770
old

183
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,940
a is certainly no the year official a
buscar

184
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:11,590
close occasion and its offer Research's
mobile top sandal

185
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,890
want their fall

186
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:20,530
who going forward to my presentation I'm
going to use that classification

187
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:25,260
would first-class a boner abilities are
those

188
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,290
that arise during data transfer he's
been

189
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:32,370
let's look at how they actually rise

190
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,810
would

191
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,550
the

192
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,470
in up for example

193
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:45,130
wanna Napa saw came to web surfer you
can be doing so

194
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:49,500
good at doing that by and not protect
channels such as they should be

195
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:54,079
doesn't happen very often but it does
happen

196
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,040
particularly where it connects not to
the main web server but rather to

197
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:05,070
auxiliary web services card information
for example

198
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:09,310
and again this could be he usually
dangers

199
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,510
will this is

200
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:15,829
the by the way a way to mount a phishing
attack

201
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:21,260
old well secondly there are
vulnerabilities

202
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,029
lanes to well-documented dollar bills
his lips

203
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:30,190
the his also

204
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,589
on the rest of the world over older
notice such as not checking for

205
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:40,200
certificate chains when SSL connections
are set up

206
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:46,070
this is in fact something happens very
often up

207
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:50,620
well it's somewhat the weekends MIT I'm
sort of in tax

208
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,890
pay doesn't invalidate macomb invalidate
them completely

209
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,769
will

210
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:59,089
such vulnerabilities can be solved using
template search

211
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:02,519
doesn't

212
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:05,839
or good

213
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,350
or I'll wasn't

214
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:17,940
well confidential data leak up

215
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,730
and can be a look for with an adaptation
of the tight

216
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:25,010
taint analysis could be functions are
you re sticks

217
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,110
don't

218
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,779
ok that's a really interesting stills

219
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:35,480
in order to certain whether particular
set up date

220
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,269
these it confidential not the

221
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:42,279
so in the lost top 10

222
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:46,630
will be looking Jens good I'm sorry
numbers 3&4

223
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,730
not the next group

224
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:53,820
of vulnerabilities miscellaneous you
data storage so

225
00:14:53,820 --> 00:15:00,470
good during past reversal attacks

226
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:03,490
and other case

227
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:07,630
and take a risk and get access to hold
dear external memory

228
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,490
cash exchange but for or locks

229
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:15,250
good good

230
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:19,140
their fall storing sensitive data in old

231
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,290
Sirius is very stupid

232
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:27,260
it's very easy by the way to identify
although serve older adults using

233
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,350
template search

234
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:32,860
taint analysis and other tools him

235
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,260
Lex vulnerability close

236
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:40,279
which is quite typical Android because
the previous two

237
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:43,520
good

238
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:48,750
would also apply to this want

239
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:53,740
are linked to insure pro Cys interaction
this is so is he is very official

240
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,330
and we believe that is he is

241
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:01,930
theory and securely most cases don't

242
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:05,070
so this in true bro sis interaction

243
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:08,910
ok ambulances services activity

244
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:11,920
interns content providers and broadcast
receivers

245
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,850
will want

246
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:20,980
hood who

247
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,780
what kinda vulnerabilities could they
include want

248
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:28,310
year for example if

249
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:32,110
your application what does no really
close this components from other

250
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,510
applications probably some other
application can easily claim access to

251
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:35,960
them

252
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,510
for example your application could be
sending pin codes or

253
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:43,610
nice words around the confidential data
using a broadcast message

254
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:47,800
an attacker's application can

255
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,010
easily interceptors datum would

256
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:55,940
million stats you're receiving
broadcasts

257
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:59,090
you people who

258
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:04,010
him who

259
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:08,500
this essentially means that malware can
sense you

260
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,300
and particular message was your
application will process since

261
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:19,329
that will be compromised by doing that
world this is your classical

262
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:22,970
CEO yes in the area where

263
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:26,970
he is Thomson check for Knowles or

264
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:33,060
case flow system blood

265
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,000
and again this is how efficient

266
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,690
can also important he usually find the
solubilities

267
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:44,600
by way of intellisearch and different
verifications

268
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:49,200
good please note: would

269
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,940
L goes we use for analysis want

270
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,460
should

271
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,660
usually made two criteria first

272
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:08,660
he well hittin

273
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:12,540
they should be comprehensive we want the
tools

274
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:18,260
to give us summary like as Yara
vulnerable assess possible

275
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,500
good

276
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,940
it on the other hand 2012 power now
toast to be in line with their own

277
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,140
criteria

278
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:30,310
now we want to minimize false positives
this is well known problem

279
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:38,920
of such a canal assess both quite often
standardized

280
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,050
heuristic say is up

281
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:46,610
and they can take into account that the
killer is a particular

282
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:51,270
for will or would

283
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:54,750
it's also very important in mobile
applications

284
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,790
your to use a reliable crypto

285
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:01,730
well look quite often

286
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:06,840
for a creep sees use or poor hashing is
used to refer confidential data

287
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,670
would for example

288
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:15,000
many APs to use EC be creeped up

289
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,370
again it's easy to assert know that by
using

290
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:21,380
template search 14 turn alice is

291
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:27,520
no would

292
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,570
mobile application just like any other
user services

293
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:34,170
have a wide range of

294
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:39,480
folder abilities related to poor whip

295
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,040
checks over import data this Asus other
usually people

296
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,400
searching the web for example so we're
talking about injections

297
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,100
code injections ask a lynch actions bust
reversals

298
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:57,120
when or good

299
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,340
this would be the classical taint
analysis case

300
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:05,940
good well

301
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,130
so we need to set up a base Evo sources

302
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:12,400
its what have you include I'm sorry

303
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,760
downloads page you respect to a curious
individual platforms

304
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:21,030
wasn't finally we're going to show you
sure Demel

305
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:27,450
it well

306
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,520
was you that will illustrate our
methodology

307
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,840
on the base over specific application

308
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,840
we are going to see all this stuff so
our analysis

309
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,860
unpacking this assembly d cumpilation

310
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:45,960
analysis would

311
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,700
and you will see how we are using our
particular utility

312
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,830
so much so stuff will be automated word

313
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:58,380
for demonstration purposes we have
selected an application from

314
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:05,540
one of the larger banks was elia quite
comfortable showing this stuff to you

315
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:09,600
because certain the developers have
removed the vulnerability but

316
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,400
we've tried to camouflage the bank so
the

317
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,110
or they don't feel bad about it good

318
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,160
so you're going to see how the analyzer

319
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,480
with processes the file looks for dollar
bills

320
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,820
and then we're going to use a fiddler in
order to try exploiting is a real time

321
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:33,180
wilson et to Device emulator

322
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:38,500
thats who so it would be helpful so

323
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:44,210
doing exactly the Weiss that's right we
are

324
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,820
up closing in a PK to the analyzer

325
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:50,410
well so the stuff phase automated so go
straight to

326
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:55,100
the end early and alice is itself
because awaiting free with a bit too

327
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,640
boring

328
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,710
know they saw the results CC

329
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:08,780
the rest several critical
vulnerabilities and the results

330
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,820
show thats any risk Rico up sorry

331
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:15,140
this critical vulnerabilities all

332
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,600
but mostly fall into the category of a
week

333
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,900
SSL for certificate chain checks

334
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,280
and no checks word domain certificates

335
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,840
so we d compiles the codes

336
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:33,809
together with them the line date

337
00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:40,820
sese very easy for us to see which
classes they belong to lead

338
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:45,150
a you'll see that verify for example
only returned true

339
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:48,120
want

340
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:53,420
cool this who

341
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,680
with good obviously this application

342
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,820
is vulnerable to the man in the middle
attack which we so we

343
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:06,120
our goal being to use the fiddler and
mobile emulator

344
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,280
to exploit it you below thing because

345
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,960
the bank obviously has not been properly
up for skaters would

346
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,800
well so we've ensure the looking at a
password there

347
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,500
and the fiddler interest says hijacks
the connection

348
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,250
and now we see in plain tax the Logan

349
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:29,270
and the passwords good

350
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:33,380
please note: without will not change
anything we did not install this route

351
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,160
if it gets here

352
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,080
which actually could change the
situation of

353
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,050
you so it's important to remember that
such holder does exist maybe then also

354
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:45,910
prevalent

355
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:49,540
but this particular certificate
vulnerability for example is

356
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:54,680
quite prevalent police or other such
applications are very vulnerable to men

357
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,720
in the middle attacks

358
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,390
all you need to do is just make sure
that the user installs a particular

359
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,220
certificate

360
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:07,590
but I could be also bring dangers the

361
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:12,570
was more guys we just told you about our
experience in a in a research a mobile

362
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:14,190
applications for Android its

363
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:17,490
or with you

364
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:21,110
sharing or tracking their information
security standards

365
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:24,490
we've also explains

366
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:28,200
the way our analytical methodology works

367
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,860
and you head me your chance to see
another tool

368
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,400
this would

369
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,640
when all trying to say you can fully
automate everything

370
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,980
you'll silly it's demanding work which
will secure

371
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:46,420
information security experts on my go
into will become

372
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:50,360
jobless said

373
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,490
some vulnerabilities though

374
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:57,350
Kelly year verified in dynamic mode
others will need to be very flight

375
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,180
statically

376
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:04,520
however this still automates what can be
automated

377
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,700
and also enables you to analyze the
application in binary form

378
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,620
thank you very much puts a little my
presentation and bizarre according to

379
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,880
the Social Security

380
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,480
ideas I E C as he have a question

381
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:22,410
please use Mikes chillin Klein

382
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:25,790
my name is Yuri his

383
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,960
will good

384
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,240
comment a couple of questions you

385
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,580
he gorgeous think about excessive
looking

386
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:40,530
of messages his I think he had a slotted

387
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:43,730
that talks about served in clothes
storage

388
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:46,990
or as the cars will or

389
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:51,530
are also the daddio logs because this
all happens very often

390
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:56,180
would in mobile applications law
excessive Laux

391
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,360
our caps is debugging locks were in fact

392
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,520
everything can be lost word

393
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:09,920
actually I think we have the swine sour
in the slicer absolutely right

394
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,290
this is true for the

395
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:14,580
file storage cash memory or

396
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:19,160
not memories Hills sorry so

397
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,400
the log some cereal ok so often contain

398
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,010
the most sensitive information including
passwords this is your dollar bills he

399
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,210
rated

400
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:30,540
to would to get it correctly

401
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:34,200
the Android binary and analysis well

402
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,620
emails here to bypass up for scary shit

403
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,240
here you

404
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:46,810
because classical analytical techniques
usually work on source codes

405
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:50,400
up

406
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:57,000
this well we know that some malware
application so the

407
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,850
know for years premium up skaters just
used

408
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:04,640
42 well discovery local

409
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,910
less right to their own different levels
of this cation

410
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:12,490
this automated tools I'm pretty good at
dealing and doing away with simple

411
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:16,800
this cation know if you're using some

412
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,090
sophisticated alpha skaters that was
certainly create problems in the

413
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,690
compilation process

414
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,970
so this would-be

415
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:30,260
be area for development for us to ensure
support for proper

416
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,590
he with the office cationic a you've
mentioned

417
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:45,010
false positives and false negatives cool

418
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:47,490
was a bigger concern for you

419
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:50,770
to reach use number of false-positive or

420
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:54,040
falls negatives cool

421
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:58,520
would

422
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,220
watchers think is the current ratio old

423
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:07,840
between the two customers or
Planetshakers compare ES cells

424
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,960
to competing solutions over because
there are some rights we have

425
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,620
ep scanner fortified an application
inspector

426
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:24,670
you did

427
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:27,710
will I mention that we always have a to
object is

428
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:31,080
lo traje is a number of false negatives
to use your language

429
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:37,750
would

430
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:41,090
effect there is

431
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:44,750
no in here in conflict between searching

432
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:49,570
between you for waiting for snakes for
sports until a certain threshold is

433
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:50,160
reached

434
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,330
good way using different

435
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:58,690
into election /url techniques in order
to verify the dollar bills

436
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:08,890
aren't when the stand we need to find
the golden mean between them

437
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,980
or we weren't

438
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,240
you it is more important for us year

439
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,410
to reduce the number of false negatives

440
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:21,210
was the only world

441
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:26,790
that's why we're so serious about to
sign a criticality levels

442
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:31,230
to vulnerabilities obviously we have
more force posters that false negatives

443
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:34,720
can you compare yourselves to any vendor

444
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,560
you know what's who held a vendor

445
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,070
police know yet so we haven't really

446
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,570
done this comparison word

447
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:51,330
we believe that such automation enables
here too

448
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:55,500
analyze ABK files from Google Play and I
just think

449
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,570
any commercial protests punctured

450
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:06,110
water to be more precise we know that
IBM has a more chill that supports it

451
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:12,100
which I testing it and I can assure you
that results were

452
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,250
very underwhelming very few voters does

453
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:19,650
actually found that's cool of

454
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:24,300
for so I think we actually have a series
advantage over them

455
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:29,720
old as she goes the

456
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,970
LL Cool Base I think way using the same
static tools says

457
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:38,920
fortified others we're developing our
database

458
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:44,300
think we can be stronger than the other
this has never been our objective so far

459
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,570
it so far only objective was to cover
Android's

460
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:52,560
properly now to ensure proper reach and
I think I've been successful in doing

461
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,649
that

462
00:30:53,649 --> 00:30:57,609
well okay

463
00:30:57,609 --> 00:31:00,820
it sounded like he has some vendor
ambitions

464
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:04,399
is that true or a only to hear this

465
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:08,539
Journal that's projected please stay
tuned

466
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:11,669
a will happen sometime in the future
okay thank you

467
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:15,479
mccurdy precluded from

468
00:31:15,479 --> 00:31:19,839
open securities treated as a bust answer
in code is your in-house

469
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:23,709
development well with it partnership
okay im

470
00:31:23,709 --> 00:31:26,909
who in have a local

471
00:31:26,909 --> 00:31:30,669
thats reminds me of social security
which is

472
00:31:30,669 --> 00:31:35,289
knowles coincidence the all-party I go
into salads

473
00:31:35,289 --> 00:31:41,450
or want I'm not going to answer your
question sir whatcha respect

474
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:44,769
in several months time there will be a
public announcement

475
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:48,809
be you can already provide your services

476
00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:56,279
basil a solution that's right spread be
diversion assuming a test version

477
00:31:56,279 --> 00:32:00,059
available publicly no publicly search by
not

478
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:01,830
who

479
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:07,470
you indeed we've been providing our
services

480
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:11,200
in this particular market segment for
quite some time events

481
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,360
live choice of publicly available word

482
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,500
only let me ask a more in depth question
them

483
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,559
have you considered it any

484
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:27,559
Android labor is yep

485
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:30,750
any filters such as access us cultures

486
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:36,809
that would enable you to filter user
