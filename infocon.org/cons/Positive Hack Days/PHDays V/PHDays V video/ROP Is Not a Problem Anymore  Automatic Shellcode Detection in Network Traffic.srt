1
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,399
today we're going to speak about

2
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:12,490
I'll be a show called discovery said we
were involved in shoko discoveries in

3
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,370
cause I seventy years ago with Yvonne
and every time

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:19,210
and all the presentations and
conferences we have presented at work

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,180
within us the same question over and
over again do you know how to discover

6
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,949
Roop sold and we started asking this
question

7
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:30,439
yes will a small

8
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:35,370
suggestion what he's show Caldwell show
calls traditionally are

9
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:41,190
some malicious executable code which
exploits air Self worked with america

10
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:47,350
mara corruption to show cause our
carousel before overflow Allstate

11
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,309
commercial all

12
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:52,600
and any other overflow structures all
the errors which are related to the

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,079
memory

14
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:58,120
can be counted on a show called hairs
and well basically this is a small

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,500
example how it works

16
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,539
we have some kinda cold we have some
carava

17
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:06,740
well cold which it calls function
functions

18
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:11,039
waits for the in search of a certain
date a sudden wind which has to be to

19
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:11,369
just

20
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:14,399
which where the user trust was certain
data

21
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:18,619
so what have I missed a good at normal
time mistake they store their its own

22
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:21,939
address which point on the next
instruction guide dysfunction

23
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:27,649
doubts to rest registries an selects
certain area for local variables

24
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:32,340
and the media of the year prior studies
to rewrite the sierra local

25
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,179
variables to rewrite the return address
then we transfer the control

26
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:39,319
to the the quiz show called and then we
execute these

27
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:43,310
any called well I would like to say that

28
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,479
this is a very standard race condition
between those cool right

29
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:52,099
at the six players and those who produce
operation ceases and people

30
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:56,700
who try to alright d-texas exploits
confirmed you will be making his

31
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,559
of America texan's the centrists Cheryl
Cole

32
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:04,029
in our operating systems is not going to
be executed so simply

33
00:02:04,029 --> 00:02:07,340
because unlevel of OS

34
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,020
we see

35
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,070
more and more complex the

36
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,580
defense mechanisms form exploiting

37
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,200
errors of memory it well firstly the

38
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,140
stake in a race as they are called the
simplest one listen more I'm

39
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,490
they calculate some should around them
I'll value

40
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:32,240
which artist with in a stack it before
the registers that being so when

41
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,780
exiting the for sure this shootaround
Impala is stored in the area

42
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,250
of data some plays when

43
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,610
eluding the cell function at this should
around involves our

44
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:47,080
cook compared to an if it's wrong one

45
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,790
the processed on it well everything
looks wonderful but this is not a

46
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,340
solution from show called because cussed
overall

47
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,660
right now in a way you can calculate

48
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,200
reply in the other like magic and the

49
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,420
find out about the Skokie ill prolly use
and i've seen situations where

50
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,170
this was sent last edited volume was
certain constant

51
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,510
that was used well you can rewrite this
kooky in India section

52
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,270
directly where you can intercept these
exception handler

53
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,720
because when you do determination a
process that first

54
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,370
saying dat been a system looks at

55
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,380
it tries to understand do we have a
certain real arrival

56
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,800
custom or handler if we r

57
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,740
able to rewrite it and then we can
executions the show cause our goal

58
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:42,000
gold or reality exception

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,570
processing show course what time it is a
petition which

60
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:49,700
a lot less it to discovering those
things instead of state protection which

61
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,980
I to protect the exception the

62
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,670
a secure so what is the way around not
to use SCH

63
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:59,140
basic splits which are looking at
rewriting this acceptance

64
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,020
and a final merger in their obligation
that he's been compiled

65
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,020
without its relation all this flak safe
ch

66
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:10,270
and that is going to be executed in
addition to that

67
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:14,610
ate some very popular right now to the
logic beautiful memory

68
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,870
so the raid

69
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,720
executions take the train to the
execution of the a stack

70
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,520
the essential realization service
protection the hardware realization that

71
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,449
his protection

72
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:28,510
and namely this officials program
problem for the processor

73
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,010
is a Rep show called said that

74
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,050
I'm gonna speak about in this
presentation well

75
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,419
what does media here to be older

76
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:41,790
militias excluded from the setup
ligament

77
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,850
the variables and legitimate core pieces

78
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:49,229
and we'll tell you in more detail that
lied about and right now

79
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:52,520
in Prussia get all seasons die means of
protecting your

80
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,270
organization up memory of the address
space and processes States

81
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,910
piles and everything else but
nonetheless

82
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,449
this asking to get around because you
can find some are vulnerabilities which

83
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:04,860
can disconnect these

84
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,750
mechanism protection or will defined out
more complex

85
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:15,229
vander of attack or apply rock show
calls Rep show courts

86
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:18,419
return oriented programming

87
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,669
Regina really a problem as a soldier
allows to

88
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:25,330
get around certain defense a certain
make install member defense

89
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:30,130
and level the operating system and once
again we

90
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,240
be older are malicious caught out the
set of

91
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,690
illegitimate goes out of season
libraries and functions which are

92
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,650
present in the

93
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:42,070
Dodgers space optics cable process for
example the simplest

94
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:46,630
shell Cordier the ship similar type lead
to leap

95
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:53,060
it this in this Dec we in this case we
don't pollute at the malicious coach

96
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:58,099
mistake we put a number of addresses
wage transfer the control to for example

97
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:02,090
a function which exists somewhere in our
system for example we transfer the

98
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,139
controlling the sponsor

99
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:07,169
we have recorded its arguments into this
tag down well dysfunctions been which

100
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:07,820
earned

101
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:13,289
we disconnect not executable steak and
then we can transfer control

102
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:18,250
about called executed more complex

103
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:24,560
more complex process of building such
programs

104
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,289
without years each of return the season

105
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:31,499
functions as a rock show court so what
is needed we have a certain set of Gotch

106
00:06:31,499 --> 00:06:37,080
its gadgets are very limited set of
instructions

107
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,469
before the lead instruction system the
lab respect before ret

108
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:45,389
then put a number on the dresses and
assist ructions instructions to which

109
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:46,840
you have to transfer the control

110
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,120
and when the river's been called we your
report from the state the Anderson next

111
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,490
instruction don't four

112
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:57,719
for this small pieces of system library

113
00:06:57,719 --> 00:07:00,840
functions before the return address

114
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,449
will have the militias cause bales and
that's how it works and in the previous

115
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:06,719
example it was the same thing

116
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:10,069
we still the address and we store the
out its functions

117
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:13,180
well

118
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,189
proximate example

119
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:20,139
how the rock show called waybill will
look at which was built from

120
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:23,509
look-see library small gadgets

121
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:26,849
before its own function than we transfer

122
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:29,930
the address but this guy JIT week
executed

123
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,669
with the argument Rep function pools did
next address

124
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:37,879
direct action walls the Nexus balance
the speaking

125
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:41,759
as for the mean self discovery abrupt
show-cause evan is very

126
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,430
bed from this point of view because a
with additional show-cause

127
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,740
we have figured out how to fight and we

128
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,909
X ABC special courts and arm

129
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:55,009
show cause we can discover that we have
another study commanders

130
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:59,389
number of the net it matter its but than
40 show courts today

131
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:05,259
is a big headache for a bus and for the
industry and for researchers

132
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:09,729
and a are several millions which are
trying to solve these problems some

133
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:13,789
but day

134
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:17,669
can they do have certain deficiencies in
speculators efficiencies

135
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:20,960
lives there in that position because he
is a comparison and this is which would

136
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,139
be compared us matters

137
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:27,039
is a type of analyses XO until double
analyses XO

138
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,210
analysis which is not

139
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,459
in the forming the executable process
into analysis

140
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:34,900
when we it will be

141
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:39,559
into the analysis on the completion
process and then we get inside of the

142
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,080
process that will try to protect

143
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,060
the methods of analysis that can be
static day can be dynamic

144
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,140
possibility of tracing love the
essential protected

145
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,440
and the necessity of in the initial
called all the

146
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,660
debugging information well briefly I
would like to tell you how this methods

147
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,110
look like exam does it matter

148
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,700
microbes can what scattered dawes

149
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,640
simulation up the code execution

150
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,640
in other words it means

151
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,290
because this will be dice itself its a
beanie

152
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:17,210
he's a kid in a virtual environment at
the same time we do you create certain

153
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,480
for a bike window and we do Luke out are

154
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,630
incoming both for as an incoming data
and damn

155
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:27,160
were sliding in a 4-byte went on the
procession for the first gadget which

156
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,440
can be the first

157
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,700
and torie gadget interruption court so
we're looking at the set

158
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,980
or valid addresses also we have
discovered this fast gadget

159
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:39,590
in a statistical analysis we start in
relation to its execution

160
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:43,460
on the results of the election relations
will look at how many times did we hear

161
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,650
the address space

162
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,550
of the ballot addresses many times when
executed the red function

163
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,710
and in the same articolo we have a shown

164
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:58,650
big researcher from plenty of how have
any

165
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:03,130
transitions should there be a to the let
in gadgets in the malicious

166
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:08,040
programs are Chocolat in the set of a
random data so in the random data assets

167
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,660
win naber be able to see a4 sequential

168
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:16,110
transfers and read instructions for
sequential transfer so

169
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:20,110
Dez is a streak to threshold

170
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:25,110
for the discovery four arrests

171
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,850
the DeWalt its another metal today said
it would look

172
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:31,920
Dane am a clear for certain court which
looks I

173
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,610
as a rock show cause and then will
transfer it into shell court which

174
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:40,959
doesn't use rolled so they basically a
translator laying bleach

175
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,350
they translate this software in a soft
which doesn't

176
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,730
EU doesn't use Roop them to give

177
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,610
the existing core to the analyzers
unceasing

178
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,800
rock show cause our weather 86 processor
or RAM

179
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,589
process or any ending of so if on some
militias and somebody else should do it

180
00:10:58,589 --> 00:10:59,089
for you

181
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:02,180
well the

182
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:08,750
Rep stop Mets its Molly and this is just
a legal analyses

183
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:13,339
goal-setting analysis according to
protect the problem we

184
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:17,620
builder and 8 automation ovitz all
possible conditions and how the software

185
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,720
should be secured

186
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,420
then we will be there the graph all for

187
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,750
that instructions flow management floor

188
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,880
by these abrasions trees are being
developed and then after these

189
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,760
we did in the nation in executions for
and militias data and

190
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,160
suspicious they've it with a deviation
from the mean well that was built in the

191
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,899
evening then

192
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:44,350
as against once we stop execution juror
comments

193
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:48,420
well it's a very complex on the screen
but basically speaking about it

194
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:55,800
by static analysis we search for a
possible gadgets

195
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,850
and analysis goes on the bases of

196
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,130
which possible number of instructions
are

197
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,890
present in the gadget in addition to
that

198
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:10,329
we have noticed that in legitimate
programs after trust or from read

199
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:12,529
instructions we can go two totally
different

200
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:17,060
Aires memory in other words when we
speak but drop show court that we have

201
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,190
are not localized

202
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:21,269
only one library or in one limited

203
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:26,990
address space of the executable process
early cause a rupture ok older

204
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,279
constructions a very

205
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:34,180
complex process and and nobody will jump
from one members based on myspace lol

206
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,459
the same way they're looking at the
distribution addresses after try

207
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:41,179
its first to read instructions so this
is the main trigger

208
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:44,449
the to 0 will it be a rock show called

209
00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:47,480
or Rob defender

210
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,720
it's the defense instrument which user
shadow stacking it allows it source

211
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,920
article: analysis we have to

212
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,819
look at the book for of a suspicious
data if the call instruction or any

213
00:12:59,819 --> 00:13:01,230
other instructions been called

214
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:05,559
after we ship possibly there will be a
possibility to pull the next address we

215
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:07,009
put into a shadow stack

216
00:13:07,009 --> 00:13:11,819
after these by static analysis is a when

217
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:15,819
the easy to Shin is happening we look at
the difference between the original stay

218
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:19,009
which is the under control over there
also called and

219
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:22,360
shadows stack the which show called

220
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,579
knows nothing about if they are
deviations between them down of Korea

221
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:26,589
said the process

222
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:33,309
is also halt on the slide you can see
results so far

223
00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:39,209
overview and a nombre world a
performance of some systems a

224
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:43,869
he's in the throughput capacity define
some systems performance is defined by

225
00:13:43,869 --> 00:13:48,059
how strongly the unless processes are
slowed up

226
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:52,429
slowdown so speaking about the yourself
first and second type

227
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:56,619
always look at these numbers very
skeptically at because a

228
00:13:56,619 --> 00:14:00,959
well this is what others say and for the
Chocolat sample they have been provided

229
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,069
to us and they've been analyzing this is
true

230
00:14:03,069 --> 00:14:06,230
speaking about otherwise they have not
analyzed

231
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:13,470
yet letting well I'll give floor to
Yvonne right now and he's going to tell

232
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:13,809
you

233
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:17,170
Bart what was Thomas work

234
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:20,759
Joe speaking well but there is also the

235
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,990
over your dad we have done we have
selected mean

236
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:27,189
deficiencies old existence means of
defense and this

237
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:30,189
or review has included on the doors
means of defense which don't require

238
00:14:30,189 --> 00:14:32,089
further analysis the

239
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:35,179
initial call to be protected from
because this property

240
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:39,589
is not acceptable in real practice so
let's go to the deficiencies

241
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:43,910
of dole's products that have been
overview the main group can't efficiency

242
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:48,270
is a fact that these system does not
looks at pages ok member

243
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,370
that were selected to the process with
the help of

244
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:55,230
and so our process as it was noted
before there's a lot technology is a

245
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,020
technology of memory production

246
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:01,540
so-called realization of a memory the
memory segments such as library stacks

247
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,490
or piles

248
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:06,110
are selected to the process advice so
the random addresses

249
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:10,560
in order to for the attack and not to be
able to define the location

250
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,830
in advance at the amount of time the on
methodologies getting around on the

251
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,400
cement its a protection and can make an
example for example in the program

252
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,980
the there's availability of memory leak
the attack

253
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,810
can exploit and discover the

254
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:30,500
address a certain library function by
using these address he can calculate the

255
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,170
shaved

256
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:35,070
and missus which the process was a
little certain library ladies

257
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:39,700
he can use this library as this source
for the rock show called addresses

258
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,680
which leads us to the situation it's
possibly to ride a show called which

259
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,550
will not be detected by rocks can system

260
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:50,420
the main deficiency oldie rope system is
the fact that

261
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:54,420
show called acquired after the
transformation

262
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,360
is not a pure a copy of shell court was
functionality was

263
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,920
defined by the given show called which
leads us to the politicians

264
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,150
in the US show called we may not use so
the specific techniques wage

265
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:09,280
are used in region show called and to
which

266
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,200
are the means of discovery of show
courts are reacting therefore

267
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:18,020
differ application of these techniques
we'll note lead us to

268
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,390
positive results the main divisions have
the systems like rub store

269
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:26,180
0 pin drop defender is that a problem
data discovery of the show got happens

270
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,490
only after 8 was

271
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,850
put into it entre space on the process
it's a good long process and in order to

272
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:34,350
show

273
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:37,870
stole the militias a ticket to the show
called The only way to stop it

274
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:41,390
is a halting the program there are four

275
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:45,090
these systems they could not be used in
the environment

276
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:49,270
which require Hyatt trial

277
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:52,550
resistance on this is also in our work
we have done analyses

278
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,910
existing rock show cause that were
discovered in

279
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:59,520
public exploit databases and special
generators

280
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,060
all drop show goes on the bases on this
analysis we have discovered

281
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:09,310
main signs of a rock show called ability
in the air

282
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:12,950
and they can be divided by steady go and
dynamic signs

283
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:16,720
well by the way I would like to make a
reference to our previous work because

284
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,490
the

285
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:21,490
mean official called discovery on which
we are working because I've lost necks

286
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:25,100
be so yes he is discovering show caused
by certain

287
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,280
assigned so we just got a show called on
the bases all will

288
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,690
searching in the floor input data sudden
sell-off signs

289
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:35,580
and as certain lines but we decided not
to get away from the CEDIA

290
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,090
with the city to complete this module
this

291
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:43,870
existing product so that's how without
trying to look for signs

292
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,990
a specific for show cause we share GE

293
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:53,460
differentiate them from legitimate
traffic and any other types of showgirls

294
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,270
so let's go and look at those sites 10
the city school signs

295
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:00,740
is availability a in the network traffic

296
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:05,560
so-called valid addresses other violet
addresses we understand addresses

297
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,720
which show to the pages festival

298
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,420
this given to the process and second
ball to the pages

299
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,480
bleach Eloisa to execute instructions
due to the fact that shell construction

300
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,000
called

301
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,750
he's been constructed of addresses of
God's its and their arguments in rock

302
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,370
show called will see the present solve
the sweater dresses been present because

303
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,240
those addresses

304
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,900
are addresses in this gadget on a which
a Russian Court has been formed

305
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,780
therefore

306
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:33,870
availability of this addresses in the
input data can sing elisa's

307
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:37,610
about a presence on the rock show called
the next article

308
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:40,950
but simple is the job addresses

309
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:45,140
which show too so called gadgets and I
will review that could catch it

310
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:49,610
is a certain sequence of instructions
available classes

311
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:54,120
and the sequence in which he is and that
by certain construction of transition

312
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:59,230
which can be a controlled a process by
the attacker one for this a process they

313
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:04,530
use in return instruction rat so we
Jesus ambled outer space on the process

314
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,720
and we search for the

315
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,230
gadgets then we deduct their

316
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:12,670
from the address a breach on certain
monks in Bali of the guys it and it

317
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,340
happens there arduous pays

318
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,240
he's been divided into gotcha intervals
therefore

319
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,090
in today that we can do this social
addresses which belonged to the even in

320
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:23,590
trouble

321
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:26,750
also like to point out one important
fact

322
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,370
lot every address which belongs to this
in trouble

323
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:34,730
is garages tress due to the fact that in
architectural X

324
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:39,720
86 the sizes of instructions are
different Jew and disassemble with the

325
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,180
area's

326
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,280
shoes direct instruction can become a
part of a sudden

327
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,610
on instruction which will lead us to the
situation that these

328
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:49,630
address will not be an address which
shows us

329
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:52,820
to the got shit so we have to check the
validity of these gadgets

330
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:56,240
let's go to dynamic

331
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,290
sides these signs are signs of rock show
whole

332
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:05,200
gonna be a Dr that excise I mean
analyzed by certain virtual environment

333
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,200
jubilation oprah's show called for
example want to the Dane Eric signs

334
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,380
is a sign of number of executed returns

335
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,320
that were executed during immolation and
returns we do understand

336
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,500
nombre of executed instructions

337
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,289
return which gate control to a certain
talent address

338
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:28,000
this number ok and described a number of
gadgets

339
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,419
that were executed June execution on
this web show got in other words

340
00:20:32,419 --> 00:20:36,500
first addressed cues control

341
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,840
to the first gadget that has been
executor DCI use it a lot and then it

342
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,700
returns to action

343
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,400
redirects this control to the chicken
got sick in other words we can calculate

344
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,240
how many of those returns were executed
and then we can put a certain threshold

345
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,280
in order to kinda wat in advance

346
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,720
grandpa so the court the meds dynamic
sign

347
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,990
is availability of system calls that
were done to an aviation

348
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:05,220
due to the fact that attacker meets

349
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,919
to control the attacked system he needs
to use

350
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:14,080
certain system sections therefore
bicycle solution simple solution will be

351
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,039
shaking a other number of system calls
that were done

352
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:22,610
do intimidation and I'm going to point
out that it is necessary to check

353
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,760
validity of

354
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,780
initialization those arguments on the
system calls what do you mean by that

355
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:32,289
for example beef wanna arguments on this
is incall

356
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:35,720
he's address damn it is necessary to
check that these

357
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,960
address was a I'll order to a given
process

358
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,150
them the same thing to arkansas every
system call has to be correct

359
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:47,070
these property should be checked it in
fact that

360
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:52,650
in data from the network traffic and
there can be addresses which

361
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:56,890
truthfully point to set the system calls
but at the same time they do not point

362
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:57,909
out cold

363
00:21:57,909 --> 00:22:02,460
which correctly will initialized
arguments so it's not rock show called

364
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,190
the next dynamic sign is

365
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:09,549
availability of attack return to the
library

366
00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:13,570
as we've said it previously the read to
library attack is an attack joined

367
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:14,299
breach

368
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,470
a return address has been re

369
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,830
recorded not to the show called address
but to the others have a certain library

370
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,520
function

371
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,870
withheld reach attack at was to get
around

372
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:29,700
the memory protection for example I just
gives control to their function

373
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,100
and mop breach celexa vulnerable process

374
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:37,530
gives a certain memory section where the
instruction can be executed

375
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:42,510
them the instruction is being called up
to be a cop instructions been called

376
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:45,900
it copies show called from stacked let's
get a stack

377
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,299
to endure along that section of memory
what is permitted to execute this

378
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:53,929
instruction and then China's first
control to it therefore

379
00:22:53,929 --> 00:22:59,179
by these starting Chocolat therefore the
sin-bin sign will be the fact that doing

380
00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:00,010
in relation

381
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:04,760
a certain your page was a separate note
which allows a

382
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,990
education and instruction and then
controlled the problem was a given to it

383
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:09,669
the same

384
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:14,380
is a related to already existing pages
because the show called can change

385
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:18,900
the axis rise to the existing pages and
therefore disconnect Aztec protection

386
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:23,780
recollect to tell you about the previous
work we have done

387
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:27,280
also will be brief blocked

388
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,309
I have already told you about that in
other words we have certain

389
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:34,760
setup detectors in size which are able
to discover

390
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:39,809
in the into dealer show court sides
weeeeee put them in a certain to Paula G

391
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:43,299
which allows us to effectively separate
legitimate traffic

392
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:46,390
from additionally militias 1 and this

393
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:50,520
December assign is the higher it's going
to be looking this topology

394
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,919
in other what's potentially my lash
malicious a show called or

395
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:58,270
a suspicious corn no suspicious it is
them

396
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:02,390
it will go to the more difficult it n to
suck each detector can tell you that the

397
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,100
sign

398
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:07,770
already is not executed as them it's not
a show called and then we just returned

399
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:08,710
giving gays

400
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:11,890
the package to the channel grievously

401
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:15,350
it has reduced as at the number of
auxiliary

402
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:19,720
course and computation complexity of the
system and the word that we do right now

403
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,280
with brush and got has been done in
Fremont the model

404
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:26,649
up the system Giamatti is we also have
realized I

405
00:24:26,649 --> 00:24:30,559
details of signs a show cause and we put
it in these general topology

406
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:36,549
deportees so that work we have developed
a

407
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:40,700
means of discovering show copy
networking traffic bestia

408
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,720
drug does demolishes on the network in
traffic on the

409
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,309
a little bro show coronet in order to do
this analysis it is necessary to have

410
00:24:48,309 --> 00:24:51,370
axes to the address space on the
vulnerable process

411
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:54,409
in order to be able

412
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:58,409
to reconstruct rock show quote from
incoming addresses and analyze it after

413
00:24:58,409 --> 00:24:59,450
was the first solution

414
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:03,340
that we discovered it was a simple
connection to the processes

415
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:08,169
a of a debugger and then reading on the
information would help our system called

416
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:08,820
the trace

417
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,169
after we have realized that we have
understood that

418
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:17,000
we have bagels Hillary performance
problems in the process a dime a dozen

419
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,340
analyze data and we have a lot of dozen
system call countries

420
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:24,330
and games this limitation to us
therefore it is necessary

421
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:28,370
to solve a problem all-pro riding our
system

422
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:33,000
with a direct access to the address
space all these vulnerable process the

423
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,559
first thing that comes to mind

424
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:40,940
is a direct copping a page on the
address space out the process

425
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,929
under control but the in solution do
certain limitations to the memory

426
00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:48,149
because protected process is getting a
lot of them

427
00:25:48,149 --> 00:25:51,289
and they can take a big part of the
operating memory

428
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:55,419
brain memory so copying on those pages
on this process will lead to even

429
00:25:55,419 --> 00:25:58,679
bigger overflow of the operating memory
therefore

430
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:03,600
and we came to a decision to copy these
pages with the help of

431
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,399
compound right technique what is this
technique is all about

432
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,730
the system call for work he uses it to

433
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:14,940
copy Andreas peace on the protected
process

434
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:19,230
of the pond process to a draw to process
the system called for

435
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:22,620
is not copping decide to space above
process immediately

436
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:26,200
idk opposite only page by page im only

437
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,419
when a certain price pages Heather

438
00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:33,090
right operations from so if we have a
beach which belong sup on

439
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:37,200
trusses system call for will copy to the
daughter one

440
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,960
but physically the stage wheel

441
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,920
ceased only the single-copy therefore

442
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,570
we have decided to use these to peak

443
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:52,160
the first solution was to use Linux
cooler

444
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,830
that will use processor of system of
four

445
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:59,280
process in order to be able to cover the
other process but we

446
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,920
have seen an obstacle I was a
microsecond process

447
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:07,630
because the system calls are executed
into I'm behind on a certain process

448
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:10,980
and a half surprises a system processor

449
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:16,170
executors shouldn't look under discover
the process to cover it looks at the

450
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,590
existing process to the con process
Muckross

451
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:21,910
therefore we decided to use the
technique robbery injection

452
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:26,860
in other words protected process is a in
them we'll all support

453
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:30,060
agent library way %eh joined load

454
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:35,870
Kohls before system called by the scope
is the protected process then removes it

455
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:37,350
itself from the or less

456
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:42,910
and returns the control to the protected
prices in a donor processor this library

457
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:46,530
a starts a process of tree creating the
in later

458
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:50,060
other was the emulator libraries been
loaded which is responsible

459
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:53,990
for the american obvious and inflation
abruption called after these did order

460
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,550
process

461
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:57,610
goes to sleep up until the moment

462
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:01,270
when did I become houses will be
required haha the

463
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:05,320
analysis on the input data is being done
the input data has been divided into

464
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,030
intervals

465
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:09,230
for by speech our recent memory size

466
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:13,930
and Asian this addresses is being
redirected to a static oh and dynamic

467
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,040
analyzers

468
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,520
for checking static analyses

469
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,010
be in is searching for the gunship to
breach

470
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:25,730
the input address is showing so the
gadget of the cold

471
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:30,000
which is part of the russian girl the
search is happening in three stages

472
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,670
and the 1st Asia we see the checking of
the religion begin address

473
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:38,130
so the address is being searched in Long
valid memory

474
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:44,620
this point we need to be able an early
stage to Kat it weighed addresses which

475
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:48,470
are not addresses of those gadgets
because that are not specified the

476
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,830
Polish memory

477
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:53,140
if the address of the checked validity a

478
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:57,480
is stupid and research for specific
memory page we shows to this address and

479
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,690
then given page

480
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:02,570
we do the search for gotcha to which
these addresses pointy

481
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:06,179
so let's look at this point in which
detailed in

482
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:09,519
order to be able to remove addresses
which

483
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:12,899
are not got shit addresses at the
early-stage we appeal to

484
00:29:12,899 --> 00:29:16,179
black and red tree of intervals on on
ballot members

485
00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:19,539
and the norm that memory we understand
addresses which

486
00:29:19,539 --> 00:29:23,019
either are not selected to the process
not going to burst or given

487
00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:26,850
but day don't allow the execution is so
sad because we need pages for the

488
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:27,380
gadgets

489
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:31,149
so ish into about he's given a certain

490
00:29:31,149 --> 00:29:34,230
know what it is read like tree and also
like to point out that

491
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:39,120
long volleyed not valid addresses well
we have more of those then that it

492
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,409
addresses though for

493
00:29:40,409 --> 00:29:43,880
this tree where Lord you go through

494
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,740
early death to the page in order to
understand that the address is not valid

495
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:51,019
and if the address is valid than

496
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:54,320
in the SOC treaties address will go to a
certain stage and then

497
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,730
after was bill and more complex analysis
will be applied in

498
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:01,409
order to discover page in the memory
which belongs to the process

499
00:30:01,409 --> 00:30:05,529
we also use the Red Lake tree but a
valid entre SES

500
00:30:05,529 --> 00:30:10,840
valid addresses are pooled a as Knowles
in the street and for every peach

501
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:15,299
in advance we to the Jesus amply and the
search for gadgets

502
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:18,600
these gadgets into balls are given

503
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:23,360
a to a certain chewy and in order to
tree and by these we can go to this tree

504
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,110
and discover to which gotcha to which
address blocks

505
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:30,909
possible that's a point out that guy
gence which follow one another without

506
00:30:30,909 --> 00:30:34,760
any pauses are united to single malt in

507
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,830
order to reaches reduce the number of
flaws in the tree

508
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:41,320
after this PC gadget has been discovered
then we check for the village

509
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,389
validity of the UN gadget as we've
pointed it out dip

510
00:30:44,389 --> 00:30:48,950
previously due to in the quality of the
sizes of the instructions in 8

511
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:53,580
26 instruction disassembly of a little
instruction can become a problem

512
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:57,570
some are the instruction equal
disassembled withdrawn shift

513
00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:01,409
in I once we have 24 every gadget that
will discover

514
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:02,980
we have towards studies

515
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:07,440
assembling and we have to check
availability of return instruction in it

516
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,919
and you can see couple examples

517
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:12,850
when the return instruction he's been
disassembled correctly

518
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:15,970
and given sequence of instructions
becomes gadget and

519
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:19,380
incorrect after this stage

520
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:23,710
of a static a little analysis we have
some information

521
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:28,740
bout which addresses are showing 2
gotcha addresses these addresses

522
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,770
are given true dynamic analyzer in

523
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:35,990
order for it to be able to analyze an
abortion could and analyzes behavior

524
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:39,270
due to the fact that we don't know in
advance which have the address is

525
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:43,890
will specified the first gadget
abruption gold in the nation begins

526
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:48,990
from each got shipp dude in the nation
we collect statistics about

527
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,299
operation ok work abroad show court on
the

528
00:31:52,299 --> 00:31:55,640
upon mister dynamic we collect
information about the

529
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,070
Danika Kohls assistant call sir

530
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:02,450
number execs you did to return it
russians highly detailed address is

531
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:05,650
to which they make transition and also
attacks

532
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:09,190
all for a return to library on the slide
you can see an example of the work on

533
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:09,820
the meter

534
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:14,390
left side you can see the stack way it
were the input data was introduced in

535
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,940
the in the red colour you see the

536
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:19,799
address so that has gushed from which
russian causes be studies didn't even

537
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:23,380
call as you see different arguments
which are being used for the ranges from

538
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,580
7 purple collar

539
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:28,240
its this %uh arguments for six goals so

540
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,140
after stages of static kill and dynamic
analysis

541
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:35,740
it becomes possible to localize packages

542
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:40,900
which store the a malicious and cold and
on the basis of this information

543
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:45,040
we can make decisions about removal of
these

544
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:49,270
malicious packages decision that we have
developed it was tested

545
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:53,510
I'm a test sample which consisted of
rock show called

546
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:58,059
and but surely did i do Russia
consolation was done other existing

547
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,000
broke so cold

548
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,919
wish were discovered in public export
data bases and show cause

549
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:07,340
which were generated with the help of
special generators a promotional codes

550
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:12,640
the testing shown us that for the
criteria errors on the first and second

551
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,090
tied

552
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:15,149
a system that was joke is no

553
00:33:15,149 --> 00:33:20,059
was then existing and knowledge is which
is awesome also we have done

554
00:33:20,059 --> 00:33:23,330
testing offer performance on the system
that was developed

555
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:27,859
as a protected processes we have
selected popular applications out for a

556
00:33:27,859 --> 00:33:28,570
service like

557
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:31,570
by changing sorghum is a CH forces kill
light

558
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:34,909
guessing of performance shown us that

559
00:33:34,909 --> 00:33:38,719
the system that was developed by us has
a more performance than existing

560
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:41,149
knowledge is in the images on this
legacy

561
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:45,359
the existing knowledge which he uses the
same title analysis the extant

562
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:49,769
mullis's so brief conclusions

563
00:33:49,769 --> 00:33:54,369
about the world at war we have developed
a system of detection approach so-called

564
00:33:54,369 --> 00:33:58,149
in high-speed networks these brother has
a

565
00:33:58,149 --> 00:34:01,629
number of advantages compared to the
existing technologies

566
00:34:01,629 --> 00:34:04,729
and among those analogies advantages are

567
00:34:04,729 --> 00:34:08,579
high speed of data processing
independence from the limits on the

568
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:10,510
source code to protect its program

569
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:15,230
ability on to discover rock show cause
which are getting around Islam

570
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:15,839
protection

571
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,899
and another advantage is a fact that to
prevent

572
00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:24,159
the vulnerable activities or broke so
called you don't have to

573
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,819
halt the program that has been executed
briefly I would like to

574
00:34:27,819 --> 00:34:31,750
least the main points on the one that
was not testable we've done analyses

575
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:36,200
with existing methods or rock show cause
systems and were discovered them and

576
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:36,990
efficiencies

577
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:41,869
also we've done analysis of the existing
rock show courts and generators

578
00:34:41,869 --> 00:34:45,109
those and basins analysis we have
selected main

579
00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:50,139
signs up a little drop show called in
network traffic this isn't the size

580
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:54,690
we have developed try little discovery
abruption court in network traffic

581
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:59,740
this product was tested real data well
that's it thank you very much for your

582
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:08,269
attention

583
00:35:08,269 --> 00:35:11,119
well if you have any questions lisas

584
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:20,280
on will answer

585
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,120
but expect

586
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:25,760
kills both nights a comment that you
believe but he's late evening in being

587
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,230
an

588
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:29,470
belated again another have to put the
thingy

589
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:32,820
people gene you've got the none the
people she knew mean

590
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,890
dealing it as a union tourist circuit
breaker

591
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:39,120
suppose crisis is too much %ah skate

592
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:43,850
for your brilliance model leader to
reproduce to lately

593
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:47,490
to New consuming for once was a crucial
to stay in your system the earlier a bit

594
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:47,790
slow

595
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:51,870
surpluses secret until it was a shit and
remembrances eco-tourism I just would

596
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:52,480
sit you

597
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,920
you they lived on the process if needed
to get sick again

598
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,530
tour religion diet it up the name
without them it similar to produce a

599
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:00,950
song

600
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,970
the most with the initial 3 in order to
be used

601
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:08,340
on its a post or john is a mute the
abuse

602
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:13,130
it's not required well only reading from
the outer space is needed

603
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:17,230
als the defendant process and due to the
fact that we use comin right technique

604
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:22,280
physically in the memory this address
space in the cell processes his presence

605
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,570
present only in one copy and it's not
being copied it's not been kinda due to

606
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,600
the fact that for the analysis we need
only

607
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:32,650
leading from the given beijos so these
leaders are being created

608
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:36,800
they have direct access to the address
space they don't have any delays for the

609
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,840
reading from the memory

610
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,880
in these processes are putting to sleep
until the moment

611
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,910
when we will need certain dynamic
analysis of until that moment

612
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:48,780
chief certain address will go to the
whole stage

613
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:53,740
of static analyses it will go through
the the validity of the gadget check

614
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:57,100
and only done he is a more complex check
is needed

615
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,310
the simulators will be started there at
the next question

616
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:05,720
for example beef hydrous space from a
process was able to change

617
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:09,890
after you have done a fork but before
the execution of the show called this

618
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,600
property also has been checked

619
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,160
an actual information is always been
updated so that the moment of time you

620
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,060
can remove the all-time leader in
creating

621
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:20,580
you want so you do too many Tory with
outer space yes we do

622
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:39,930
week definitely do thank you

623
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:44,760
unfortunately we have not

624
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:56,680
analyzed called traffic critic traffic

625
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:05,500
more questions

626
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:09,670
the question is not being asked into the
microphone therefore I cannot translate

627
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:16,060
what they can he can't hear we

628
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:19,800
don't do housing in this press release
starting the process is used by the

629
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,910
means which use internal analysis

630
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:25,050
so the analysis of the soaked bird
behavior

631
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:29,650
with a rock show call can be a part of
as we have shown in the overview the our

632
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:33,580
products which are getting connected to
the process they have certain moral of

633
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,050
the problem rations and a check for
deletion

634
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:41,680
our program catches dominant

635
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,860
level network catches dispatch packages
level network

636
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:50,070
so this package is are not even and
touring the predicted process

637
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:55,150
and bodies there is no necessity to
heart it's so we analyze traffic and we

638
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:57,820
analyze shell called on the process of
its own but

639
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,830
transportation and the staged by

640
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:03,920
she's been removed with the malicious
code

641
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,600
did you have any interesting false
positives and how you been fighting the

642
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,069
AIDS

643
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:14,150
with pulsed positives and now a rock
show cause there's a special popularity

644
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,140
because even all

645
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:18,620
existing means up discovers full
positives

646
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:22,230
are on little issue in this property
comes from the fact that

647
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:25,770
nombre of executed returns

648
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:28,840
is very strict threshold

649
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,970
for cutting away the belittle data we
have

650
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:35,760
cyl several researches before us which
shown us that

651
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,240
random data no more than four returns

652
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,690
returns which follow one another no more
than four so the sequence

653
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:47,130
of calls abruption cool gadgets no more
than four returns

654
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:50,630
that's why we do the threshold

655
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:54,450
so we speak about what month false
negatives for positives

656
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:58,720
in the rock show court cases it's very
easy to find due to this

657
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,640
is a single work much ask other people
most of the people here

658
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,180
the no certainty textures and

659
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:09,210
writing but what it was and you know
that is a simple erases

660
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:12,990
which can cut away and differentiate
legitimate traffic had some legitimate

661
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:16,200
I'd objects from knowledge into once in
our case will be speaking

662
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,560
how to fight against false natives

663
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:27,120
that's it equation

664
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,510
is not been asked into the like of so

665
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:35,020
I'd it depends on the number of garages:

666
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:38,450
that were discovered in a given process
the more gorgeous you have the more

667
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:39,550
probability is dead

668
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:42,860
given others will be in there least
discussions

669
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:46,550
I didn't hear the question

670
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:55,320
questions

671
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:59,080
them thank you very much for your
attention
