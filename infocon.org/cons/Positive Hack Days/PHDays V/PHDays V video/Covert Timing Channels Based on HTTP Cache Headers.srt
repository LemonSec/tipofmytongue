1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,399
you rural and inner-city is somewhere in
siberia

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:07,120
I'll talk about to convert Charles
through the

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,550
share channel so patients people have
okay it sounds great

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:17,810
sold report is going to be about

5
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,330
shown it to find out what is that first

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,449
personal was the converter no is anyway

7
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:28,070
love communication through any mechanism

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,980
which was not intended for that good
channels

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,070
car

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,980
are timing

11
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,040
chance and

12
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,120
memory channel so member is the channel

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,790
reach use member Andy Kurt timing

14
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:54,760
when we get certain irregular behaviour
system and we

15
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:00,400
prospective information there also in
the heading there was the age to be

16
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,180
political of course color channels

17
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,850
it's more interesting for us to realized
through the

18
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,610
network to host but this British is it
is one of the most use

19
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,909
have a protocol that's why it's
interesting to find

20
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:16,710
cover chills down the spine also the
founder figures at the end

21
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,979
now rich perchance nations we should
give about

22
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,020
to bits per second person capacity

23
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,690
this fight would be interesting to check
whether it is true or not

24
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:32,979
also research or something

25
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:35,850
Burton wish to be will find

26
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,600
the shows on the lower levels I P

27
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:47,130
to spin so

28
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,740
through found out wat are the cushions

29
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,490
why you needn't needed to passed through
something

30
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,280
to the could be some commands controls

31
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,200
some reason but not runs on the to some
browsers

32
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:10,060
talk about beef for work could be
cryptographic keys

33
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,700
key exchange or

34
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,730
it could be used to transfer any illegal
content.

35
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:21,890
so now in the cassette headers

36
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:26,300
her to them modified

37
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,320
attack and request

38
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,760
headers why we need them if we have

39
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,920
large beach with the big picture
returned the update page

40
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,780
don't want to float page again that's
why we can use the

41
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,040
picture can are heather's

42
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,900
well

43
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,400
we also use such ideas like
client/server

44
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,080
channels missus bassett things in they
didn't do anything client is more

45
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,900
activity

46
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,790
Sant quests and silver can respond

47
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:06,680
espy per chance client/server

48
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:13,299
easier to implement if client wants to

49
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:15,470
server needs to interpret it somehow

50
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,299
and from server to client channels are
more complicated than

51
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,549
most to them time and channel so it's
more interesting

52
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:35,310
to research

53
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:35,720
so

54
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:42,200
in order not to be that blank

55
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,300
let us for example hope that are

56
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,690
here befriends request Heather looks
like the following requests

57
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:55,300
take the Heather attack you cannot

58
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,760
shooter well with the pointer its
classical Part

59
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,950
attack under nunn-lugar information and
write it and we have the

60
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:08,540
client quickly sends a request to the
circus information

61
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,260
so

62
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,230
than last but if I response header

63
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,299
whose the

64
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:24,130
okay with the red contains data the last

65
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,560
change that riddle for months

66
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,120
attack good com more complicated
complaints for information

67
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,750
it concludes descriptor his document the
size

68
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:41,610
time Harper size format

69
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,430
the work something like that client is
asking

70
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,729
as page changed sources

71
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:51,430
yes okay go ahead parks 304

72
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,449
didn't change whose

73
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:57,970
second headers you have the

74
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,340
soon version as previous or not

75
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,099
and the services I don't know you okay
we have

76
00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:08,590
got the basic ideas and that's

77
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,919
basics QC what needs to be done to

78
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,099
manpower her chance look scary but

79
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:19,419
for simple fun side we have think it's
you

80
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:23,759
use this thing particular from yourself
from your left

81
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,039
hidden message that you want to sent

82
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,729
we have two processors taker one

83
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:34,190
decade too much thicker one launched
sent some information

84
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,460
sry message to take a to it's wise to
use

85
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,789
page pages to mount which store to

86
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:44,479
web server in the middle news red

87
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,659
dotted line is the trust border

88
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:52,190
with internet persons are simple

89
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:57,060
to send information to use page in the
middle most important to observe

90
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,289
we have to scenarios American

91
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:03,430
lies are hidden channel promotional
first

92
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,719
minimal requirements now this file

93
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:09,820
the secret message all

94
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:14,070
attacker one should lose reduce correct
information and

95
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,280
change timor-leste success to patient

96
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,039
attacker to must just have access to
paid to see whether to change in our

97
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:24,240
had a scenario

98
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,030
so called full control our web server
was

99
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,940
computer requests last strong but for
simplicity sake let us consider the

100
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,349
situation with the attacker

101
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:37,770
cool a control group or get some bonuses
on over

102
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:46,930
and future implementation realization
was proposed

103
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:50,400
as score channel scheme decker to

104
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,310
has patients per request to that page

105
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:59,250
it is used using the cursor headers

106
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,659
understand sweater clothes changed
person tho not and then

107
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:07,750
makes up his mind whether it would be
was received

108
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:13,150
remember that many shaders and we can
separate tolley

109
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,710
cover chance two groups last modified
based on

110
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:22,130
it at least everything his channel scan
which I mentioned on a different saying

111
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:22,729
is that

112
00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:26,650
they're using different thing said in 25
weathered page has changed not

113
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,520
is channels clean we see the

114
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,409
Heather otherwise we'll look at the a
shit to Pico status

115
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:38,370
okay everything simple to realize see
what's

116
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,889
in rats maybe it's pure was hearing
nothing works

117
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:45,979
so far we have come close classical
problems

118
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:50,639
but the color channels in time known
interesting thing you can say

119
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,789
is that classic for channels

120
00:07:54,789 --> 00:08:00,150
network but I'm use special package
called and a friend which allowed to

121
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,360
synchronize writing reading process

122
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,389
the managed to do without them not

123
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:10,280
reducing the best to pursue a career
chose for the specimen this package

124
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:16,139
accuse combination dynamic back to sleep
combination process makes a request and

125
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:16,870
CEO

126
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,120
a could have slept for to sex

127
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,750
on asap 1/2 so

128
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,280
that's why you have high in simplicity

129
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,870

130

posts experiment plus 15 channel
remember

131
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,970
stores time the person up one second
that's why I'm

132
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:44,260
passenger buses just 1-meter have a bit

well with without an error minimal have
percent guaranteed sized information to

136
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,090
the distortion

137
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:03,400
as you can see it's now for
cryptographic key

138
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,939
you can use it all the notes PD

139

it sends okay start on impressive

142
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,570
let's take a look at the texts similar

shareholders by default now averages
have a second one sack

153
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,960
not a for us to use it more effectively

154
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,900
to have quick update to to share

155
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:09,000
channel need to think which server needs

156
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,620
better accuracy of course file hosting

157
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:17,519
mister to sink about file host songs and
we have seen that many

158
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,040
a house it's like Google Drive Dropbox
in others

159
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,910
have their own FBI isn't that we can

160
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:28,089
change file sir get information about
them

161
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:31,490
Sat that's why we can get that happy on

162
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:36,360
have two processes the Packers had
passed Google driving through that

now said

167
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,009
this bit is much better we can do
something about it and we use

got hidden channel which anonymous

00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,340
looking for many angle we can

100 requests looks like dude

178
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:44,700
any user would be the same

179
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,410
we use the functionality labs

180
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:51,410
standard what's important no

they will work even if the server list

00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:29,300
john is a set lever said the scenario

191
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,670
second security contacts we

192
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:38,300
are we got credo that bass
organizational took so many efforts we

193
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,020
can wait for rations request and

194
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,260
apply respectively

195
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:48,370
than best bestie goes up get his bid for
a request

196
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:53,810
turn came they have realized that got
Bertone digital ocean

197
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:57,820
this land had phoned I mentioned on

198
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:03,290
now I can use local nightcore time looks
great done

199
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:06,500
and Internet I missed sexes

200
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,690
much better than what we have seen very
beginning

201
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:14,029
but like tube is sent them

202
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:17,000
so great what we have in the second
scenario have

203
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,120
again cover

204
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:25,209
channel on DA should it be hatteras
doesn't change the structure

205
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:30,339
it to look where logical

206
00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:33,879
and again it looks like something
comparing the page in maint

207
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:38,310
its easy to realize and implement and
spice quicker

208
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:42,560
my working use that and never used that
we have

209
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,629
realize that with the beef module wanted
to see how r

210
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:51,079
core channel works beef is a framework
to

211
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:59,949
test 100 clients so when the I

212
00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:01,180
is perot browser

213
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:06,040
for JavaScript code so what we have
placed let them and then

214
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,829
synchronization functions and into the
particle had to find out

215
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:13,459
we couldn't do that forward first model

217

was a well-controlled web server nothing
extraordinary here

219
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,480
it's easier for skit synchronized user

to know find out pastures and marriages
their

221
