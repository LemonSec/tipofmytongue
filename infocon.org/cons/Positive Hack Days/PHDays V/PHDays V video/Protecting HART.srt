1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,060
my name is reveal

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,610
I am a student are the physical
adversity in moscow

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:16,119
physics University Moscow and such to my
report is defensive Harbor Cole

4
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:19,550
I'll take your time he was but my
objective the objective is to

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,160
is searching for upon our bird is as it
should be

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,740
and develop the hardware to

7
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:31,269
if I am logged the malicious activities
so

8
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:36,330
in my presentation the mission was to
research department call analyze the

9
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:40,750
vulnerability said that but I called and
a research the concept %uh

10
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:46,399
the security nasa tip be for overtime
but the hard part a call i wud

11
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,850
told her about the if

12
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,700
all

13
00:00:54,700 --> 00:01:01,240
prime okay

14
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,400
search for for an analog signal in the
field I was also dismayed digital

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,630
signals so

16
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,220
that's how we had about the hard product
called this the industrial ditch told

17
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,460
product called

18
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:18,370
I to transmit digital signal based on
their African see modulation so in other

19
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,310
words

20
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:23,150
old there's the combination

21
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,320
are the transmission but the different
frequencies

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:34,240
him so properly herds this logical unit
and logical 0 another such go on

23
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,750
and logical one is

24
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,900
12 hurts so this can be directly
connected to

25
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,910
do it

26
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,780
to leading devices and made a medium
level

27
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,380
and the first leading lead denies

28
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:59,409
is the usual

29
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:01,530
PO came the other is hard mode am

30
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,520
the war at the Selcuk

31
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,000
containing the part protocol devices

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,190
it

33
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,670
the second connections to the lead to
living devices

34
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:21,590
it you can get up to fifteen different
lead devices said

35
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:26,480
then Megan Smith only digital signal
here and the analog signal

36
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,660
his ease to power the

37
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,860
trackers so this product call as
vulnerable

38
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:41,470
old

39
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,950
his such as

40
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:53,019
the software vulnerability hip

41
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:58,040
cause the failure of the and the failure
thus up for a room with this specific

42
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,099
art product called

43
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:04,370
and also there was a vulnerability out
there a server with heart so if

44
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:09,400
there's still wrong IP header their a
hard the RPS server could fall

45
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,420
meal the other Wilner ability

46
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,349
Pierce that that the

47
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:20,670
put on the acrid low evidence could the

48
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:24,489
rutile India a sensor or replace the
sensor

49
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:30,280
world

50
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,400
so it the device is giving the

51
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:45,980
wrong I T and he had near

52
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:53,080
a.m. vulnerabilities that we need is
done we know that

53
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,730
is his

54
00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:01,129
the system is now pitting DMS system so
for that we can use

55
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:15,770
world

56
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:20,660
used

57
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,320
hit sweet but there's a

58
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,750
our DT TM technology integrated it works

59
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:33,030
I am following way: and space in
containers Inc com Content urs income

60
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,740
objects

61
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,900
and integration the interaction have
space on XML messages so all the

62
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,090
information

63
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:47,610
that we have in the sensor holes

64
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,910
its packages into the expectation TX
email message

65
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:55,350
and as a result him we

66
00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:00,120
heaved it did

67
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,740
if this century's I swapped

68
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,940
Canon dad special to inject a cement Co
there also are

69
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,310
certain vulnerabilities I

70
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:17,440
who would I in the military level and
ninety where users can urs cannot

71
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,610
protect that so would-be

72
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,370
want to do out the hard way that would
protect other three levels so that by

73
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:27,940
the nation

74
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:32,890
also who have three important points to
technological security

75
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:36,580
humor the specialist simple act

76
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,340
technical information technological
information from

77
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,290
the objects and sensors security at the
production

78
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,650
this for the special school manage the
production

79
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:52,420
and this option would be important to
give for

80
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,020
here we get information about the
problems that would appear if

81
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,560
a in the case have said to be and the
the

82
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,800
the third thing is of course IT security
yes

83
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,810
PA security instances and of course
there

84
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:11,310
directors also that world

85
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:15,240
so the hardware the said we have certain
modules

86
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:21,350
to analyze at the physical level sold

87
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:26,190
which below to control fictional
physical

88
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:30,630
features at the signal who'll

89
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,310
his his

90
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,660
make smile is the frame analyzes who

91
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,610
will be able to analyze the structure
%uh the transmit pictures base in the

92
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,180
frames

93
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,450
and find the violations over the loud
format there's a

94
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,580
model a utiliza comments

95
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:59,520
the data transmission who

96
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,500
weekend initially said this scenario no

97
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,700
with that and have fun the work happens
now cordis area that can be identified

98
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,190
of course

99
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,650
basic on their abilities would like to
find on their bills before

100
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:18,380
they have been exploited to shit

101
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,029
it

102
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:23,899
feel a protection is basin make free air

103
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:29,839
lead trance information basic current
network will be able to

104
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:35,129
the friggin sick a portrayed preach
signal

105
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:38,669
and will have the mile for each signal
and certain

106
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:42,189
a thresholds and gave

107
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:47,219
the frequency will be swabbed will me
will be able to identify dat

108
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:52,009
so now little were developing here

109
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:56,319
the the models them

110
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,750
the hardwood warrior the controller used

111
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,780
and will be making new firmware and
testing

112
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,580
in the near future
