will go some deep dicking

17
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:17,540
him to the ideally and some

18
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,979
haiti is which really work

19
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:24,249
I will show you about two things

20
00:01:24,249 --> 00:01:28,740
to which I a dedicated my presentation
help locating

21
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,009
which is in station development in the
final stages developed

22
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:37,549
transferring the messaging results

23
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:41,359
and some automated calling

24
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:46,359
policies well first would like to tell
about 26

25
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:50,079
due to the fact that I'm not teaching

26
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,799
because the last year's my lecturing
scales

27
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:57,119
of for once

28
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,479
so please don't think bad about being a
second thing because

29
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,689
I'm involved in redress

30
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:08,459
engineering of the area s controller its

31
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,740
hardware firmware

32
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,120
police are ates

33
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,940
which

34
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,360
happened in the cause of last year when
they started

35
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:26,050
working with these in great detail so

36
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,150
previous works first

37
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:33,140
I'm based in the previous Years War
which was sick

38
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,180
reverse engineering automation lectures

39
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,450
an ATS which I had in the course of all
time since my

40
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:45,450
I asked these and

41
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,790
right now I realize them with different

42
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,410
before so wasn't difference between

43
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,020
reverse engineering of for worse from

44
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,260
regular aiseesoft message

45
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,520

tix usually

47
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,830
binaries or really small size

48
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:15,770
called is very same 0 as a rule not
external operating system for such

49
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:19,959
devices for such hot things everything
is in bill inside worked with the

50
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:20,820
equipment

51
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,390
and more external goals or

52
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:29,530
ATI's and operations if you work with
the side were for the first time the

53
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,030
only thing that can help you

54
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,260
is some signature s

55
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:39,150
he died lead and library signatures

56
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,470
might help you what is the RFQ

57
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,489
T to compile

58
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:48,660
except X 86 exit

59
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:55,190
64 also works for arm for other
controllers it's not operational

60
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:59,770
practically down more in leaders in to
buy garish

61
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:04,060
later switch our existing once like kale

62
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,220
in the innovation mold de Boer

63
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,020
for you namely with blogs inch a tad
more old

64
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:17,320
if g-voice if you was able to connect
the device

65
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,020
and

66
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:21,550
able to work with it they also

67
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:26,570
do not work very well so in other words
when you look at all these

68
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:31,580
you're the only way all sit down in
steady since I love the ID and jazz

69
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,780
T inside as a rule

70
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:39,120
well not going to speak with issues like

71
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,240
how deed we take the stomp

72
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,060
we're not going to speak about any
architecture problems but will speak

73
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,450
about it

74
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:51,580
Chevrolet don't contains several things

75
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,680
usually is the main

76
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,960
entry point when you hit reset handler

77
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,450
than interrupt lecturers

78
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,590
in different areas the did control as
they have them

79
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:10,840
different allocated the one that I've
been working we

80
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,660
it starts with this year address then we
have a system look law order

81
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,770
which prepares I love these data
application bootloader

82
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,780
which showed boats the notification then

83
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,810
main functionality obligation there
could be

84
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:31,620
a interrupt the handlers

85
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,080
but some of them don't need it and can

86
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,290
some in vitro routines

87
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,750
like can boss

88
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:46,350
I'm not going to give you at least at
least this welders lot such lease

89
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,930
in the gym comport war UART or some

90
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:55,010
other things like that networking card
right now there's a lot of devices

91
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:58,970
device contains a lot of things and of
course there's also areas

92
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,100
in the

93
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,340
random access memory areas showing it be
resource for which

94
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,900
area which memory

95
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,940
areas are responsible for which devices
speak

96
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,280
and of course problem that II chased

97
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,480
that show spent a lot of time each
valuable time

98
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,720
Hugo walk around ministry run and jump

99
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,390
what you see do reverse issuing days and
weeks

100
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,850
you have reversed if you look at the
damn things wonderfully a look at the

101
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,080
operating system you

102
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,590
she worked with peachy what it does
itself

103
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:44,330
you didn't cue cool yes your call

104
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,250
but nobody later update

105
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:53,220
was produced for these device for
firmware and your results

106
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,240
are in the previous

107
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,290
defile but should be done with it menu

108
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,800
if you want to translate well it's not
an option hugh

109
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,150
find yourself in a similar situation the
sky what can I do it

110
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,910
soul let's

111
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:15,130
try to generalize what are these

112
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:19,340
are be resource reverse aging results I
divided into four parts

113
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,640
in court nation functions global or
local labels

114
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,860
procedure are spread absent captains

115
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,140
and comments very often some

116
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,530
intermediate auction in the data

117
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:39,000
names of global local variables

118
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,280
a function arguments variable types and
comments

119
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,530
then met enough

120
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:50,190
structures and enumerations structures

121
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:54,360
social member a switch on screen
comments and also

122
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,090
where the circus show showing or due to
the fact that

123
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:05,040
Jerry of data sheet for saddam
controller

124
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,220
or four sound device is not compatible
with that

125
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,580
options distribution segments which

126
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,730
are given to you regime and you do it
manually

127
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:21,100
or with the help of some small streets
you corrected you correctly segments it

128
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,009
very often

129
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:25,949
if he does it in such a way so that
functions I'll

130
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:30,639
well functions are improperly
incorrectly defined you also have the

131
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,759
correct I love the San

132
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,789
respectively somehow you should look at
the

133
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:38,479
massive so variables must structure is
so

134
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,969
the SES our result regular way

135
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:46,290
when you have

136
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,110
Dom it to be fall

137
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:54,069
cousteau worked type of information

138
00:08:54,069 --> 00:08:57,720
and that amazing UTC Fire & down

139
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,389
stripped it down the toilet and you
start it

140
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:04,810
executed but it has a number of problems

141
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,399
the faster the main one it doesn't work
on

142
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:15,029
different because it is connected to
some addresses in the second trial in

143
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:15,790
which insists

144
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:20,029
that even on the same down binary file
it's not working correctly

145
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:23,279
due to though staying stack we

146
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,069
have discovered as a consequence of the
structural

147
00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:33,759
differences something

148
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:40,299
out of everything that is available at
least what I was able to see

149
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:45,699
what similar functionality can talk to
Joe there's a plugin

150
00:09:45,699 --> 00:09:49,279
mind eight tries to

151
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,629
take function and export damn

152
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:56,040
into Clauss functions matcher

153
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,360
set functions measure it collects the

154
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,379
this close and uses for it flow chart
and

155
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:08,239
from the basic blocks CLECs a certain
want it see

156
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:12,579
of the spots the shits

157
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:16,160
in its own name like unscripted stalled
and

158
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:22,470
this notes are basic blocks than it has

159
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,179
edges which links between basic blocks
also it has

160
00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:30,549
the concept called points once upon a
time I can

161
00:10:30,549 --> 00:10:34,920
looking for this difference between this
and this edges from

162
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,189
boyd's honestly speaking I forgot this
different spot

163
00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:41,579
understand it's a sign of all alt and

164
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:46,529
in coming weeks outgoing and incoming
search and this is very close to the

165
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:53,189
previous one seriously

166
00:10:53,189 --> 00:10:56,910
minute bender instructions just Sharma

167
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:00,009
all instruction 6 other this function
inside

168
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:03,129
who basic blocks so

169
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:07,149
bot we are able to do with it in its
oriented for

170
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:10,579
X 86 most likely maybe

171
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:13,749
X 64 and and that kept

172
00:11:13,749 --> 00:11:18,350
to download it into on or other process
or controller has led us to the

173
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,549
situation that's creates Python streets

174
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:24,139
just didn't start so we came to the
conclusion that

175
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:28,290
it also dependent and this wasn't a
problem

176
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,589
of many existing scripts they

177
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:35,199
all are oriented at certain

178
00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:36,290
tasks

179
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,290
and they are tuned up for controllers
all the process

180
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,760
specific ones usually for PC soft

181
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,260
less of them for of Gary

182
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,760
often to search for script reader so

183
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,760
use just

184
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,650
tax representation of there's
instructions hairy moles

185
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,860
said name registries they look at it

186
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:05,990
as a text until

187
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:10,240
in or often sometimes the use

188
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,100
jester initialed by itself instructions

189
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,240
to search for certain patterns

190
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,740
and come to some conclusions its

191
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,030
we function

192
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:33,460
internet it's a function form

193
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,680
prologues 8 tries to find

194
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,670
those functions that ID deified for

195
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:45,110
let's look here 8 just takes

196
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:48,470
and for it a Logitech sure it looks for
the bite

197
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:51,620
which represents these two particular

198
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:57,740
commands it's not going to work and

199
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,460
anything else pocket am

200
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:06,120
here are the requirements how would like
to see

201
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,390
at the moment of

202
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,600
work beginning these are the
requirements that we

203
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,600
should have display ID

204
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,120
Python everything is very simple in

205
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,330
order for it to be independent from
architecture

206
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:27,100
and should have any connections to the
accession process or and controller

207
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,450
welder should be said exceptions in the
future but these

208
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:34,150
are things which can be tuned up down
certain

209
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:38,550
information got to be sorry you simplest
ways to get basic info

210
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:45,210
and you simplest ways to extra few
information

211
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:48,130
I started this work approximately

212
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,640
1 year ago previously

213
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,240
I did love reverse engineering

214
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,370
but usually I I did a lot of screeching
so

215
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:03,990
this ish

216
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:07,670
somewhat my experience that I'm trust
into you of

217
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:11,260
getting information by message so we
will use the following

218
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,840
damn solve the problem controllers and
usually

219
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,500
they are mostly related to Kos

220
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,270
other what industry this our control
this

221
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:25,600
first 3 are parts of

222
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,140
engine control unit of different

223
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:34,580
vehicles and you can find all these
firmwares

224
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:38,700
internet and download them soap

225
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,360
we need to do the first thing we need to
get some basic information

226
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,780
the simplest one

227
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:54,970
everybody knows about it if you have
done skating

228
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:59,430
ever in your life first you need to get
X references

229
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:04,530
cross-references and

230
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:11,339
you will see some simplified examples in
my presentation for the sake of

231
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:12,540
presentation of course

232
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,770
first so dishes told

233
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:21,140
which is given to two different commands

234
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:25,290
two different addresses to reference

235
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:28,440
was in really slow its

236
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,620
for generates a cure should dairy data
right

237
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:37,990
means that dash

238
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:40,180
week record and

239
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:46,070
for me we right and very simple so the
next one

240
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,210
references to certain

241
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:53,240
tech you can see it little bit more

242
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,860
here even the previous one you could see
court

243
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:01,620
the references and the references to
data it is one you can see only a

244
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:07,730
mostly called reference you can see that
from the previous command

245
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:10,830
we see regular execution and

246
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:14,020
5 jobs

247
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:22,570
it's in the exhilarating McInnis

248
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:25,650
of cross-reference

249
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:30,510
next one also have

250
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:34,300
local the ripples around

251
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,830
his streak which shows the name of a
variable

252
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,870
sorry

253
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,670
nada local variables but locally within
their streak

254
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,400
which posts this local labels names

255
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,350
this one you can't see the situation

256
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,830
we have not remain

257
00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:00,110
in a diesel local able in address 22

258
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:03,440
and 288

259
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,620
will also look at it we have looked at
how

260
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:11,510
but leaves it and what comes to

261
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,620
so what comes there's a jump here

262
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,050
and jump here so that to a different
outputs from procedure

263
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:21,370
through some conditions

264
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:27,330
practically they do the same thing

265
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:30,130
them Eve

266
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:33,610
we label these label as an exit

267
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:37,110
than this name is disappearing its
peculiarity

268
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:41,700
that disassembled already asked that but
logically named labels

269
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,400
they are global so if you're

270
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,850
remain renamed it it becomes local then
you look at

271
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,300
other options you don't see

272
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,990
there's a solution

273
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:59,490
just use another function name EX

274
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,000
hugh can't look at regular names you can
look at

275
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,210
name EX with the name TX

276
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,060
it shows a display so you have two
mechanisms available

277
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,960
you need to click global labels and
local box as well

278
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,050
segment related information

279
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:22,240
segments is a very simple

280
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,240
object which contains

281
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,340
data Colts

282
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,460
and I have noticed

283
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,920
and headset experience that

284
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:43,940
in its best case in the best case to
describe the areas of mammary

285
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:48,430
responsible for usual devices is to
create certain segments for it

286
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:53,130
example ID has created

287
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,570
automatically but generally speaking we
can also do it menu

288
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:01,050
as well you can look at descriptions of
these devices you can create

289
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:05,160
all references and they will start

290
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,180
referring to normal gary paulsen in case

291
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,500
it's very simple there's

292
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,270
get sick in touch your procedure had

293
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:18,530
I'm sitting different flags and we get
different

294
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:21,610
said properties beginning

295
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:25,620
and name Iran

296
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,670
base access rights Bates

297
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,780
flagstar types

298
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,650
next the that you have to pay attention

299
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:41,920
show is structural ish methane from each

300
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,010
this is structure

301
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:51,060
I'm not going to

302
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:56,820
discussion but in the top of this
example see you see control is achieved

303
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,130
its in order to show you that it works
for

304
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:03,480
everything and even for X 86 as well

305
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,890
so the next month's social

306
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:11,490
elements you can also

307
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,790
received a niece API's the area's edge
its

308
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:19,340
its sheet and this isn't property for it

309
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:23,970
seis lacks these

310
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:27,060
element member structure

311
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,370
equals a-minus one that address

312
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:33,530
but 80s element will refer to other
structure

313
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:37,110
Diane you will see idea of these petty
structure

314
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:41,040
and this is a really column McInnis

315
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,540
for on process its

316
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:48,030
were eight starts June loading

317
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:53,530
such copying: certain the areas of
memory and for these particular purpose

318
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:57,790
the cyst russia's therefore

319
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:01,890
from the and infrastructure you can go
to the structure itself

320
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:05,400
you can least what contains structure
its

321
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,070
arch its is dentist identify name

322
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:12,830
then also size and quantity of the
skeletons names

323
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:17,430
its in a script here

324
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:22,970
as you can see how you can discover all
this

325
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:27,230
and regular to say a few words and let's
dig

326
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:31,480
in deep it ID little

327
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:36,370
jarriel's global variables

328
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:39,390
they have common touch news

329
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:42,640
which also can be acquired by

330
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,400
the East's idea I API functions

331
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:52,570
but get let's get tag and name and of
course

332
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:59,539
we get flax its state main team here

333
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:02,590
if you look

334
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:06,779
type then it's basically a prototype

335
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:10,390
it has not been defined yet then you'll
be able to

336
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:14,210
learn some additional properties slacks

337
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:17,330
you can get it to the base elements

338
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,710
like ham many view

339
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:24,960
have worked with it already it was

340
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,700
well as separate script was the

341
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,039
describe force researching this has it
passes it

342
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:35,679
and shows all its information which is
available

343
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,000
for example appear this

344
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,970
s FTC address we have up the rubble
which is

345
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:48,390
has to bite size word and we see a
reference to it

346
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:52,809
everything's recorded in these head
element in these particular flack

347
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:59,650
in these particular bite

348
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:03,669
it is being injured so it's a

349
00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:06,740
data byte has references

350
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:10,299
it has domain name is and then by
default

351
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:14,400
them word and to

352
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,559
bites terrible says and then

353
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:20,990
in had it stores the value of the first
byte

354
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:25,299
3 so is an option

355
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:30,360
all the outboard when it

356
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:36,460
the first to the structure down here you
see a separate flood

357
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,940
showing that this is a structure here

358
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:43,940
it's a structure that we've been looking
at before

359
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,450
don't use his ani has user-defined name

360
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:50,480
so in other words we can't take all this
information

361
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,690
sub domain name

362
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:57,700
is not a result to break this
engineering and we should transfer we

363
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,230
need to take on the user-defined

364
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:03,960
next these had element also allows us to

365
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,500
for wat commands it describes them

366
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,720
action but I've noticed that some

367
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,150
in a strange way to speed up for
somewhere to command

368
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,510
which has all the one argument and

369
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:20,929
we

370
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:24,970
transfer shoo away from this command and
we see that

371
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:28,630
it rights data right so

372
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:33,820
H to out to should printed flags

373
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:38,580
and information show the information
that

374
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,750
argument refers to data

375
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:45,530
but eighty have where is it

376
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:49,760
nobody knows by let's look

377
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,830
try to check another controller since
166

378
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:57,190
same thing we

379
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:00,030
record southward to a certain number

380
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:04,160
we data right reference

381
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:11,140
cross-reference from it but we see your
information about argument let's look

382
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,370
more so already have 3

383
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:18,120
let's look at three for that we have
available

384
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,400
is one we have the similar situation but
the only difference here is that

385
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,920
we have reedy .it

386
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,740
578

387
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:35,480
artists or its region from this
particular bite and it happened

388
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,620
well it was a very interesting situation
that in had

389
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:44,270
element idea restorers other everything
that we're able to see get stores

390
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,410
information about

391
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,980
arguments is it argument type

392
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,720
for this particular like 290

393
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,920
H stored six-story

394
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,580
are three raged so its stores only for 8

395
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:04,030
64 it seeks an ARM processor for other
controllers

396
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:07,490
these information in half is not being
stored

397
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:10,780
its gonna internal bikini I T

398
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:14,240
so for the head we cannot rely

399
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,660
had for this particular situations

400
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,920
next thing

401
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:26,330
that I would like to speak about and we
have to trust me

402
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:29,850
it's a function it has a certain come
attributes

403
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:33,490
Street which shows start

404
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:36,990
and social flax type

405
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:41,530
you can get French stack for it and the

406
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:45,100
begin Casey case it doesn't exist

407
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:49,280
dan you will not see it an outboard so
in case it doesn't exist

408
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:57,260
for this particular function

409
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:57,890
let's look

410
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:02,400
variance for the are trusts sleep
function

411
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,630
with the name and it has a proud

412
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:11,420
timeout argument in it I P see here

413
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:16,640
and steak freight exists for it stick
frame

414
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:23,310
we need it for getting local variables
then we r trying

415
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:26,710
what kind of identify

416
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:30,240
a said again for a steak for 18 isn't

417
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,930
I didn't fire of structure that would be
looking at previously

418
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:37,390
what was it structure well here's a
structure

419
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:41,940
let's take this particular script you
don't say to the AM

420
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,830
and then we're trying to train

421
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:50,650
are fre-

422
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:55,990
was started

423
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:59,760
and goes to the

424
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,790
the last cycle because down here

425
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:08,090
situation to the infinite loop

426
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:11,150
well the stack is available but its 0

427
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:15,720
it's also common common situation these

428
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,150
infinite loop well West capabilities are
deteriorating

429
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:23,640
already well therefore by starting

430
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,290
leasing Dez script goals into the
infinite loop

431
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:37,070
but after correcting a little bit if
that number

432
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,980
members this patio structure will not be

433
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:44,240
equal to 0 del prete so it's a very
simple

434
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,920
cold which brings everything if you
start listing

435
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,400
a little break structure it's not so
obvious

436
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,220
box I'm frames stick frames

437
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:58,440
you can see it immediately especially
when you start listing elements

438
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,320
in addition to the fact that it boss
evident that we already have

439
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,890
notified also starts evident that is
being defined

440
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:09,670
showing us by bite by bite it's not the
best it's not the worst

441
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:13,470
auction but you have to get rid of it
issue

442
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:17,560
correct little bit and then we have
about

443
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:22,160
the following information: we can't get

444
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,010
name of the structure the name of State
frame

445
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:30,790
usually eight is similar to the initial
addresses this procedure

446
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:35,430
and then you get elements which defined

447
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:40,150
which are not quantified and here's an
example here

448
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:49,580
its very obvious one all the API's are
used

449
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:53,360
in addition to listing stake for into
the structure there's another option

450
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,330
of and a set of APIs to get

451
00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:00,590
various parameters well the suspect
frayed

452
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,740
these APIs are not connected to state
freight such

453
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:08,470
but to the function itself so this is

454
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:12,500
outboard of the area's parameters and
well it seems like a good

455
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,590
option we have local

456
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:19,750
parameters their size size

457
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:23,830
are stored registries and the size of
transfer arguments

458
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:27,809
but down here we can see that we have a
certain argument

459
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:32,510
where registries and you can also

460
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:36,360
say stored once much as an option

461
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:40,320
is just memory allocation for a local
variables

462
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,940
but most likely the source towards and
here's an argument

463
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:48,320
batteries also the Sprint this output of
discrete shows us that

464
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,600
local dairy bulls

465
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,840
24 bytes given for them and forced or

466
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,160
storage registers an argument zeros why

467
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,580
and of course

468
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:06,470
we can use to other ways to get this
size of the stake praised

469
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:13,549
through the structure though the size of
the structure into the size of the frame

470
00:31:13,549 --> 00:31:17,460
to the size of the structure we have
received 28 to the size of the frame

471
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,620
24 was a difference well with figured
out that

472
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:24,790
frame this petite Fred

473
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:29,059
in some way dependent on

474
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:33,450
process least only little bit and been
watching

475
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:39,340
the East to feels are these two API's

476
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:43,300
so framed takes into consideration only
local elements

477
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,920
in the structure we into consideration
the sick

478
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,480
so that's why

479
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,730
the differences for boys after looking

480
00:31:53,730 --> 00:32:00,900
%uh up arm well so

481
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:04,310
were interesting situation here can you
see deer can relate

482
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:07,970
letters a very small on-screen can't
really no

483
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:11,870
already header but the content is not
really

484
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:16,920
this home I for some reason I thought
that

485
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:21,960
you'll be able to see it well

486
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,960
in other ways I will tell you what
happens here in more detail

487
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,200
then we get an interesting situation

488
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:36,330
here that local variables

489
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:40,200
we have eight bytes allocated for them
the size of the frame

490
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,290
8 structural size 80 some

491
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:48,360
misalignment and then I have noticed

492
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,790
that these to ATL nice decisive stored
registries

493
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:56,940
and the size of arguments are connected
to

494
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:01,320
into a platform the

495
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:06,710
sizeof the arguments shows them number
which is returned together with red

496
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:11,240
the size of the year received byte and
registry sized

497
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,350
is something that is being used for the
work with a stack frame

498
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:19,320
to the he pp a registry so he could not
rely upon them

499
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:23,670
as well so

500
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:27,990
transferring are far this engineering
resource the main ideas

501
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:35,269
meetings for the base with two function

502
00:33:35,269 --> 00:33:38,399
and with the help

503
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:43,409
the soldier's death was realize
internally we collect Moxham

504
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:47,490
information available a bother position
on this function

505
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:51,159
compared

506
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:55,399
to mind that have while

507
00:33:55,399 --> 00:33:58,559
graph of it cellular function controls

508
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:02,019
have not been used when the dust
mechanisms that I've been showing you

509
00:34:02,019 --> 00:34:05,279
and a of course by Huseyin

510
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,520
these different information in the new
damp

511
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,609
you can search for similar functions

512
00:34:11,609 --> 00:34:14,730
functions similar to of function this
second

513
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:18,440
option its to use values a

514
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,450
variables and cross-references between

515
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:24,730
called and data to recognize variables

516
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:28,260
inside of these in New updated binary

517
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:32,550
police the area balls we can get access
to functions

518
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:35,839
and we can

519
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:40,429
have if in a basic

520
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:45,829
saddam which you have researched the
function has been returning to

521
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:51,399
three variables in has been recording
them three vehicles

522
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:54,540
were red all three of them

523
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:58,460
red but by discovering in the nude down
for trying to

524
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:02,550
find the ovals with similar names but
similar values

525
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:07,109
and by finding a function which the
refers to them for reading three times

526
00:35:07,109 --> 00:35:11,369
well with a certain level of probability
you can assume that this is the same

527
00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:12,130
function

528
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:17,079
and respectively to rate you can

529
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:20,240
do these two things you can get the
information course

530
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:26,430
which information you can get from it

531
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:31,410
this streets you cannot read trace sorry

532
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:35,490
well I'll you the presentation you will
read it later

533
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:39,120
I thought that it's going to you since
so street here

534
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,730
gives the number of commands

535
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:46,070
the same parameter was used

536
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:49,130
mind lucky so we going through

537
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:54,440
all day hats inside these functions and
we try to see the number of commands

538
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,910
them we get a strange situation

539
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:01,340
function its one command

540
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:06,340
down to go in the beginning you know it
Long Island began its

541
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:10,900
I'll but simply not dispose it well done
cause all the hats using to plus dusty

the spurted male Michael past because I
was responsible

547
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:32,920
and it's a simple way direct you plug
and billion stimulus because I look a

548
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,310
