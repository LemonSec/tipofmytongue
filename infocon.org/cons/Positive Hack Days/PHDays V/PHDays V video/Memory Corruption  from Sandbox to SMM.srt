1
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:04,730
shingle

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,980
email kinda so my name is Nick you there
I'm

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,139
sorry

4
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:14,190
if are you CIMA to

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,670
and for another presentation so

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,800
a store something happen to me because
%uh vice a president

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,490
actually something something I couldn't
come

8
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,970
I could come that make a presentation by
they were

9
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:34,739
I know I'll punish me for that so well
with I made in your presentation

10
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,300
on this presentation is a compilation of
two

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,989
from my research on the maintenance of
memory corruption

12
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:47,360
in Windows core under my colleagues
presentation from a nice

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,539
friend research team won as my help

14
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,129
abilities this just we consider

15
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:59,440
without compromising

16
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,719
so we can see each other persons droid

17
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,590
talcum to

18
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:13,600
X myself

19
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,840
rootkit so over the last 10

20
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,649
so I'll my belongings

21
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:26,409
walk nice console menu

22
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:29,490
many many researcher fun SMM

23
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,330
and access and a his such

24
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,940
first who I'll tell you house

25
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:41,440
exploit happens and the

26
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,560
or just yes compromises so as you know

27
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,410
up

28
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:55,280
fresh player browser reader well up

29
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,260
I'm so as the programs that would be
executed

30
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:03,340
showing which the

31
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,320
most of them a sandbox s I made this

32
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,929
in order to know you need to release
pushing

33
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:16,420
really and the raising privileges so
taking the poor from the sandbox s Ocean

34
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,920
is a good move for

35
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,310
am for instance

36
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,320
2013 14

37
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,810
want to own he and chrome was

38
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,190
packed through for vulnerability in the
floor but the or

39
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:39,350
is not the privileged SMS exists and
then we can go on and keep talking about

40
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,370
manageability

41
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:43,470
age in mind this they're entering and
manageability

42
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,930
a.m. engine is out of scope of our
presentation

43
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:51,840
soho don't tell you about the attacks
from this era drain plug their

44
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,049
rain 3 the ring 0 with

45
00:02:55,049 --> 00:03:00,510
I'm not sure talking about architectural
and binary vulnerabilities on Weds

46
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,890
tall grass they memory corruption three
types

47
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,470
here stack Mona based corruption

48
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,780
you but you it's rare

49
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,959
in the poor 960

50
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,629
dynamic memory I'll pool overflow

51
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:22,110
and a controlling the address

52
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,200
by the attacker sonoran steps based
buffer overflow

53
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,210
is out of range from not nothing to tell
because its tech

54
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,960
exploiters difficult permanent

55
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,110
Arbor to rear area Rep memory corruption

56
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,800
so no story i sorry because I know a
better tell you about the pool

57
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,960
overflow with different techniques

58
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,990
thats to give you arbitrary

59
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:52,490
memory corruption and transformation

60
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:56,560
overflow for controlled address

61
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,959
you and a cool

62
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:04,170
and exploit mitigation thats

63
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:10,660
now working in the core and told me
about this tech can really

64
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,730
can marry see Paul your

65
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:17,209
checks his noise them

66
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:20,850
service colonel buyer seller as Mb

67
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,340
and S&M AP

68
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,900
that works with Broadwell by then
windows it's not

69
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,230
realized and I know

70
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:35,290
I don't know how they're going till do
it because they need to redo in without

71
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:35,750
manage

72
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:42,060
output manager and remix vanilla kernel
doesn't have it

73
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,250
he get cell ago who for their

74
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,510
felker is to bypass all that. checks of
meta-data

75
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:53,000
a the bypass all those three protection
tools

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,590
yes with so

77
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:00,810
it well exploit techniques for overflow

78
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,150
I have three categories for them

79
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:09,180
first is meta-data that is

80
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,670
John can structure and

81
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:17,880
you can read about it they techniques
from

82
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,750
a researcher I didn't get the name and I
believe that one of the best articles

83
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,110
then attacks up or

84
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,960
just missing data a.m. object to leather
data

85
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,330
York I'm quality Kooh

86
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,420
am relation you up

87
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,119
and objects

88
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:42,360
type confusion mum

89
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,080
of header and they all chipped school

90
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,729
so who overflow

91
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:52,879
is such a huge topic if I

92
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:57,759
tried to describe all love them I would
take at least two hours

93
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,779
so I will not talk about the method it
cool meta-data

94
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:07,879
but the object yes

95
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:11,080
when you use

96
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,610
some API's they greater

97
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,960
timer event process print Munich's

98
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,729
Sony freedom for object in dynamic
memory I'll

99
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:24,860
I'll loose such like that

100
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,339
Chris Paul Heather John

101
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:33,190
that describes chunk up

102
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:37,400
them optional headers up

103
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,470
I'm dynamic number demagogic

104
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:48,610
Heather them the orchard will

105
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,440
Jim Hitler tell Windows

106
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,440
cell was for

107
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,730
North the idea is

108
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:02,240
their complaints very interesting field

109
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,570
for their at that is a pipe in exits

110
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:09,250
thats index email that of an element

111
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,600
that is a that's pointing

112
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,090
up object-type

113
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:21,430
that describes type its these

114
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,140
winters ask for in a special chart

115
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,710
tape people you in those

116
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:32,520
and retail Windows 8.1

117
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:38,930
doing now up this way so that element
started was the third one of the first

118
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,900
element was 0 mise sent them

119
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,509
was a constant and them yep real

120
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:49,750
pointers sup

121
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,270
the orchard type structure yep

122
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:56,719
has type in problem that keeps

123
00:07:56,719 --> 00:08:01,400
in the function pointers with like

124
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,539
something school backs them with I'd

125
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:10,599
when and partially posters so it has a
special

126
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:13,810
processing you total 8

127
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:18,180
the it's not also just that that have
some procedures

128
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,990
work clothes dump and someone is a
sister

129
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:25,370
so depending on the jamil

130
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,259
they will be either 0 or pointer to a
function

131
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:32,529
sup cell

132
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:36,079
the connection looks like that with the
time index

133
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:39,519
points and in them and object-type

134
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,310
contains list of pointers to functions

135
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:47,160
sup with the idea was

136
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,240
well it the elements start with the
third but they

137
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,100
Chris is 0 and second

138
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,260
well so we can change

139
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,960
the type index from legal so this

140
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,400
in existing like 0 or one Mitchell

141
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,930
missions for this 64-bit system

142
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:12,350
the quantum isn't

143
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,680
and with work together is sent so this

144
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,370
and and address is in the inside the
core

145
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,640
and two 22 creative Nachiketa

146
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,860
and a fake object-type you have to have
the address

147
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,070
and something that's a good thing to go
by its and not always possible

148
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,560
a 64 bit system at this address

149
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,090
is like a doctor in user mode second
easily

150
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,930
allocate the memory and create this
subject I'm

151
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:44,160
and the israeli and us so

152
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,820
SR graphical it looks like this where
change the type and extent

153
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,930
when it's all float had zero level

154
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,300
overflows an object manager thinks that

155
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,860
this object his s 01

156
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,160
rich don't exist and these addresses
soccer great faith

157
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,310
object-type before these addresses a so
with the indication

158
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:11,130
home with indications indicators are the
functions sir

159
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,730
%uh for the ownership of this called

160
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,800
Windows 8 don't want statement

161
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,140
so they changed their a they made some
changes

162
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,310
after they read my slides this address

163
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,820
it to this this array

164
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,950
his field in so than user molter

165
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,950
cannot allocated from the use a moment

166
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,260
so it's it's locked

167
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,770
and here's a simple thing so you can can
change time

168
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:45,990
time index for the non-existent I'm
index I thought

169
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,760
that it's possible to by index can from
aid to be changed from me

170
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,800
to be and update Peter time be

171
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,420
in and assault this approach with the
help of a

172
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,950
overflowed and Annika memory week will
change the type of an object

173
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,660
conductor so we'll get some results are

174
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,040
and therefore object to object manager

175
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,330
because we change the type index assay
it will see different type

176
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:18,880
objector and a file handle treated for

177
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,700
nasa before overflow your hand
assault-type

178
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,130
object type file and ass then after

179
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,480
type indexer has so it's a its class

180
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,590
he a and chain

181
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:37,660
and they've been there'll be some
changes answer some functions

182
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,320
with object that can give your permit if
so the whole flow

183
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,940
on memory at a certain address X

184
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,860
this how can we use it

185
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:52,350
after overflow don't you manager thinks
now that's a different time

186
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:56,709
reports object to a different type type
confusion

187
00:11:56,709 --> 00:12:00,790
and and and can perform certain

188
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,569
a system sir a challenge us and and
decor

189
00:12:04,569 --> 00:12:08,209
return to these objects and scenes the
objects etna

190
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:12,360
are nested into the structure so there
are pointers

191
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,709
pointers had to the structure and são
this leads to

192
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:20,749
day or flow had to hurry a the recording

193
00:12:20,749 --> 00:12:24,319
and a under the country helpful on the
concrete address

194
00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:27,799
and then I was telling you

195
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:31,629
for example playing out to be that's
what

196
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:35,449
days functions sir look like for class

197
00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:39,360
class type 3 on jur so as you see

198
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,439
on nice old and have had a damper

199
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:45,549
no functions partial closure for removal

200
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:48,660
and her so they have functions and I'll

201
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,930
bring know for example

202
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:55,660
people yes %uh typer time file

203
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,319
file types and there is a

204
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:01,930
a security parse security procedures yes

205
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:06,019
on Sun here we have an event object for

206
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:09,490
was like this to me a and then you

207
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:13,339
there systems function security
information you

208
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:17,029
again before or flow the so the core

209
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:20,709
lodging do it now there were to generate
sympathy her

210
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:23,879
default or just matter but after all
along

211
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:28,089
it will get to secure a procedure for
fun so then

212
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:32,559
another function will be called then and
that will lead to a very

213
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:37,709
interesting things word is subject hand

214
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:41,730
if you do the dumpster which is down and
%uh for many

215
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:45,249
object sir sup security your heart store

216
00:13:45,249 --> 00:13:51,170
is the whole project management if that
doesn't do any manipulations

217
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:54,860
where these with it the orgy data but

218
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:59,379
had been says security object and Diop

219
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:04,199
get set security object that the
attacking can not can actually

220
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:05,470
intercepted the

221
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,300
and implementation some I'll

222
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,749
so they are file object the object file
or injured

223
00:14:13,749 --> 00:14:15,310
is quite big

224
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:18,540
it its might quite complex and its

225
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,800
so that there is something else in
science art and device object so there's

226
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,160
there

227
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,470
and driver objective so there's and the
driver object has

228
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:30,740
another but a call back function seles
to

229
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,459
hands-on so they saw three different
things are inside

230
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:37,920
nested inside more and the you can see
that

231
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,899
object trial

232
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:47,040
and down then you can see that there is
a jumper

233
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,189
his if you re: right this object

234
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:55,860
so then you're good jumper so you
intercept

235
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,490
the implementation you

236
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:03,449
I'm service so this

237
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:08,459
that this method is is sufficient for
compromise the control the IP address

238
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:11,519
the point is that unit you

239
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,209
build this up sent you connected to the
chain

240
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:19,540
you need to do that and it's quite
challenging to do some time sir

241
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,889
Masterson structure

242
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:26,829
that yes moseley's

243
00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:30,629
so you can use a CE call functions

244
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:34,490
on nice with the help of some

245
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,540
a systems calls you can just call this

246
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:43,649
functions you can call them and a
security procedures can trigger

247
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:47,840
a so than to get security information

248
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,130
then you can get can trigger calls
launch of course close

249
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:55,190
read close handle and then

250
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:58,710
group turned around as it grows daily
procedure

251
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:02,720
a there for all object I'm sounder

252
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:09,280
my ass for some don't run so that way

253
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,660
28 classes much if 26 functions some

254
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,770
huge amount of different execution

255
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:21,030
for Sanders on overflow memory and
killed interception of persecution

256
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:25,330
other procedures molesting

257
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:29,440
then not initialized and many classes
and they are

258
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,010
no interest us work danna

259
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:37,110
you can use not only Heather

260
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:40,970
by the object rope

261
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,140
I'm because other objects have
interfaces

262
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:49,550
and there is a constructor antique re
and a great final and

263
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,470
close handle antique close

264
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:57,160
is out there that triggers something
calls

265
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,190
destructor and close procedures and

266
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:06,069
the center is and she said information
so gender-specific a

267
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:09,140
a us systems calls

268
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:13,260
four different objects like around to
and sent them

269
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:17,120
type the your

270
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,100
before

271
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,660
mine before I tested my idea for the
first time

272
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,310
I thought I could change the object time

273
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:32,520
but I feel gypped by Boog tend to treat
a test I peeled

274
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,840
about unfortunately that assumption was
wrong

275
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,000
and so when you do the calls mcentee
information

276
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,720
working factors so there's a call their
checks the mask

277
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,700
after class mcwethy and a

278
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,270
not many classes

279
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,799
this mass coincides happened and

280
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,230
mask doesn't coincide with station that

281
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:02,600
so when the station directory access
mask is different

282
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,210
that is why you cannot

283
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,789
station when the station to offer low

284
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:13,500
hand sharpshooter make it into a
directory

285
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,520
can't attribute has director can do that
you cannot do that

286
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,760
yeah does the functions Picasa taxes
mask is

287
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,880
is wrong has so the core router turned
on

288
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:29,110
writer the my professors axis mass
contract the same

289
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:33,669
mask the decor inside all

290
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:37,120
mondo was shipped your TT with

291
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,370
well so then this section

292
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,399
object Joel I can't changed

293
00:18:43,399 --> 00:18:47,460
change jobs and acted as class job
treatment

294
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,640
than them people

295
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,659
friend on the dynamic memory

296
00:18:53,659 --> 00:18:57,890
our or feel our field overflow

297
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,169
overflow to intercept executions

298
00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:04,380
you yes sir can parade

299
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,110
her second-rate memory using arbitrary
memory

300
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:11,340
a so than class symbolic link

301
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,490
object that the object looks like

302
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:18,000
her electrical string you can all flow

303
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,179
is it is cities

304
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:22,330
in

305
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:26,570
the rushes marketers and removed the
length and you can treat this subject

306
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:29,610
with the help of a symbolic link object
Ikenna

307
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:32,690
call it like that and you and you can 3

308
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:35,690
after sixty five thousand so

309
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,779
mites on any address them its

310
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:44,470
about this subject and a system of calls
is good for reading

311
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,540
awesome and out there are many
primitives

312
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:51,529
guys and their windows 8

313
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:54,460
also the army's islamic calls

314
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:58,100
202 missus the is sample this interface

315
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,190
thing mortgage sites

316
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:04,659
years the primitive that you can read
have to

317
00:20:04,659 --> 00:20:07,789
37 us the times different

318
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:11,929
different and different member

319
00:20:11,929 --> 00:20:16,600
quantum called on most who were killed

320
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,679
so working worker factor object hearsay
secondary

321
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:24,710
after eight bytes a certain dress worker
factor

322
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:28,389
object that his superiors good object
for

323
00:20:28,389 --> 00:20:31,590
duration: because there's his class this
honors

324
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:35,350
gears the premature for both operating
memory and

325
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:39,419
to and the same time it gives you a
primitive

326
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:42,960
tool to rewrite people

327
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,080
at at any interest

328
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,789
with control values who cares

329
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:58,399
them with and

330
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:02,110
we were here all committees from for
reading

331
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:05,820
over right to movies

332
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,700
I it's okay sell their bypass so the
other half

333
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,720
sorry overwrite at

334
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,279
the controlled address then

335
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:20,820
and Denman can heard

336
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,429
redirector and the execution to in other

337
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:28,380
about like and no sideshow these
primitive Sahar

338
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,870
enough to bypass any protection paying
security SEP SEP

339
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:36,240
with kind cell had a headset and I'm

340
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:49,590
course the

341
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,710
motion yeah my is to the mmm

342
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:57,220
management Paul you know a system
management

343
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,860
mode as a member you know a special his

344
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:06,130
mode of the processor with the kids now
and

345
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,679
so how it appeared as far as I remember

346
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:11,830
originally it was the churning mold but
then

347
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:16,000
later different companies like they live
damn so they learned

348
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,760
de Pinto has this mode and the requested

349
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,950
an axis through and then too small to
start it up to

350
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,760
this up to you load walks to so too

351
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,929
to switch off the to a day as the
notebook

352
00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:34,400
if it starts heating at center
commercial

353
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,740
where tutorial circular system

354
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,240
assistant manager into a interactive can
just get into it and

355
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,130
some and and protected from software and
device success

356
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:50,140
its production both so they're certainly
has certainly been about you can do it

357
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,429
a on it using software

358
00:22:53,429 --> 00:22:56,640
was born and they're so then the cold is
executed to

359
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:02,360
in a special members system management
around a special memory and it's a it's

360
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,130
location

361
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:07,360
is protected from a the core

362
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,080
and

363
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,679
Andy and the process should go back
backer

364
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:16,309
and the return return system management

365
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:19,320
does not

366
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,220
so it looks like there's MSR is search
your base

367
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:27,320
sent identifies the the physical address

368
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,999
and the Coulter with them

369
00:23:30,999 --> 00:23:35,109
in this time around so there is a I'm

370
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:38,220
officers memory to save the state

371
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,440
before s me I and the cold has Mesmer

372
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:47,950
has me I handler then

373
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:51,100
its as my handler is a

374
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,169
as a big subject matter his house

375
00:23:54,169 --> 00:23:57,169
roots marked the router chains

376
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:00,489
and all executed hustling by a link my

377
00:24:00,489 --> 00:24:04,029
along the line hand I want to go in
greater depth

378
00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:07,080
and the small is very special

379
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,669
your life and so you cannot stop it

380
00:24:10,669 --> 00:24:13,779
there's no aging mind it's being
executed to

381
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:18,559
and no member access contender some
technical specifications

382
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,330
idea sorry AP state 0

383
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:25,549
08 88 nite moves are an

384
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:28,919
and it has me I it can trigger to have a
software

385
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:32,289
with the help of the entry hall for be
to Porter

386
00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:35,659
so my wasn't done

387
00:24:35,659 --> 00:24:39,070
to some now your

388
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:43,669
worth possibilities here too developers
to make an update

389
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:47,380
to make updates so is a backdoor for
updates

390
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:51,269
for Chuck and the us

391
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:55,130
this presentation shows us

392
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:58,940
this chip-seq is good that's a good
framework come

393
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:02,870
which and so the remaining bison scripts

394
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:06,769
government history work am a developer
to write their own thing for

395
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:12,200
for you I it's an open source project to
test your system

396
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,409
whether your bias contain certain

397
00:25:15,409 --> 00:25:18,769
vulnerabilities or not and we have a lot
of tests

398
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:26,070
different s for different on their
abilities nudged

399
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:29,070
let me talk about up

400
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,680
famous attacks

401
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:34,190
as games summer so the first attack her

402
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:37,690
the simplest aka has surrounded

403
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:41,720
for a picture the region some members
programs by Sir

404
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,620
the registers and unfortunately

405
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,440
use there's a bias problems and security
problems

406
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,070
on he is that Intel block

407
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:56,560
Kalighat company so where do the viruses

408
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:00,100
and the dog technology and the company
that

409
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,350
develops their own versions of minuses

410
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:06,410
HP IBM down day

411
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:09,610
year sizzling day unfortunately

412
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:13,170
they're not using the protection
mechanism Sunday

413
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:18,070
and they make serious mistakes I don't
remember until just recently

414
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:21,100
SM a rancher was not that was not
protected

415
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,330
during a writer them

416
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:27,370
and that's what it was

417
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:30,540
and torture them radio system

418
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:34,160
his open and this summer /em you can
check it terms

419
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,080
with the help of a certain a script from
chip-seq and

420
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,190
to make sure it works then than motion

421
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:44,600
this research is very interesting and
goes back to

422
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,240
nursery and pass a diff lock

423
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,830
researcher here found out

424
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:56,940
he found death this SM for some RAM can
be cashed

425
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:01,220
using cell a methods sure and cash is
not protected

426
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,900
and vests you can re-write as some RAM

427
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:08,720
have the coldness some RAM hammer and
trigger a semi

428
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,130
and execute thickness mm motor the
called

429
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:16,860
and miss a memo with I'm sure been based
on their ability was

430
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:21,500
fountain invisible things slap and this
is a shame core Intel

431
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:26,770
it worse share for Intel too because the
US just call

432
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:32,080
on the year not a process some RAM
memory updating just call

433
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,080
function call that is said in the

434
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:40,050
the space of for so then the attacker
can change the cold

435
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:43,690
at this address in the secure his call
to with their rights home runs

436
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:46,930
in the SMM Hamilton

437
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:49,620
sometimes even had one asap SMI

438
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:53,250
sign up to 14 vulnerabilities they found

439
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:56,340
so everything's so

440
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,660
not not good us and it's not safe

441
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:07,309
systems are secure founder and the
stakes

442
00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:11,670
find a call quotes from a legacy

443
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:14,670
a memory services physical memory

444
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:18,660
and Anya see

445
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:22,580
not have everything else was not doing
it so this is the cold

446
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:25,900
sensor thing slap

447
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,640
so they just called the FBI indicator
from PI

448
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:34,460
memory and from the court not to stem

449
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:40,429
protector by the way

450
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:44,760
against them search on their abilities
when you just call

451
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,570
outcall Hong Kong China wanting another

452
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:51,740
calls call not from SMM

453
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:56,919
Eagles Intel on you introduced in your
new technology

454
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:00,440
which is an analog on my sympathy for
some

455
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,240
social causes execute it was a cement
and then there's

456
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,210
jump into the members assess an hour so
there is a fault

457
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:11,710
losses his about to a fam trips

458
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:14,799
I can checkered wood chips etc and

459
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,269
so they just don't include the SOP

460
00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:24,820
us

461
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,960
just the graphical representation

462
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,080
gypsum check exception

463
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,600
is this picture whose

464
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,420
me

465
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:43,290
we Michael before my knowledge did his
research

466
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:47,000
million been any operation home

467
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,710
on memory damage yes be worse
manipulations

468
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:56,100
conservative members greatness around
him it was a repeat his

469
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,820
germs on protecting into unprotected
member

470
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:03,370
yes is ship

471
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:08,630
calling calling conventions who worked
at the register should contain it looks

472
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:09,430
like this

473
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:14,240
with on here see Eqs

474
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,860
it's a function that's an idea had to be
axis

475
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:22,570
pointer and did you use that term

476
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:26,260
just that in certain register

477
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:29,540
they show the and the cold over there
there

478
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:33,000
her called exist and

479
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,540
many biases the the culture

480
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:40,650
there whether it's them this

481
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:44,980
house and is this this is in the same
RAM this memory and we're not

482
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:49,790
and then if you put the pointer that
points there some ramps are you Canada

483
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:50,270
right

484
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:53,620
with a certain value this member in this
summer /em

485
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:57,220
nor shit about it but the

486
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:02,050
privately held to the same RAM is not
known and %uh vendors

487
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:05,050
different vendors have very specific

488
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:10,700
you cannot re-write care some certain
certain indicator because we don't know

489
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:14,080
has some so where this use

490
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,140
located that but there's another

491
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:21,910
also very good methods some

492
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:25,720
Nissin ramen I'm sorry I'm contains
information

493
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,770
I concerning the founders service

494
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,780
a range

495
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:34,460
hand Jennifer pledging

496
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:38,200
and if the value that is overwritten
written

497
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,920
Hill into memory if it's good up for it.

498
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,930
on the arrange done next work is already

499
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:49,460
on because we can easily

500
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:52,860
rewrite over actor zubak range

501
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:56,040
and duce the as a member

502
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,740
think that this summer /em he isn't in
another adventure

503
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,400
so we do they relate cation into the
unprotected

504
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,970
member more and the smoke and

505
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:11,500
her work and right according to some RAM
get

506
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,810
which will be in court remembering and
execute

507
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:18,600
we in to execute your call

508
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,820
yes

509
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:24,590
up so there are some subtleties

510
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:27,760
but did here

511
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:33,670
is is is what I've told machine

512
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:41,340
so then there's a shift me up

513
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:45,450
I have I have a demo it's not America

514
00:32:45,450 --> 00:33:56,409
my track to play

515
00:33:56,409 --> 00:34:06,919
that

516
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:10,520
substances both console Picasa here's
console

517
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,710
short when you launch sex

518
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:17,109
checks tunings she settings

519
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:20,280
for us around for sure and logics

520
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,120
word Lee and he said

521
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:28,190
printer difficult them sexy buttons

522
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:31,580
anything with us 26 their

523
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:35,010
think table things there yes

524
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:52,000
public pride mixed up

525
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,270
what

526
00:34:52,270 --> 00:35:07,420
what sex

527
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,010
surprise himself goals

528
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:14,660
so this early cation of some revelers so
windfall

529
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:24,520
the process so such techniques like in
the corner

530
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:28,079
head point indicator this

531
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,730
some them attacks its can't

532
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:36,280
have to change your

533
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,619
but on the other hand if you target

534
00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:43,109
Europe against the bias certain

535
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:46,150
vendor with and against certainly can

536
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:53,119
make a more intricate exploit some other
thank you

537
00:35:53,119 --> 00:36:03,760
both

538
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:12,810
yep

539
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:17,100
using I think it's

540
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:22,040
a few when i say bout be feel sad I i
think it's a shame

541
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,250
pasa I held be awesome understood which

542
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:30,860
to correct a on their villages because
the bias structures quite complicated

543
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:35,600
and that too remover well they're built
this takes a lot of time just a lot of

544
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,009
time

545
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:39,940
so years years sometimes I

546
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,970
you here at we these 3

547
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:47,200
vulnerability her you must who have
heard about it someone

548
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,090
said it made a presentation to the
December at sissy

549
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:56,560
presentation Intel to launch the patch
but it didn't work and then all vendors

550
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,510
for honorable

551
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:00,590
them all war and here in

552
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:03,950
here and now dispatchers and it will be
released

553
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:07,310
by have it will be released by

554
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:10,970
by Intel 10 well all the vendors who
have with her

555
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:14,150
rap two years your scratchers but even
after

556
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:17,250
a bad a patch has been released

557
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:21,750
I don't know the people who can her
installed by Sunday

558
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:25,370
so that I mean is systems are not
patched

559
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,690
and and vulnerable

560
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:33,580
and get this mm they are pretty well
protected through

561
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:37,440
from New York went over my abilities so
they're much better than done core

562
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:45,190
systems

563
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:54,579
any more questions

564
00:37:54,579 --> 00:37:57,369
good whatever every ever

565
00:37:57,369 --> 00:38:00,969
come across iraq

566
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:04,719
around using least X rockets

567
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:08,299
or source consort

568
00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:11,549
Missy I i do not work for in this area
is it now

569
00:38:11,549 --> 00:38:14,650
in the wild haven't seen

570
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:18,880
thing in the world muzzle

571
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,699
while in the world

572
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:28,179
to meet in five years time learn that
they exist now so there's a five-year

573
00:38:28,179 --> 00:38:28,640
delay

574
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:35,249
bridge learned exist missile

575
00:38:35,249 --> 00:38:38,589
so ability yes that it's more difficult
to

576
00:38:38,589 --> 00:38:42,529
couldn't to identify them okay my dual

577
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:45,710
yep

578
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:48,769
them would

579
00:38:48,769 --> 00:38:51,930
so we show says the reigning champ
probably increase

580
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:56,319
for covering must some kernel memory

581
00:38:56,319 --> 00:39:01,230
rear we head out there pre go with them

582
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:04,420
we've passed their control usual

583
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:08,099
through some previous generation yeah

584
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:11,030
as up

585
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:14,280
this handlers are least so you can

586
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,760
have your call executed

587
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:49,410
that yes yes that that yes

588
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:49,700
thank you
