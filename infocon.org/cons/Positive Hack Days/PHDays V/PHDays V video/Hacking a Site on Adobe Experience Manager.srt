because we worked on deep

74
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:03,880
load up

75
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,230
100 megabytes that's what it showed me

76
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:13,250
try to analyze that when I'm interested
in

77
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,980
named users from gym site with the
Python

83
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:26,439
on regular expression on that

84
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:30,759
on Pinterest and undercuts truck modem

85
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:56,940

86
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,770
so is on filtered up users now

87
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:10,260
attracted print map

88
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,370

normally

92
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:33,520
any contest starts from collecting
information that's

93
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,159
very important stage vanity contest

94
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:41,260
just understand what's on their
abilities

95
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,730
%uh those are target are coming weeks
point on

96
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:51,029
what do you want as attackers for our

97
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:54,050
target is at a extra-special first thing
is to

98
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,589
get an important information under
content

99
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:02,130
repository than us and what Joe bundles

100
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,440
our center see

101
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,470
what customs JSP scripts other

102
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,550
extracted names

103
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:15,510
password hashes and find those elements

104
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:21,180
and content repository we should give us
for anonymous would have occasion

105
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:26,190
posts

106
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:31,890
some interesting information from
repository content nobody is measured as

107
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:36,470
a bundle which is called

108
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,630
Jason renderer so let thats

109
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:44,150
so let them this bundle riche we have
seen

110
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,410
demo

111
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:50,670
it allows us to get properties OT

112
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,399
element from the content repository
content

113
00:09:54,399 --> 00:10:02,079
repository isn't 3 with each element to
the street has its own

114
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,649
pictures so this servlet class to get
elements

115
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:09,959
0 elementary right dog Jason

116
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:15,770
will get properties the root element

117
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:18,780
ed 6 will get properties

118
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,890
its subsidiary elements up to the 6th

119
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:28,250
player at suffix tidy the LIBOR readable

120
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,650
Jason you should take

121
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:36,260
put into it instead of six good
properties

122
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,860
uphold the sub-cellular subsea jury

123
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,860
elements so the lil dump hope

124
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:49,830
proposed to read content how to get
listed

125
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,980
all the little bumps planters

126
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,000
special element just called been dump
its content

127
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,850
can use for that

128
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:07,740
another bundle school or builder

129
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,330
I haven't linked to that

130
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:14,450
it allows make requests to the

131
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:17,630
content repository language similar to

132
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:22,900
express language

133
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,090

135
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:33,260
just called ops dump it

136
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,680
I mean its content how to get

137
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:42,230
was to custom scripts up

138
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,800
as usual accessed this element stilted
by the settings

139
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:51,220
so so

140
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,460
it's not locked anonymous user we can
try to get

141

00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,310
are share they have comply

143
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:07,110

151
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:48,580
in the demo you have seen that to help
corrugation builder we can do that so is

152
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,110
my

153
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:54,340

226 whatsapp is nothing works

170
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:09,120
we can try alone attack

171
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,600
example how can do that with the fries
or potato

172
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:18,700
which is code Linux so have user names

173
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:23,700
and we pick a password so we have some
dictionary

174
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,029
up

175
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:30,360
after we have excess

176
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,600
all what else we can do depending on
what kind of success with you

177
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,480
obtain so it can make excess

178
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,500
attacks CSRF attacks 2s attacks

179
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:48,450
RC local files unfortunately don't have
time

180
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:52,480
toe but TX X assess says have

181
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,860
do sl2 about RC

182
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,279
a farce or a little it is and that
overexpress bennett-jones 10

183
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:06,250
these little bit is gonna die zur for
that already

184
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:11,890
markets related that

185
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:15,190
those who is manager has web dev plugin

186
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:20,209
we can Manish for the content through
the third of political

187
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:24,920
as you may know it uses

188
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:30,580
XML and just happened particular

189
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:34,490
plugin well los tres Persia

190
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,000
its partial smiles are safe so this

191
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,170
parcel was initialized are safe that's
why

192
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:46,810
bustle have ecstasy attacks have also
wrote exploit

193
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:50,360
for the civil liability and put it on
exploit to be

194
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,720
comp that

195
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,840
sign well discs ploy

196
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,620
is two methods first

197
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,780
are of mount technique

198
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:11,270
which as well this krypton and second
block

199
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,670
and normal in about exploitation

200
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:20,350
why two techniques goes

201
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:24,140
forum on exploitation we don't need to
have any credentials

202
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:30,030
as just got an anonymous simply

203
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,730
send request to have dove prop fine with
proper

204
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:40,550
XML and we get local files but again
there are some disadvantages that today

205
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,590
the server

206
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:45,740
Andy's

207
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,460
to click is not to stable as regular

208
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:56,870
to pick up exploitation xx kid

209
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,980
now let's take a look at BDO how this
vulnerability

210
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,120
to be paraded

211
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,620
exploit to recreate

212
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,080
elements of xxc any content repository

213
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,850
up

214
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:18,970
tried to get connected to the repose
through

215
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:30,480
with to vote tough client which is
called head over

216
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:41,030
so we and to non a mus credentials

217
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:45,840
and I'll band less and see listing

218
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,780
what parts

219
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:53,770
are Indian content repository did

220
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,690
to quest for a pint which brings us back
to listing

221
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:01,270
was last modified

222
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:09,170
to trigger up

223
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:12,520
X succeed we at external entity

224
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,900
launch netcat under

225
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:26,450
port 4444

226
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:29,010
and we see that the application server

227
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:33,010
as connect attack

228
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:37,260
works but thats outward bound

229
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:48,309
to pick government

230
00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:50,090
are showed credentials

231
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:53,740
are nanos nanos now will try to have in
bout

232
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:59,940
not up

233
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,679
so need to have potentials with higher
authorities in

234
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:11,800
with the help of

235
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,000
command min request prop page

236
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,940
be read in this case needed

237
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,050
listing of current directory and

238
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:25,330
proper to elements axe X the and you see
that

239
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:35,720
listing on the current directory

240
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,240
some traditional for to read the file
you see in this really

241
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,440
same

242
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,010
send request acquire proper church

243
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:51,730
with X Mountain

244
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,940
send request proprietor see the content
of the i2c

245
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:05,010
file on a sweetie so now

246
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:09,909
the most interesting thing is RC if we
are not in

247
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:15,090
admin you Oct

248
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:18,280
the admin credentials we can do that at
admin on

249
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,419
and over to disparage in in the
beginning

250
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:26,909
how the scripts work with a double
tourism initiatives separation between

251
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:30,100
content and

252
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,330
process service content so we have

253
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:37,830
nan a mentor which is called RC and

254
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:40,840
we assigned to bed

255
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,039
properties mixers types

256
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:47,270
equals RC type

257
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:51,679
and we have an element its

258
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,530
daughter element collapse with the

259
00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:00,470
a scripts don't SB

260
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:03,610
exact gotti just be and then we

261
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,809
news exec just peace group

262
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:10,309
thats basically and then

263
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:14,770
gonna be five steps hard to get are
seeing if we have

264
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:18,659
admin credential nursing recreate

265
00:21:18,659 --> 00:21:22,950
element too tight and

266
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:29,380
folder will callers RC e-type

267
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,510
and lonely a blow to the settlement

268
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:39,310
so far just be script exact juice P them

269
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:43,700
we would help pull no

270
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,150
doesn't matter prisoners as a panel

271
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:50,960
called posts or let allows

272
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,460
to have some manipulations with content
we use oppression

273
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:01,860
copy so we copy element

274
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:05,920
RC type

275
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,250
into element haps up

276
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:14,800
will create element RC

277
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:21,320
and me assigned proper to source I percy
type none we

278
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,380
send GetRequest this

279
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:28,290
our C dot exacted our script exact just
being

280
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:34,260
is performed

281
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:49,340
its demo copy works

282
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,420
first launch Nazca to

283
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,470
import World War

284
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:58,140
more where you need to get

285
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:04,960
reverse shell to that so

286
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:13,680
scripts exact just being we should all
get this error so

287
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:18,650
reverse shell all insist on it first we
will

288
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:21,680
apologize to create element

289
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:51,240

298
00:24:55,110 --> 00:25:17,249

299
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:20,889
up to a disco it by I'm going to create
an

300
00:25:20,889 --> 00:25:24,080

303
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:10,239
prime credit that Nana concerned

304
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:14,099
acquiring request to the

305
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:17,919
exact element and put Suffolk

306
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,349
suffix exact to the RC min

alone my name is a charm from

314
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:27,879
this particular beginning shown will
herbal deserve the oldie

315
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:31,309
tours de wrong config rated

316
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:36,029
a serial which allowed is anonymous user
to

317
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:39,899
read that if few take experience manager

318
00:27:39,899 --> 00:27:43,499
out of the box by default and creative
side which by default

319
00:27:43,499 --> 00:27:47,169
a seal for anonymous user are set the
read

320
00:27:47,169 --> 00:27:50,829
is going to be allowed to or depends on
the

321
00:27:50,829 --> 00:27:54,519
site admin configuration its

322
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:57,959
quite difficult system for doctors
pressure

323
00:27:57,959 --> 00:28:01,559
I asked the Wed to give it to me

324
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:06,149
to study they didn't respond

325
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:09,539
indeed there's a project called
apologists link

326
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:12,799
it's an open source project

327
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,859
and with that maybe seventy percent is

328
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:20,749
based on experience manager so

329
00:28:20,749 --> 00:28:24,859
although features a founder

330
00:28:24,859 --> 00:28:29,320
phone by just linger real site

331
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,729
his pension to

332
00:28:32,729 --> 00:28:36,490
are subject to this movies 2 East

333
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:40,309
watch we have cement there's no GM

334
00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:44,450
we confirmed for grid access list of
course you can do that there are

335
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:48,669
components and urban transportation just
call dispatcher

336
00:28:48,669 --> 00:28:52,059

337
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:55,480
to these I'll Mintzer preposterous

338
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,700
probably it was misconfigured are

339
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,730
so which led to this problem clear

340
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:16,799
thank you colleagues and other questions

341
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:21,789

any reading scripts

342
00:29:21,789 --> 00:29:27,250
to extract all the information from
decided dog's owners permission

343
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:31,610
the beginning and I show three links

346
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,830
and title the experienced managers
should

347
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:48,909
curity part 1 second Park told the
article was not ever published

348
00:29:48,909 --> 00:29:52,210

00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:58,690
link was actually

351
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:03,380
condition with the box was Persia and
there was no other social outlet

352
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:09,750

question and redressed chase on

354
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:16,620
were get data from a coming from
database

355
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:20,309
or chrome into storage yeah well

356
00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:23,960
mizanam databases

357
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:29,610
way inclusion away the user account on
people's

358

359
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:37,820
so physically wilkens

360
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:41,290
torn and enemies and filesystems

361
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:46,840
wants and tutoring most incredible that
willingness interface room can

362
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,360
obtain sensed all database or the whole
repository

363

364
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:58,760
is misconfigured theoretically yes we

attacking why

374
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:33,590
I decided to go about it I don't see big
security problem

375
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:37,570
