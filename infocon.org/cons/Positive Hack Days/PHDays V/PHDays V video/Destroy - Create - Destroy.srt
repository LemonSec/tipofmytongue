1
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:04,629
group for

2
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:09,310
or tea door with whom she shared her

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:13,390
I near book was all in all so it was
good each

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,429
enabled it possible to go easy online

5
00:00:16,429 --> 00:00:20,999
she did she is a small just the two name
the

6
00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:24,390
ship her on speaker

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:35,449
will shop

8
00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:40,760
good camp

9
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,640
ascent like to talk about terror

10
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,160
a certain thinks and identify some
thoughts and

11
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,960
to our asset let's start with a riddle

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,809
it's a magic number one of four

13
00:00:55,809 --> 00:00:59,059
work what do you think what do you think
it means

14
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,100
what does it mean 401

15
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,600
yes issue sweep it over okay its get and
this is the number of days

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,020
that Google will allow to remove

17
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,930
vulnerabilities from from this

18
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,960
software identification over

19
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,000
their villages and this is the time line

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,070
and and the developer has a

21
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,810
timer to you or to do a patch to update

22
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:34,679
and search and the user can use it and
%uh so this number actually a

23
00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:38,159
a speeds up to other concomitant

24
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,130
processes makers for example a couple
years ago we had to so than a

25
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:47,720
number of days that you are to removal
of the problems

26
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,670
some and no one is happy with this
number

27
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,700
so the users said

28
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,710
don't like it day

29
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:01,899
developers don't like it and because
it's so fast and there's not enough time

30
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:03,200
or something

31
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,780
the researchers don't like it the
developers don't like it

32
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,680
Sunday and Minnesota being am being a
researcher

33
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,680
also understand it or not for 104 days
is nothing

34
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,000
said very little time now so compared to
you

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,750
the time it takes to develop in you
software and the

36
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,400
to regulate doesn't like so then the
regulator

37
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,360
is and say that absolute security is
replaced by

38
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,200
risk security compare comparative
security

39
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,569
certain level of security so they day
day in order to secure will be hacked

40
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:41,019
but

41
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:45,510
when she just a matter of time and
they're so then the regulator

42
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,709
SOES is resigning to on to

43
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:53,360
to that instead the system will
eventually be

44
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,430
pack so down dear as I was saying so
dandy

45
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,620
developers I had acted the regulators

46
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,870
bite the bullet to the researchers are
unhappy

47
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,130
well about the timelines and ask him and

48
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:11,900
so then the situation is slowly changing
and

49
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,740
so even those who for up

50
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,970
so want who asked for services

51
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,300
so don't happy with the results because
a

52
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,980
usually so there is a around two pillar

53
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,250
so this number on their villages goes
down a

54
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,430
number to but if you study her

55
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,750
the software and an eventual the
situation is

56
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,340
levels of and then you get the
impression

57
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:44,350
that the number is no changing so what
what they're doing so you invest a lot

58
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,240
of money

59
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,360
it's very time consuming labor-intensive

60
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,990
the disfigure is not improving and this
is kind of this

61
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:56,460
rule that of hatred to so when the each

62
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:01,020
hates everyone else which one and
they're so they hate each other

63
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:06,770
so both the the regulator the user the
researcher the developer and

64
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,620
so then this hatred and hatred their own

65
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,720
turns around and this is what

66
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,580
and so then the new in the last five
years group trying to

67
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:23,900
figure it out and so than that working
from the company

68
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,110
as a that shit certifies

69
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,490
for its products on the basis of paper
requirements

70
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,900
and there we realize that we need to do
research

71
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,950
practical security and even just a

72
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:40,400
Assoc talk about the importance of
regulators

73
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,960
because there's paper a regulations that
are important to learn this

74
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,040
and and it and that's related to the
pressure for security

75
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,190
some say summer approach her

76
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,250
dry summer approaches going around so
that people in

77
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,470
wearing their caught some Thai

78
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,290
and so there are people wearing T-shirts
and

79
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:06,350
submit so wanna talk about on their
ability so why

80
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:11,100
way the algorithm so because there's the
idea that has been formalized towards

81
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,229
the mission systems

82
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:15,389
and then eventually and campaigns

83
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:18,510
a certain thing said that were part are

84
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,520
or something written on paper was in the
head to the person who developed

85
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,699
and I think that's so this could this
this components should not

86
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:30,760
that BP that against each other so the
need to complement each other

87
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:36,410
to pieces synergetic a for the sake and
for the sake of the developers and all

88
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,130
stakeholders and the regulators and the
user's

89
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,139
to and so that would comply

90
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:47,639
with the requirements home the regulator
show that mean

91
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,320
say a few words about myself and

92
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,770
what loved it was studying how it's been
going on

93
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,870
and what mistakes we have made and

94
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,680
some I go back her

95
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,909
long way concerning IT security

96
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:07,620
and so we hear are parked over in for
tax

97
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,740
group of companies and so we've been

98
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,909
that way over the last five years so we

99
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:19,210
we work long syringe attacks so this is

100
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:24,150
over complicate cryptosystems his other
components is so we

101
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,439
for example so we will protect so the

102
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:31,139
and the Russian Railways her her tickets

103
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:34,940
so than other things we write to the
Colts

104
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,900
with developing the software Anderson
works pretty well

105
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,990
and actually we performed pretty well

106
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:47,430
so about five years ago and we've got
the impression that their sizes

107
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,800
functional requirements

108
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,750
that would should be complying to the
crime so the regulator we should have

109
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,909
concerned also

110
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:58,300
Paso the functional characteristics of
the products or start it

111
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:03,259
with efficiency so then we're trying to
get to the Gigabyte

112
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:07,400
to speed and we're catching up for some
together because they were

113
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,219
market went far ahead at that time so we
have got caught up with them in to

114
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:13,740
develop new approaches

115
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,270
out to complement testing Mathis
functional tests

116
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,759
out like this

117
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:23,090
different tests user experience this is
and

118
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:26,530
car and %uh so we're we just increased

119
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:32,610
our efficiency now so then we calculated
the area since entering the next test

120
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:33,180
for

121
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:39,259
logical step so would be to concern
ourselves with security or solutions

122
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:42,370
it was very important and that was
elated

123
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,460
just and to the factor that to this

124
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:51,470
the publication about vulnerabilities
started to

125
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,729
seep into the pages the mass media and

126
00:07:55,729 --> 00:08:00,530
Sun people were confused so what to do
with that nickel slots on their

127
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,349
abilities

128
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:05,880
securities none dares than and people
were confused

129
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,889
missus its certified but at the same
time is

130
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:12,419
it's around around the world or so under
abacha's

131
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:15,430
something to be used protection efforts
need to be

132
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,090
implement and a service Howard to mold

133
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,360
and %uh so the key points

134
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,219
that we and 2012 fun

135
00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:30,030
sup 2012 so now just we had

136
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:33,440
in so where concerning ourselves with
the issue or

137
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,700
secure development so that took him bad
security

138
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:42,729
hinder development group so then the
Monitoring Centre so this what we are

139
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:46,399
will launch in 2014 monitoring centers
alarms

140
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,459
him on his door so when when it or the

141
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:53,160
development effort to are developers
software

142
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,270
to make it to congenitally secure

143
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:03,900
from Linda so what are we talking about
them

144
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,569
ham first so the first idea

145
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:10,910
I don't want to talk about how we war

146
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,010
packing sir SNR

147
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:17,220
two factions so some of them no matter

148
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,780
how to attack broader than me and some
others are not interested

149
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:26,210
how to hack broke so cuz have their own
people who know how to hack

150
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:30,310
so but we with the help of different
methods

151
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:33,820
famous means so we organized

152
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,850
sir efforts how to increase the security
of the products

153
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:42,180
this massive so I think it was found
very important point

154
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,620
which allows to give more value from
research

155
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,890
and justified for business purposes

156
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,930
for the developers and

157
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:56,550
in Prosser someplace got good results
sometimes negative positive experience

158
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,510
an experience

159
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:02,790
was welcome and her and then

160
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:08,180
so we're just or followed sustainable
fashion so that contribute to the cycle

161
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:08,910
of

162
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:14,650
security enhancement as and when it
understand where

163
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,660
so that the developers a big systems

164
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,640
within bad security so companies

165
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,650
Saunders IT systems business pros

166
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:29,690
lacking at the company's so than 90

167
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,950
security issues hard

168
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:36,830
very pertinent so the IT security

169
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:40,570
use 100 call product sample and

170
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:44,070
people's for are excited

171
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:48,870
and company has been participants of
different

172
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:52,330
important so how Asian friends

173
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:56,270
invited us and was the best Russian
conferences

174
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:00,580
written in the russian with lots of
criminalistics

175
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,210
Sanders they tried to to distribute

176
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:07,310
viruses to

177
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:11,260
get so to answer does my wrists and to
alright

178
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,550
system so this is the something

179
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,630
is high indigent him

180
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,960
so we have a lot of information %um

181
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,230
and the product that will develop hits

182
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,270
it's up and running yes it can get the
remote access to our programs

183
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:32,360
and that's all great interest because
it's a

184
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,960
knowledge the people a SOHO

185
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,010
attack two sisters now so that's

186
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:42,930
complex broad so with the life cycle

187
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:46,610
which consists of number components

188
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:49,760
so the product

189
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,540
needs to be certified came to the
conclusion was

190
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,680
the product acquires a

191
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,940
so certain the low-interest IT security
starting from

192
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,450
development requirements certification

193
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:07,610
design development testing the way so
when you

194
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:10,830
stop to reading this system when you
remove it

195
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,280
discontinued and

196
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,790
so all the way

197
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:21,850
to the and life cycle so when you

198
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,910
so when you destroy the system

199
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,990
should and there we decided to for

200
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,560
to learn to see what can experience
exists in the market

201
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,760
so what is the secure development or
product

202
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,700
stance to apply

203
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,350
what's written here to the extent
Wonderstone

204
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,400
so that they will look at different
domains so there's a

205
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,930
stages secure the room when it ordered

206
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:52,650
and responding responding I'm

207
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:56,210
the longer religious and life cycle

208
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:00,290
dan's then

209
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:04,120
everything that has has to do people
technology

210
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,750
business pros all this come for mister

211
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,170
put it together and make it go oldest

212
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:14,490
back so we realized that we need to do
it

213
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:18,340
im and to follow police points I

214
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,460
so it was thought with them

215
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,240
so we started with man you might call it
started with the following

216
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,520
as my colleagues were saying does
developing organizations developers

217
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:35,340
researchers India security issues so we
started with ourselves

218
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,840
so with the hearted security

219
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:43,980
Security Auditor all their systems
because we are all around our country

220
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,380
russia's rock what information are
stored

221
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:51,200
within our systems and if you streamline
did

222
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,270
then service to ridiculous so you can

223
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:58,040
can think past for a number of attacks

224
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,950
so that that could be launched against
us

225
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,930
against decline

226
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,560
viewers sewer system against us

227
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,209
shop via us Center used

228
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:16,089
and so we look at everything we're here
so this is quite interesting and juicy

229
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:20,110
or guys for the best guys and so this is
a

230
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,899
technological companies so developing
centers distributed

231
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:27,569
dick that's what we're here so many
things

232
00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:31,000
and angolan change shuffled all the time

233
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,779
so all the resources are administered by
developers

234
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:38,430
up programming years

235
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:41,810
virtual machine settings he's the
ultimate authority

236
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,990
and the same gesture of

237
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:49,329
India as a supporter Department

238
00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:54,160
so they can outsource thinks become more
vulnerable

239
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,420
but when we talk about this security
it's

240
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:03,790
protections it means that you have to
work with Health Sciences

241
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:07,550
software not in the house software

242
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,939
compatibility test so there's and

243
00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:14,290
so then this product is so great
interest

244
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:17,180
and it now it can be

245
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,240
we have headed summer college

246
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,590
have been instances when when they tried
to attack him to hack

247
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,880
am Santos to still do materials to
develop materials

248
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,990
quite quite interesting so answered

249
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:37,680
means that the developer is an
interesting target averaged

250
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,890
issues what if you hear what the
regulator

251
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:44,010
says it's a good solution for

252
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:47,370
for hacking in a sauna attacker so very
much changed

253
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:50,380
specialized tarde attacks target

254
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,250
her attempts to hack to the information
systems that bespeaks

255
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,840
bespeaks the importance our system and
its

256
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,780
and its its wealth

257
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:05,080
and absolute example away

258
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,580
can get together with net and and
distributed so there was a similar story

259
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:13,040
character her risen there was a
publication

260
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,810
some companies Richard pastor Troy on

261
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,970
her viruses for three years to

262
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:24,030
was okay so they were so successful
although they were distributing

263
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,949
so story on him bandaged

264
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:31,560
software and so than results have been
monitoring and

265
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:37,519
the audit so we can so we decided to
pull the logical to set out for

266
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,800
our own monitoring center so

267
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,620
40 partners for I'll companies

268
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,420
report River companies and we do not
claim

269
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,980
that way courageous and you see him no
what you need when it

270
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,850
answer within our own functionality and
reliability said

271
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,959
sold in a pack as we go so we need to
develop more

272
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:05,209
more stuff by ourselves and and

273
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:10,299
and it's not only the analysis
collection and data collection

274
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:14,480
so we can work and get this more
information from the problems

275
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,770
sources but what's important is to

276
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:22,020
joint effort ticketing and
synchronization

277
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,299
with client client base as

278
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:29,360
in-house is would outside companies

279
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,630
following asks identification we've

280
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,720
services public a public software

281
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,340
is year to here's judy

282
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:44,960
incidents and a life-cycle incidence
node

283
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,270
Sona hai K I'm

284
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:51,809
finished with general statements

285
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:55,169
from now so what is this

286
00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:59,250
monitoring center doing size the
standard procedures

287
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:03,980
analysis night systems monitoring the
orders

288
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,919
else

289
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:08,990
so than devote their abilities
identification so

290
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:13,039
we saw that there were a lot of
challenges

291
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,690
public price Crouch challenges at a very
important time

292
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:22,269
power for way and reliable development

293
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:26,009
so awesome in this would be the final
store success

294
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:29,070
to present very popular like

295
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:33,389
so so control control on the
publication's

296
00:18:33,389 --> 00:18:36,570
homeowner religious in the third party
components

297
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:39,570
a certain very interesting thing Hazare
hundreds

298
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:43,230
outside components and OS

299
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:47,900
analysts and the song glamorous for
Association some third-party comparte

300
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:52,440
if you don't try two minutes or does
have on their futures which are inherent

301
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,620
after those things again all this
compromise the fraud

302
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,010
final product your product negotiated
and defied

303
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:05,490
on after the event after the
certification has taken place in there

304
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,480
is difficult to change anything so

305
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:14,070
and a vulnerability I'm explodes ernest
was too late to taking steps under

306
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,850
too expensive and then the so than
mentioning sir

307
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:21,510
a half day on the front exit

308
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:26,179
on the Internet what's good and what's
bad and someone with a mandatory

309
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:29,890
her notations a mention Inkster

310
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:34,309
so for example beep net coordinator sold

311
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:37,840
so what's was deposed most 2.0 selling
the

312
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,130
net a router through

313
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:44,150
Beatles so unless me know what that is

314
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,809
why should anyone want too much and this
isn't

315
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:52,900
some work to do so this time so you do
become very popular

316
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,900
people on beginning to buy although the
wounded

317
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,980
and then moving or chew the technology

318
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:07,630
that technological stack him nothing
just released on the instruments and

319
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,490
methodologies

320
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:12,429
procedures love you good cast said
because

321
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:16,040
is there's a long list yep

322
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,559
my mail

323
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:22,190
Pandora technicals I don't want to go
into it that we can just say that so

324
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,390
there are some static

325
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,910
static announces Monica now since the
phasing

326
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:30,020
with the old we do want to get

327
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,530
the final stage and for this will
develop

328
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:37,539
instruments and so what I on it too tell
specifically

329
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:42,230
his that was the final outcome most
outcome experience

330
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:45,720
goes to prove that had the best
Department works

331
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,980
and although it has not competence

332
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,650
testing for security

333
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:54,280
but they do it anyway he adapted the

334
00:20:54,280 --> 00:21:00,030
outlook tests can do the reverse this
some mixer on its on you

335
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:03,230
versions Holt old mistakes

336
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:06,660
to to do about them and

337
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,770
so this is what we with take to take it
to the test

338
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:15,660
Department and then

339
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:19,980
has we progress so identified

340
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,809
very interesting points is a how what
what not to do

341
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:28,200
I'm not to research in should what needs
not to be done

342
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,809
or you should not do sewing product

343
00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:35,169
so this software talk about

344
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:38,230
stand aside and analytical effort to

345
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,730
so when we say but white box truck

346
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:46,410
testing so you should make passionate
shinri documentation coercive

347
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,790
hacker was no information historic
untrue because the hikers always

348
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:54,919
read all the manuals hers young Dyson
technicians

349
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:58,150
this ultimately to face a knock

350
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,230
and it turns out today day

351
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:05,669
either use catch a problem in different
places or

352
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:08,990
no or or dip the problem is not the
problem

353
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:12,490
becomes element be used in general
system

354
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,180
by there is another extreme

355
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,910
and so they made million were mistakes
said Wendy

356
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:22,150
researchers decides to her expound

357
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:26,650
his vision on the brother their vision
pros and very the right to the technical

358
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,150
documentation

359
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:31,750
and it works out and they're not
analytics neither

360
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,970
they are programming engineers and no
one else was going to use the results

361
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:39,320
this effort should

362
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,410
and in other another dimensions

363
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:47,780
this problem this coordination those who
ordered

364
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,480
so Commission to that Anderson and

365
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,660
so that many participants many
stakeholders

366
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:58,280
to the process and so they are after
different test kits

367
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,650
Thursday development manager so the
responsible

368
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:06,160
1 so this product managers process
managers

369
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,410
there's lots of other things and

370
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:14,170
so than magnetic fields worship

371
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:17,720
to always so make sure did there are no
magnetic

372
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,190
storms anyway under so than the process
engineers

373
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:27,880
you don't discuss all stakeholders and
if you don't have the city team effort

374
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:33,330
not I'll stick with a severe into steam
so there will be a lot of people on the

375
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:33,690
head

376
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:41,670
customers and that to a certain this
that might kill the project

377
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:45,940
what's this you know was this some mmm

378
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:51,390
my house this I showed it on a Web
Developers Conference

379
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:55,420
no one knew what that was up

380
00:23:55,420 --> 00:24:02,340
MCUs with orders that which

381
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,500
it's true that the developers day

382
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,690
they use different instruments and

383
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:14,470
so that the researchers know spoke about
and the use them in their own way

384
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:19,130
and a few go back a bit

385
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:22,790
a look at it. you would do I

386
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:26,380
are those who developed a compiler so s

387
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,720
so the issue differently completely
different good

388
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,650
child and so the whole for long memory
inserter

389
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:36,670
Anderson this is where this is this is
the hand of

390
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:40,350
information security so because they're
not done a

391
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,409
interested in anything else

392
00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:45,419
the same with the programmers society
thing that

393
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:48,559
so what you are her mmm

394
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,580
what you do should not be done because
it somewhere

395
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:56,350
tested solution to use instruments and
they say that

396
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:59,690
everything's fine from the instrument
pointer you're so dont

397
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:03,289
certainly not concerned and the same
with the management

398
00:25:03,289 --> 00:25:06,809
the same goals them strong diminishment

399
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:10,720
so the classical management or is it
supposed to do this to do

400
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,289
timely manner deadlines meeting the

401
00:25:14,289 --> 00:25:19,010
budget at center ice and and then
there's a certain amount of

402
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:22,460
something within for them too much but
prefer

403
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:28,029
for example so that the the security
requirement is not dear so than any

404
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:32,130
any attempt orange is iron just to make
this gadget safe

405
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,220
so we'll will fall under the years
sander

406
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,330
on mom on deaf ears and

407
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:42,230
that's why no one will be concerned
about that if it's not part 2

408
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:47,429
day for the statement the work persona
resistant to this kind of work

409
00:25:47,429 --> 00:25:51,159
awareness in the same problem there's a
big companies are riddled with this

410
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:52,020
problem as well

411
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:56,370
and me land and certainly it's

412
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:59,390
it exists in the developers community

413
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:02,809
although they understand at the issue
very well

414
00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:06,590
I'm not again just to go into greater
detail

415
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:09,850
number to at every stage

416
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:13,409
and so we have also materials

417
00:26:13,409 --> 00:26:15,620
can learn from it

418
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:19,970
and so we're a light on the attacking

419
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:23,030
methodologies public domain lists

420
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:26,250
everything only to I list them

421
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:29,460
but very important to blind them her

422
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,929
Hyundai purpose base and a needs basis

423
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:36,850
so then knowledge so when they're

424
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:40,929
I'll attach them best practices systems
that a good

425
00:26:40,929 --> 00:26:45,460
for the systems broke in practice so
then the system consists of several

426
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,450
components

427
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:50,110
for example web applications server

428
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:54,260
mile platform and certain type occur

429
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:58,679
scattered around and there's enough for
this car broker configuration there is

430
00:26:58,679 --> 00:26:59,120
no

431
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,280
a house or combine with a village in
there are some gadgets and devices that

432
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:03,840
are

433
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,780
outside programming efforts and so the
can be connected to a later stage

434
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,980
so there's this methodology to and

435
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:17,490
so than a good application dismissal
nonchalance to develop methodologies

436
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:21,070
is very interesting so the methodology
that

437
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:24,169
alas to guarantee the integrity of the
problem

438
00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:29,270
St the holistic nature the problem

439
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:32,910
then the so then this so there are some
certain some trailblazers

440
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:35,919
in dairy farmer the source

441
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,370
secure software development so Microsoft

442
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:43,280
that so what offer them and Russia ever
tried to

443
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,530
for identify what is it work what

444
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:50,630
girl to have already covered this on a
small disclaimer so they admit that

445
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:51,870
because what did publish

446
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:55,470
Microsoft some kinda reverberation

447
00:27:55,470 --> 00:28:00,730
so long so that they got about 5-10
years ago so managers are moving forward

448
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:01,659
and

449
00:28:01,659 --> 00:28:04,900
so did publish certain things in there
are some instruments

450
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:10,590
that the hair about the practice and the
way they build it do an agent and what

451
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,900
mistakes that are made

452
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:16,010
a so then the something about something
a public domain so the

453
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:21,770
they played their cars close to be chess
and they're so they're not so developers

454
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:25,510
for some exotic cases holding out for
fashionable practices

455
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:28,929
project management they do it to and a

456
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:32,679
and this is all can be found to for your

457
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:35,820
which specific case term

458
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,369
can be available

459
00:28:38,369 --> 00:28:41,820
on on this basis

460
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:45,779
them than concerning

461
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:51,950
had things two points this to phases
acid a customer requirements and design

462
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:56,369
Halford so because the requirements on
is to be a good basis

463
00:28:56,369 --> 00:28:59,710
the development but security

464
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,979
requirements the are the

465
00:29:02,979 --> 00:29:07,169
and not existent or ordered a

466
00:29:07,169 --> 00:29:10,849
related to some kind of basic primitive
cases

467
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:14,700
and they did not see the big picture for
example than

468
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,889
answer is this maturity model logging

469
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:23,009
system maturities system I to data
management maturities

470
00:29:23,009 --> 00:29:26,609
and a for actual for this seem to occur

471
00:29:26,609 --> 00:29:32,159
passe as desirable for all the
architectural components updated system

472
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:32,619
is

473
00:29:32,619 --> 00:29:36,849
so than to talk about themselves and do
it properly sold

474
00:29:36,849 --> 00:29:40,839
this practice is exist and my

475
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:44,719
most favorite case to stand it so when
this

476
00:29:44,719 --> 00:29:48,639
system I was absent in doing this to

477
00:29:48,639 --> 00:29:55,210
is the application on and there was a
presentation conference I love that

478
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,379
sir southern Andes network sniffer

479
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:02,700
for a flight protocol the system that
developed themselves

480
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:07,059
so they made the system developed a
system but failed to login system

481
00:30:07,059 --> 00:30:11,719
and to identify its conditions so they
had it and monitoring system

482
00:30:11,719 --> 00:30:15,580
editor for the DPI so they would do the
protocol standard

483
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:20,289
members nasa research will check around
the condition of the system did they

484
00:30:20,289 --> 00:30:21,469
develop themselves

485
00:30:21,469 --> 00:30:26,750
same so very interesting trip

486
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,210
down or already absence

487
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:33,850
those who do and the latex so then the
tracing

488
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:36,909
requirements is very important because
they're interconnect source

489
00:30:36,909 --> 00:30:40,399
requirement there was a server so the
server day

490
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:44,880
they strengthened it became unfold and a
balanced episode

491
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:50,940
Dave working servers and then all longus
got to %uh new address is so so so so

492
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:54,409
everything was balanced there so that
this information went to long's

493
00:30:54,409 --> 00:30:57,460
somebody forgot to change the
requirements

494
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,850
so than

495
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:04,080
now tracing the requirements issue

496
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,630
it's there it's very important

497
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:12,330
and is not to you cannot to address it
with the help of research

498
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:16,139
and started the product and service
development it's truly

499
00:31:16,139 --> 00:31:19,190
so what are the useful

500
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:23,020
mammoth its approaches as trials

501
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:26,450
am so that Microsoft to end this

502
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:29,590
back has details back retried

503
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:33,320
liked it and we're trying to stir client

504
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:38,030
possible where's awesome sound there's a
there's a poker planning

505
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:41,520
and disorder as a mother lost right
model of

506
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,340
threats this country eventuality
availability

507
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:49,179
spans this issue cancer and then that
too

508
00:31:49,179 --> 00:31:52,740
to widen your conscience the developers

509
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:57,910
can always think are which components
you need in the workers

510
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:01,820
hounds happens and especially if your
model

511
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:07,840
francis your soon architecture how the
flow data that occurs in the system that

512
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,419
would be good to do that as well

513
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:13,380
if its scale damper in your company

514
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:17,460
this is great because your hand across
functional military

515
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:21,290
personnel I send any developer will help
you

516
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:24,690
to identifies for its and

517
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:28,150
business sides good business drivers

518
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:34,660
be Stoppers

519
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:38,610
Anderson to make sure this process is
useful may be used

520
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:42,480
so the first point I always come up
against it

521
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,250
so this is generalized experience

522
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:49,540
talking about suffer certain

523
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:53,210
return on investment so they're
certainly some tangible results

524
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:56,780
returns business wants to understand

525
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,910
so to what extent so if you invest

526
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:03,820
more sources in time and the return will
be bigger

527
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:08,179
that's on the and comments security West
is not only

528
00:33:08,179 --> 00:33:12,540
money her return a although it's
important but they're talking about it

529
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:12,990
from the

530
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:16,410
under viewpoint carver

531
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:19,520
happened the so the developer and the

532
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:23,880
the calmness did for so his quite happy
time

533
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:28,080
and this is this is work day one to what
extent

534
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,970
so then the two respondent the

535
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:36,020
so to the challenges soon to what extent
they can generate

536
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:41,170
a serious crisis and for example so
that's my purse or whether through this

537
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:45,059
some time ago so the same happen here

538
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:51,460
with us so that security secure secure
development cannot be done from scratch

539
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:56,730
no one just alone realtor hiring new
people to start a new product lines

540
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:59,860
those will be the legacy products the
same people

541
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:03,809
and the need to jam to in into certain
into certain

542
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:05,950
a her

543
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:09,970
soapbox and certainly you cannot stop
from a

544
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:13,620
from time alas I it's impossible that

545
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:17,740
but you have to work in the index system
context against

546
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:20,919
existing background the conductor

547
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:24,929
than so then how to

548
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:31,360
implement her so security component into
a big company for example

549
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:35,380
so how how to introduce is how to embed

550
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:40,980
this security component to make the
entire system security measures

551
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:45,280
lots different products so we need to
streamline the products

552
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,510
Danny to to face them and

553
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:52,669
the first face most important

554
00:34:52,669 --> 00:34:57,220
those that can't wait them put them on
the back burner et cetera Financial

555
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,980
chant and and then approach

556
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,590
and then then apply this approach in all
the decision-makers

557
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:05,610
a so ask them to come out with their

558
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:09,180
ideas for their viewpoints how it can be

559
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:13,869
how it should be so how to streamline
the production with projects

560
00:35:13,869 --> 00:35:17,000
and that the first coercion my hand

561
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,290
when they just brought to India vision
how the situations

562
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:24,480
had us 3 respectable guys %ah

563
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,920
day has a cross-section so the way they
see their lives

564
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,000
and they're so they want and %uh this
the way

565
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,890
images see explains a lot so this is
number one number two number three

566
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:40,339
and that's how they view it

567
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:44,589
then you can juxtaposed compare and see
how it works

568
00:35:44,589 --> 00:35:48,309
you would and den worked

569
00:35:48,309 --> 00:35:52,819
options do we have here who could apply

570
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:56,160
min suffers with it

571
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,140
certain idea need to be developed a and
gold

572
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:03,920
salon from your pointer value marketer

573
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,020
and development talk about security
security because this

574
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:11,440
upscale security system the built to

575
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,390
independently some technological a and
to extend

576
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:18,970
here on the brought to attacks center

577
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:24,679
so when I just two to build this lineup
from scratch

578
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:27,299
Anderson and then to to predict it
worked

579
00:36:27,299 --> 00:36:30,469
where it may aunt

580
00:36:30,469 --> 00:36:34,719
and then the initial data initial data
needs to be obtained

581
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:38,709
they're all the date is wrong and it
turned

582
00:36:38,709 --> 00:36:42,179
so this raw data her temper to him

583
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:45,429
will not be this not not enough to

584
00:36:45,429 --> 00:36:50,099
sink your teeth into an A and and not
enough to make any conclusions

585
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:54,619
sound and a model mister B do the agent
separately in the specific case

586
00:36:54,619 --> 00:36:58,839
and information that we have an initial
stage will not be sufficient on the

587
00:36:58,839 --> 00:36:59,509
tentative

588
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:03,059
than or what blocks

589
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:06,189
the Diest introduction of

590
00:37:06,189 --> 00:37:09,729
new research in the area of for

591
00:37:09,729 --> 00:37:13,019
security suffering this

592
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:16,059
some some say some markets expensive for

593
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:20,139
some argue it's unpredictable some

594
00:37:20,139 --> 00:37:23,849
argue it's impossible to meet the
deadlines for the locker room

595
00:37:23,849 --> 00:37:26,869
take and so some

596
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:30,529
some argue that there's an absence of a

597
00:37:30,529 --> 00:37:34,649
powerful the yep

598
00:37:34,649 --> 00:37:40,479
Rd holistic nature on their search
who'll be properly done for me to see

599
00:37:40,479 --> 00:37:43,329
and

600
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:46,410
and ending its own probe spur ability
that

601
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:49,809
that the research will not draft-day
deal

602
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:54,029
resemble Anderson and then there's
another challenge that didn't have to do

603
00:37:54,029 --> 00:37:57,719
there they're better for I'd I to read
if

604
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:00,779
research so me love going back to square
one

605
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:03,959
and yes when the owners

606
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:07,589
assistance on this certainly want don't
want to do that onto fashion because

607
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:08,440
it's scary

608
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:13,880
and a so the response only once there
there's only one such down to do the

609
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,599
research showed initial stage

610
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,450
so when I saw not so much expense and
so2 good

611
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:23,670
so for example if they don't dust I'll
so the classical classical problem in

612
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,200
their search doesn't of tail

613
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,680
and Sun Anderson developer

614
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:33,160
case the user the user Hayes developer
sound and in your thinks

615
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,130
come up and eventually so the new
challenges generator and an

616
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:40,940
and which and then and then eventually
so this this

617
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:44,650
start hating each other sonya problems
pop-up older

618
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:48,349
their son and the people who are all
this is search

619
00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:54,799
so many to to formulate their through
and what about what about

620
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:59,479
quality sorry cannot detain any good
quality so that the key

621
00:38:59,479 --> 00:39:02,880
the keys demand is said the sustainable

622
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,609
Prosser's are continuous adapt adaptive

623
00:39:06,609 --> 00:39:08,490
adoption

624
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:13,079
adaptive molter so with the and manage
control characteristics

625
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:17,310
something so this adaptation should be
on sustainable

626
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:21,420
all the time and to make sure that the
the

627
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,440
another research should be cheaper so

628
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:28,420
to design this process so that you can
hi to rate their search and every time

629
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:32,220
and every next iteration should be
cheaper than the previous one

630
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:37,240
and they're so that would not provide
for summer radical changes in the ass or

631
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,619
some other product and went on the
compliment

632
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:43,500
what has been done earlier and to
Assad's

633
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:47,819
just don't break it down don't smash the
system just a at tinker with it

634
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:51,970
tinker with it and then then then decide
duration: process won't be

635
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:57,770
1b session expensive will not be
catastrophe every time to nature

636
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:02,510
I do some fall off on that as I and then
eventually we came to the conclusion

637
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,569
that

638
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:08,440
having alliance to the ass and so the
cycle or security development secure

639
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,390
development

640
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:14,240
and then we need to have our by their
knowledge secure development

641
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,260
cryptography included yes this is true

642
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:21,369
I'm very challenging because this is
where we

643
00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:24,520
we collect don't know how and

644
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:29,750
how work and what's the was the ass and
so on research

645
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:35,170
how it can be adapted offered to the
customer

646
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:39,089
sour technical guys so with the
development

647
00:40:39,089 --> 00:40:42,890
and how just to put it all together

648
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:46,279
so this puzzle eventually work out

649
00:40:46,279 --> 00:40:50,369
hatch the and another point

650
00:40:50,369 --> 00:40:54,999
from as taking point my point

651
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:58,220
and because security is

652
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:02,329
is it to work and %uh so that was it

653
00:41:02,329 --> 00:41:06,220
any product development so provides for
the

654
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:10,529
different roles so everyone is
responsible for

655
00:41:10,529 --> 00:41:15,830
she's on her hair and the

656
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:19,530
or so it's a team effort today it
doesn't work out that way so

657
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:22,720
should be analysts a whole

658
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,150
analyzes search for with

659
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:29,200
and so there should be managers

660
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,960
understand and dear area so then

661
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,830
everything will certain to fall into
place and the last thing

662
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:41,420
so when it's just common ground common
language so looking for

663
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:45,710
common language and stop talk about
different cases

664
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:50,010
and they're so then them have on their
ability is

665
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:53,950
weaknesses and replacement of

666
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:58,450
imports mmm et cetera how this story

667
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:04,300
tells us that and it did simplifies
communication you don't have to

668
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:08,150
to discuss why this on their abilities
dangers

669
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:13,490
the software and there were so we can
you won't have to give this sir

670
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:16,590
examples of hacking attacks in center

671
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:19,780
and decide whether there's no need
because now they're on the same page

672
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,570
understand what they mean

673
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:24,900
and so we dont I don't have to do that
ABC

674
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:28,760
from year

675
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:32,170
the legacy systems developing project to
project

676
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:36,010
throat the product and shit on and the
customer

677
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:40,070
and in the course I will not get the
idea the feeling that

678
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:44,240
they started from scratch because in
your company's

679
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,359
they just you know design you think's

680
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:52,140
the open up new laws for themselves
discovering your principles

681
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:56,560
and a happy to share it in the market so
there are three doses good

682
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,300
and for this is all based on on some

683
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:04,710
a knowledge awareness of one's own

684
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:08,800
witnesses us logically delineated

685
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,930
them so we are

686
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:16,950
now involved in this this summer I have
grounds for

687
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:21,859
optimism and the business in a moment
and follow-up development and

688
00:43:21,859 --> 00:43:24,960
and installation application in practice

689
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,700
and so I I am positive about their
quieter

690
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:35,940
optimistic what's good what's

691
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:39,599
what's in it for us and her

692
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,880
so it's a good initiative for

693
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,619
some cost which state standard for the
development of

694
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:50,589
have SeaTac yes yes it can motivate each
to the research

695
00:43:50,589 --> 00:43:55,040
beforehand it so there were

696
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,980
so then are lower as if they were
starting over the phone their abilities

697
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,990
but it was all segregated

698
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:05,430
horse a random a but not through the
camera specific lever

699
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:09,620
and that could be used her to stop
competition

700
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:14,540
tenders Bates development now because
and for example some

701
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:18,630
a tender for the development is is a
good things down because it cost

702
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:22,980
a standard to us because everyone is an
altar and

703
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:26,040
development means us her

704
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,500
contributing to the security how the
system and

705
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,360
me talk to me dinner a person Hall
understand that

706
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:37,030
the cats and their products all have so

707
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:41,140
components of security badder here

708
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:45,400
depending on the importance of and the
information to the processes

709
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,510
Federal Security Service or dings Rd

710
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:54,640
for the health system and us about the
standard disgust standard state standard

711
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,040
one

712
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,610
it is released and citing did

713
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:03,510
this year beginning next year so
expected that will be good lever

714
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:06,870
to make sure that this works done
properly

715
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:10,020
logical streamline fashion testing

716
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:15,100
research study and that could guarantee
the integrity of the system

717
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:18,860
the as a development stage

718
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:22,080
and then identity certain

719
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,820
fax so the global monitoring system and

720
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:30,250
this system is important too you know
the just-completed

721
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:35,990
circle to make it integral and us how
this is done developed

722
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:40,700
about separating so the whole life cycle
something at the lab for

723
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:44,280
can see that we need to build

724
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:48,330
to destroy and so they're nicer

725
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:52,230
shit practical security so for

726
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:56,290
in the is developing at a rapid
Minnesota companies did

727
00:45:56,290 --> 00:46:00,720
specialize in that Olympus no works in
the department's

728
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,070
big corporations but the next challenge

729
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:07,070
really I get to face these two

730
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:11,310
to make this effort to knows more
systemic more streamlined

731
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:14,350
more sustainable logical

732
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:17,880
saw them bringing and bringing Hamas the

733
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,430
the results searched for so2

734
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:25,220
so than and to stop talking who hates
home

735
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:29,349
about to stop talking harm so who can
use

736
00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:33,359
who can help home and to do this synergy
canvas

737
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:36,720
rather than Anderson featured planes
Canada

738
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,519
hamp

739
00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:44,599
and there are no option except for you
know starting doing something if you

740
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:46,059
have some questions

741
00:46:46,059 --> 00:46:50,329
on here but here so this is a car
complicated process

742
00:46:50,329 --> 00:46:54,720
that some great old activity but quite
the interesting I hope are you enjoy

743
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,609
my story so my view are

744
00:46:58,609 --> 00:47:02,789
and a I would be ready to answer your
questions

745
00:47:02,789 --> 00:47:06,009
privately I'm around under please
approach me

746
00:47:06,009 --> 00:47:07,660
I'll be happy to talk to you thank you
