1
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:05,600
special which into

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,960
special didn't broach abortion from so
thank you

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,480
for coming hand the yesterday how
reporters got slightly rougher because

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,600
we were talking

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,660
and they're so forgive our vocal cords
a.m.

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,490
not being in the perfect condition today
after yesterday so

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,830
was there to discuss the trends

8
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,980
that we have been observing over the
last

9
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:36,200
problem here sander so

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,240
does hmm who protect information

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,450
and we help them and very often we see

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,030
we feel was at Trent come

13
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,900
overt that Carson and unfortunately in
owner

14
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:55,910
area virtual losers no statistics
because I usually people

15
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:01,250
Dunlop who is today the incidence very
much and the statistics is quite

16
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,330
cooker crippled you know and the

17
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:08,010
for the last five years we have been
publishing our analytics am

18
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,680
on the basis of our research so

19
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,659
studying the into incidence penetration
tests

20
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,070
and to and studying

21
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,020
ADB's to

22
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,090
to vulnerabilities we keep

23
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,520
doing it and those around them

24
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,009
I'll provide to use a cumulative

25
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,119
analytics so the results we're going to
show you

26
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,439
you should take standoff with a grain of
salt

27
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:41,750
you know that dramatic but we're not
looking

28
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,750
especially for the vulnerabilities these
are

29
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,789
the adverse effects of our activity

30
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:52,049
so the situation might be much more
dramatic

31
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:57,020
if wheeler specific going looking for
the short

32
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,179
am so let us tell you about our research

33
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:05,849
and them

34
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:09,140
we at the authors not boris as Sir

35
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:13,290
at the agenda claims but they've been a
big team of researchers

36
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:19,379
and we shall try to are

37
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:22,670
make it a business section and a

38
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:26,319
try to talk business-wise

39
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,989
about the issues that we have been
observing so let's proceed

40
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:33,040
guess we skip the Mark Twain

41
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,430
quotation okay after the tests

42
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:50,480
we made we found a critical
vulnerabilities everywhere

43
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,690
and it was happening in each

44
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,330
and every industry cell if you say that
you buy

45
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:03,799
piles of hardware and make a Boeing a

46
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:08,739
and protect your infrastructure that
would be wrong speaking about the

47
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:09,920
perpetrators

48
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,319
virtually the they can

49
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:17,790
always get into your infrastructure
confirmed by our tests

50
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:23,209
and their our investigation incident
investigation experience in a bit

51
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:26,299
infrastructures with this simple reason

52
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:31,180
once we take a glass house

53
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,690
and tried to

54
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:39,709
protected from the children and a just
take a

55
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:43,019
something simple and its it would be

56
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:47,859
a difficult to Soto nantucket catch

57
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:53,810
everyone who all trying protected from
all sides so we see that render

58
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:58,180
process we have a virus

59
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,200
anti-virus we have no viruses we have
network attacks

60
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,370
firewalls week so it means the network
is OK

61
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:12,639
and we believe that infrastructure

62
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,720
is potentially compromised and

63
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,039
we need to cut

64
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:23,030
the timing out for the sea hackers

65
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,810
visit or identify

66
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:31,150
busy disruptions following unwanted
activities

67
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,240
purcell social you can hack everything

68
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,539
so the question is only when you find
out about it

69
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:40,630
he so

70
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,790
up the slide is showing you

71
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:47,540
the picture used are there reasons

72
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,790
houses on their abilities in this
system's and

73
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,020
on the right we see say

74
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,270
growth or decline

75
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:01,960
to previous years so the types of
vulnerabilities

76
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,980
I'll that we came across good

77
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:11,270
you should never forget that all
securities start with the person and

78
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,120
very often

79
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,850
answer exactly as they ran for instance
weak passwords

80
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,550
is served the most frequent issue

81
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,710
and the previous lives also

82
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,780
mentioned lack of chess so

83
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,040
once you're close that no

84
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,400
vulnerability but but it's still there
up

85
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,270
and Kenji me you said and year-on-year

86
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,300
the issues %uh snowballing so last year

87
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,490
are holzer remain this here

88
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,530
cool and the service no breaks rubles

89
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:49,710
he or

90
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:53,590
in the VIN number of attacks or

91
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:57,940
as a quality over text you cannot to
invent this your perm firewall

92
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,990
or Super Anti Virus at least it did not
happen last year

93
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:06,040
make this deal in my view I was
surprised

94
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,230
that say discrepancy between

95
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:15,550
saying perception of system corner and
the hackers so our customers and

96
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,660
virtually all of them which is do not
believe

97
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,740
an external perimeter is an issue
everyone

98
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:28,130
is sure that they have a beautiful
network firewall

99
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:32,020
which is set up and the presents no
issues

100
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,509
and it is so different from real life
from real

101
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:39,120
tip that it was absolutely outstanding

102
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,780
amazing if you look at those
vulnerabilities

103
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,259
this this is campus you know

104
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:51,110
apps for going on a Web site management
systems

105
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,319
unpaid to Windows machines at that

106
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,509
and keep running in the web it's not
even a boner abilities

107
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:01,650
it's a chaos in their heads

108
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:05,860
other people this is the main issue
people don't even feel it as a

109
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,440
as an issue shake

110
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,860
around knows who promise kept IT system
is there is a paradigm

111
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,970
that the external pyramid there has been
protected

112
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,280
have been protected long ago and now
where

113
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,009
a takin it to a new level but bad its
absolutely

114
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:27,099
rom's so hacker though some

115
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:30,460
have even to be smart or so

116
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:36,620
be to come inside to overcome the
external gerrymander that's the trend

117
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,199
I believe the internal system developed
pastor

118
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:43,550
them they get protected

119
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:47,229
she so and another general comment

120
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:51,870
is that the main insecurity shoes start
because people

121
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:55,099
who look at this system

122
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:58,490
immediately see say cracks

123
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,610
and them problem

124
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,750
so it was a problem is seen only

125
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:10,539
when they're intact so and resources
owner

126
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:14,060
front tend to forget the

127
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,480
it becomes of this after the incident

128
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,780
so the member the really take preventive
measures

129
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:25,320
so we bro shall presentation

130
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,320
installed for main parts

131
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,710
about critical infrastructures

132
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:36,380
first part is about the telco operators

133
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,830
South dimitri is going to share with us

134
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,110
about the seller operators or

135
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,420
so worse the root cause

136
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:50,010
ish we are all to blame mister

137
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:53,690
for the volume so so last year

138
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:58,320
koresh might have had a very interesting
presentation about social networks and

139
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,440
trend that we are leaving in the
information society

140
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,590
and I believe it needs it very

141
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:08,260
good solid infrastructure and

142
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:12,210
to very of from some transportation
networks

143
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:16,100
are the basis and on of infrastructure

144
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,530
and the it's like a Piper where

145
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:22,810
that data flows to and users

146
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,250
through broadband or

147
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,200
mile internet never think about the
security

148
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:36,310
have provided by the operator and part
of our activities

149
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:40,000
through community or additional research
shows

150
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,350
the operator infrastructure is the most

151
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,160
vulnerable part so this slideshow im

152
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,180
the information on equipment

153
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,620
that's available from the Web we wanted
to see

154
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:57,780
how safe is set to use mobile internet
usually

155
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:01,430
people are interested in some radio

156
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:05,860
interception at an interface level so
that technology isn't quite productive

157
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,430
there let's look at the other side was
so that the trunk network

158
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:13,110
and a used

159
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:16,610
we saw that there are components like
GSM

160
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:20,460
kate says is an order which is set
between the operator

161
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,760
and internet analyst Arndt

162
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,220
trying to she is such a note in the
internet search album

163
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:33,550
and collect that information shoes is
available

164
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,900
which least and churros

165
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,940
that's so many devices are available

166
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,670
through home on on protocols

167
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:49,410
and interfaces this is a vulnerability
number one

168
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:53,200
so number two is

169
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,830
word passwords password made up words

170
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:01,350
so just with Chardon we are looking for
some GSM

171
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:05,090
and find the huge number of from
available

172
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:09,740
devices identified by banners and
protocols and then we see that

173
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,760
they have for

174
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,920
wordy word says plus warrants and simple
things like that and a

175
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,530
once looked

176
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:24,260
what's so bad about it because they lol
you to penetrate

177
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,330
easily inside that operator's network
cell

178
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,560
protocols like HTTP are available

179
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,600
to transfer busy users date

180
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,780
stop sold homes

181
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,920
and 1 p.m. the hacker get there

182
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,410
so very below and trust

183
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:46,860
threshold so

184
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,340
any schoolboy can do it I don't know how
many of them

185
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:55,260
are honeypots but by operators concerns

186
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,790
I guess sounds devices

187
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:03,500
are there any chance because of
negligence or

188
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,000
by erroneous decision sold

189
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,090
wrong settings whatever and the devices
available

190
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:16,740
is all funny and hacker can get inside

191
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,380
and then get access to

192
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:24,380
any unprotected date because they're not
encrypt the

193
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,570
they're just going like openText so

194
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:31,150
interception opportunities are endless

195
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:36,170
and at acts like a blocking access
twelve-mile users

196
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:39,480
so this is all crap compared to those a

197
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,930
confidentiality loss and

198
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,490
users the weeks what else

199
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:55,670
SIM cards SIM card is a thing that said
difficult you know

200
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,529
its owners it

201
00:12:56,529 --> 00:12:59,639
manufacture can now spoil it

202
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:02,910
actually there's not much security

203
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:06,199
the issues that seem hard is a smart
device

204
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:09,309
reach is F computer was

205
00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:12,429
OS filesystem and applications

206
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:16,579
and for your time distance

207
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:19,720
in cars would not be setup

208
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,129
once but operator keeps communicating
with it to

209
00:13:24,129 --> 00:13:28,100
through different protocols and science
sending binary

210
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,259
SMS to your SIM card us hywell

211
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:34,300
assigned DNS server SMS under

212
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,939
themselves from such binary SMS any user

213
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:42,389
Kim for us send an SMS

214
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:46,319
to any other user just knowing the phone
number

215
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:50,059
Eve this %um card accept such SMS you
can try

216
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:53,749
to replace their DNS servers and

217
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:59,160
sound own data through hackers servers
and get the user's in Chrome

218
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,429
and b-sides there are so many vulnerable

219
00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:06,420
applications approximately 20 percent of
SIM card company

220
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,679
carry carry applications and their

221
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:12,980
are cholera measles there do not have
see

222
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,089
a proper signature which

223
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:19,610
is another open door for the hacker

224
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,929
up to you know installing

225
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:26,619
a new job application that

226
00:14:26,619 --> 00:14:30,279
well served as a backdoor war

227
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:35,449
in their simplest case which book

228
00:14:35,449 --> 00:14:38,009
getting access to the file systems

229
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:41,420
I'm you can get parameters like

230
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:46,459
Tim identify things and encryption key

231
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:50,230
so once you get this information you can
always clomid

232
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,369
SIM card of any user name them

233
00:14:53,369 --> 00:14:56,410
you know he can thick

234
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:01,329
messages over legitimate users so they
must have about 10,000

235
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:04,819
this money that is

236
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:09,480
would be spent by are waved

237
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,970
means to to get the keys so we

238
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:16,379
be made even trip on this she's

239
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:19,899
I'm them can be easily

240
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:24,149
don't if you ten thousand dollars worth

241
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:27,410
week of your time and then you cannot be

242
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:30,699
new SIM cards into everything andrea
koppel that

243
00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:34,809
user so oh what you can you say

244
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:39,139
is SMS banking services once the parent
traitor

245
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:42,179
is not greedy and the steel everything

246
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:46,129
still much money is that requires
confirmation but just you know

247
00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:49,490
just steel tool four thousand rubles

248
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,290
he cam

249
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:55,240
you know keep pinching as that SMS bank
and then

250
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,779
all the SMS will come back to it chrome

251
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:02,709
cell phone so so perfect way to monetize
this

252
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:06,660
their ability another interesting
researchers we made

253
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,420
is 3g/4g them stronger abilities

254
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,430
we saw another trend was

255
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,980
former most of them oldham's all

256
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,230
are will computers that

257
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,630
where some 100 Linux and

258
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:27,079
I'm mercy we get this much

259
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:32,060
SIM card modem a computer so you insert
answered answered

260
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,339
a computer in the computer and the
computer so

261
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:39,769
s for USB modems you know there are so
many ways to

262
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:43,610
and unlock burns that can

263
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:46,889
Ian use the SIM card of another greater

264
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:51,139
so when hugh do it there when when

265
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:54,790
the manufacturer striped to %um

266
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,790
differently and the first thing they did

267
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:01,730
is close sports management ports

268
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:08,500
use they tried to take on this
functionality from some console

269
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,039
management just make

270
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:15,699
word that was unable user

271
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:20,539
to set up and see his balance and
everything

272
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,809
commander was created

273
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:27,329
all vulnerabilities that are

274
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:30,840
intrinsic for Rep up to code executions

275
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,010
so as as

276
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,130
it happened

277
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,080
swept on their abilities

278
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,700
very popular arbitrators can now

279
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:48,410
identify and mold them collecting
information

280
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,800
for specific Rondo

281
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,909
handle set up do basic setup

282
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:58,520
change DNS server

283
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,580
for further data interception

284
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,770
and up to SMS

285
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:09,750
manipulations changing as a SMS center
number

286
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:15,340
and those through SMS you can change
chanda

287
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,620
I'll send the password for for

288
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:22,090
as their self service portal after all
that her

289
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,700
zia packer Cana I'll

290
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,950
just to manage septa so controls a fine

291
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:33,300
finances user and a as additional

292
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,340
vulnerability you can always upgrade
this modem

293
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:40,250
and once you upgrade to Tuesday

294
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:44,380
middleware well

295
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,940
used USB devices physically connected to
a computer

296
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:53,720
whatever their flash dryers that again
after CD-rom's

297
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,640
and water modems have acid CD-rom

298
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,980
partnership

299
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,970
to install software SD card

300
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,290
that can re as a separate extension

301
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:09,310
and you can and their driver there the
whale

302
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:15,030
connect to the keyboard SoCal watch them
as if you ever have another keyboard to

303
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,620
your computer and you can do it remotely
you don't even have

304
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:23,700
to you that physically you can just to
go to their website was a proper

305
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,820
exploiter

306
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:30,120
that it this website well come it will
send a command

307
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,370
I'm you well

308
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:36,470
use these additional keyboard to

309
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:41,030
on so marsilli send commands and control
the local

310
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:44,530
machine which is probably dream of any
hacker

311
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,780
and humans XO

312
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:52,330
a so what what you have to do is a
victim was just steps from the modem

313
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:58,170
go to their own site song and we were
looking at many modems and web site at

314
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:58,970
twenty

315
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:02,790
7 out of 30 contained a

316
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:06,660
such vulnerabilities a.m. it's something

317
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,150
laker drive-by download attacks

318
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:13,660
but the targeted at modems

319
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:17,760
not computer so when you're just visit
web web resource and

320
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,160
it is infected up

321
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,270
is a can there sent to you

322
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:30,310
that they can send you a botnet and
attack to control the modem and then

323
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,790
control your computer

324
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:38,650
up

325
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,310
so

326
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:45,670
cells are quite popular in the US and
Europe was a small base tension

327
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:49,880
that allows you to expand the macro
networks to your garage

328
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,570
or on your house

329
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:58,300
under very convenient to use get shit
but then

330
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,460
was more I am

331
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,580
believe Verizon had issues with this
because

332
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:08,160
it is a device apart costs a simple

333
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,460
hardware and the when through the
distributor network a

334
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:16,460
was them salters so individuals a lot
it's something

335
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:20,580
femtocell something tho cells

336
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:24,970
was a purchased by bad guys what writer

337
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:28,919
just to use it to get admin excess

338
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:32,789
people are very creative they found
alternative

339
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:36,049
applications to very nice device

340
00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:39,440
some the Monday saying

341
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,769
that they did to femtocell several years
ago

342
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:47,880
is getting accessed to control interface

343
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,000
and for this story says that some guys

344
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,500
with quote face in the backpack

345
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,299
to was a and just walking

346
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:02,830
around say a shopping mall

347
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:08,139
and your and intercepted calls and SMS

348
00:22:08,139 --> 00:22:12,870
so getting some sensitive information of
my by all users and their

349
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:16,070
own research shows that femtocell

350
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:19,840
used are different

351
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,409
each vendors may said different
architecture

352
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:27,740
him to sodom the femtocells that we have
been getting

353
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:31,519
well some of them were protect that
somewhere not

354
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:36,090
but we consider them as a potential
penetration point

355
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:41,840
intrusion point because this is a device
that somehow through internet on

356
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,139
tunnel and gets into the operator
network under

357
00:22:46,139 --> 00:22:51,750
them interesa was unknown to like that
that would be of interest to

358
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,559
to us and to

359
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,649
was so far

360
00:22:57,649 --> 00:23:02,830
as a broken in order to watch their
traffic

361
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:06,590
catch for yourselves and this has car
kinda fake

362
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:09,649
base stations facial up a base station

363
00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:13,559
if you use it you can intercept

364
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:17,629
that data or sleep at some random people

365
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:22,440
around you would

366
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:27,100
and ship a popular attacks are reduced

367
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,149
they protocol version from 3G when I'm
on by Oakland this trying

368
00:23:31,149 --> 00:23:35,610
to up connect to your cell

369
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:40,090
so it will check the validity it

370
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:44,820
and in 3G and 2g is different also your
chest suppress

371
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:48,549
Bay are with I'll proper operator signal

372
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:52,869
and raise your fam no sell-through 2gen
the user well-connected

373
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:56,610
and a you can pass calls and SMS and you
control

374
00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:00,330
at if you have this femtocell

375
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:03,840
you and debit p.m. you can go to their

376
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,889
with me would commit more bile both they
will show you

377
00:24:07,889 --> 00:24:14,330
how your cell phone will be downgraded
to a3 Jean van with chills Regina and

378
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:17,440
the cell phone will have to use so they
all

379
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,499
good GSM connections are still covers
eighty percent of the connection

380
00:24:22,499 --> 00:24:27,039
and them say mile station cannot
purchase

381
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,480
because the authenticity and you connect

382
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,440
to the fake network a.m. the mmm

383
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,749
be p.m. and all your data will be
interceptors

384
00:24:37,749 --> 00:24:39,159
yeah

385
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:42,959
slipped and then see you

386
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:47,299
can always suppress see availability

387
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:50,359
for connection and

388
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:53,959
big users are looser operator earned

389
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:58,469
it suspends especially sensitive the
video provide vital information

390
00:24:58,469 --> 00:25:01,739
again and this this device

391
00:25:01,739 --> 00:25:06,459
sessions can cover 100 so for square
meters and

392
00:25:06,459 --> 00:25:10,639
mission just believe the people without
any connection so why

393
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:14,459
this USB more than research was so
interesting

394
00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:17,529
because the use of such modems as access
point

395
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:23,179
to Internet my ordinary people's
probably the simplest

396
00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:26,179
way but he also

397
00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:29,309
on at the ATM there is only one tenth

398
00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:32,959
the same GPRS connection does a
processing center

399
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:36,859
and many technologists have

400
00:25:36,859 --> 00:25:40,899
work that way Internet of Things your
small biotechnology

401
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:44,059

Lord trent

404
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:54,599
yes pipelines was Rosa

405
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:57,969
ketchum sensors us

406
00:25:57,969 --> 00:26:01,459
that's clear the mainly worker by

407
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:05,979
GSM connection and in some cases 3G
products

408
00:26:05,979 --> 00:26:10,409
where necessary to arrange broadband
access to those devices but very often

409
00:26:10,409 --> 00:26:10,789
they

410
00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:16,019
indirection I'm up to knows just got a
system so would be done through short

411
00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:16,799
messages

412
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:22,149
and also owner abilities was RC here

413
00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:23,840
and

414
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,669
generally good information and present

417
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,990
and the author interesting talk

418
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:40,049
is about SSL crocodiles level

419
00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:44,070
attacks 2014 was reach in them

420
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:47,440
and lost here we were talking about

421
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,499
knows about their ability to some
luckily the German researchers

422
00:26:52,499 --> 00:26:56,590
followed up and them and ACC conference
so we

423
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:59,929
kept talking about those vulnerabilities

424
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:05,249
and them the public got excited in the
washington post a $1 wrote about

425
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:08,440
the possibility of Secrets

426
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,990
they insist this do it should

427
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:16,720
his just

428
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:22,950
cheap its such a big issue

429
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:27,700
here ish is is you

430
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:32,710
massip

dinner service attack

432
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:40,280
like for instance her can service

433
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:44,060
here's its tech once

434
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,730
denies this

435
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:50,500
in in the vicinity of business center

436
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:54,360
we ship connection this is like

437
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,700
stack hit

438
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:01,860
seventh is very seriously

439
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:05,370
temp

440
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:08,860
who sent

442
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,590

443
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:19,660
prop

444
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:24,630
me made another upgrade so that this
then broke up with her

445
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:29,460
Hughes I P networks for transport and
the trend is

446
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,210
Monday every secluded

447
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:36,330
network operators net

448
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:40,060
28 which were not but lately

449
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,290
huge number additional services

450
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:46,730

451
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:50,280
sent parties yes accessed

452
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,880
which works which enables

453
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,890
about something readers have never

454
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:01,050
before because its proper sleep

455
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:04,370
step

456
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,660
way from any

457
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,100
creation so should

458
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:14,350
you can register virtual break

459
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:21,840
up

460
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,970
says to or

461
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:28,020
traders once you get this excess

462
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:33,390
used this network like

463
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:36,870
nervous system while word so

464
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:40,200
or ways your search user

465
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,850
because here you can take your

466
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,910
he

467
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:51,790
and considering this network

468
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,940
national and roaming among all operators

469
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:00,880
become his son's

470
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,100
for you can accent

471
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,200
also user you

472
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,280
only see victims

473
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:16,420
number you can't said SMS messages send

474
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:21,830
SMS messages every user choose

475
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:26,650
up

476
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:29,970
this system one

477
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:34,130
one for instance

478
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:37,910
the password shows pollute the current

479
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:41,660
call us to confirm what occurs must push
that much and

480
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:45,820
which is have more or less protected
much

481
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:50,860
but signal a chain you can get
information from anyone

482
00:30:50,860 --> 00:31:00,310
us am

483
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:04,370
lecture asked one Nicholas clarifying
question

484
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:09,510
so can you listen to to user

485
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:12,810
located living in another country will
she get

486
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:16,310
any any bills for talking

487
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:19,400
no because he wanted to listen in to any

488
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:24,580
to any user solely we deceive the
billing system and

489
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:28,730
so we but right organizer the way so
that the billing system

490
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:33,930
a once we connect so then the conference

491
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:37,980
conference call let it will look like
conference call between 3 users

492
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:42,420
soft and sup to to good guys and bad
guys

493
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:45,880
and substantial to listen to

494
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:50,900
little between the two users had the
same time he avoiding certain numbers

495
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,970
to users be original members but when he
gets

496
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:58,770
a sobering on his cell phone

497
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:03,230
house hero you and this is kind of a
cock counterfeiting

498
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:07,600
the system modeling system so provide
any transformation

499
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,830
we can just and provide false
information or information

500
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:14,720
and that would provide false information
to the user will not get

501
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,440
any additional details period

502
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,169
and other

503
00:32:20,169 --> 00:32:24,679
is technological processes with soccer

504
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:28,220
Brittany production pearls to elizabeth
Rose

505
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,700
transportation

506
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,840
sorry any industrial sites in

507
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,859
manufacturing pursuant

508
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:41,019
so what about their own their use
vertical the agency the years

509
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:44,629
and judging by the years share for 2010

510
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:48,450
so there was no research done on
industry

511
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:51,999
industry on their militias was not done
Schobel

512
00:32:51,999 --> 00:32:55,299
and a so the idea was that is good at it
works

513
00:32:55,299 --> 00:32:58,580
so then starting from until only Miami

514
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:03,320
or went into a serious study and
learning more

515
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,969
and establishes ammunition trying to
address

516
00:33:06,969 --> 00:33:10,849
all day challengers and despite channels

517
00:33:10,849 --> 00:33:15,229
along took the vendors to him to fix

518
00:33:15,229 --> 00:33:18,710
live on their abilities the best used is
the blue sec

519
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:24,649
three months since defender is notified
so then on our ability was closed

520
00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:28,479
3 mice people is about to some other
vulnerabilities

521
00:33:28,479 --> 00:33:33,039
take for a virtual shakes which and

522
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,899
services outstanding issue surgery issue
and then it's

523
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:39,969
resolve to any time soon

524
00:33:39,969 --> 00:33:44,190
this circle Bagram make an honest see
the

525
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:48,559
visible part 2 vulnerabilities but but
unfortunately

526
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,940
so the systems cannot patches introduce
patches or updates

527
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:56,330
right away and because somebody

528
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:59,619
complexity industry

529
00:33:59,619 --> 00:34:02,759
Russian so to me sound and

530
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:06,169
another technological window when did
patch maybe

531
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:10,210
may be installed its sometimes requires
a year so on

532
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:13,899
before just swing the opportunity comes
up and then

533
00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:18,409
you can do that so this is because
specifics on the technological process

534
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:21,480
so they cannot do it faster

535
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,779
earlier to the statistics his

536
00:34:24,779 --> 00:34:27,980
yet understand what it means

537
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:32,230
because the number of on their abilities
in the last three years since the

538
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,299
uptrend

539
00:34:33,299 --> 00:34:36,309
hits go Stuxnet

540
00:34:36,309 --> 00:34:40,770
when everyone learned about and so than
they were last night to think in terms

541
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:42,000
of on their ability

542
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,329
honors didn't and didn't look for it and

543
00:34:45,329 --> 00:34:50,179
so there is no a plan roses study hall

544
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:53,760
I'll so companies from on their
abilities

545
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,950
homes ish software producers

546
00:34:56,950 --> 00:35:00,480
former owners they don't canister and

547
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,359
Sun and the defenders and it turns
developer some industrial systems

548
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,380
corporate systems so they did not check

549
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:11,500
on their bills this is kind of random

550
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,720
random looking for on their abilities

551
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,130
it's not a sustainable this which aren't
sure how many

552
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:22,549
gadgets hunting tournament she s

553
00:35:22,549 --> 00:35:28,279
then the best in their disruption on but
lecture with my liberators

554
00:35:28,279 --> 00:35:31,450
mistakes of integration

555
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:34,720
so this simplification networks center

556
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,730
sometimes it's only one controller
sometimes is data center

557
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:42,520
and should go and on the latter's in
numbers

558
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,730
and you can see that the United States
whose

559
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:49,780
have the world not because started to
write reviews

560
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:53,740
so this system much Hirlap

561
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,760
miss my day there much more times

562
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:01,420
have cement

563
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,920
and on the right hand so you can see
this charge

564
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,960
Austin on their mobile them on their
abilities

565
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,569
sign in Germany but 3 percent of gadgets

566
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:14,910
internet system also been taking care

567
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:18,780
much about things China chan is not due
until after search

568
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:24,569
less than some thirteen hundred years
hinterland and

569
00:36:24,569 --> 00:36:28,880
and and half of them are all normal

570
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,230
so means that there aren't many the same
times does get a sample

571
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:36,339
configured should and Saudi

572
00:36:36,339 --> 00:36:40,109
implications a great friend so there is
a parade

573
00:36:40,109 --> 00:36:43,920
for grizzled accents are Russian

574
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,450
turkeys mild

575
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:50,590
I am this so they're pretty much just
seems a little number of gadgets

576
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:54,500
internment she and the level of security
does

577
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,880
how those gadgets Russia his Turkish

578
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,950
so there are quite a few gadgets but
they're not protected

579
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:05,950
not secure and so then

580
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:12,510
some countries less than 10 percent of
gadgets are vulnerable some countries

581
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:15,690
20 percent gadgets are vulnerable

582
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:19,570
and this other countries where China
everything so bad

583
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,760
so have a gadget his his phone

584
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,230
so for me this is the saddest slide

585
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:32,700
this so when we do that this research
first time salut les autres pays

586
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,870
on the Internet so what about dr. secure

587
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:39,780
networks think about it and and

588
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:46,430
so think about the Packers you are so
we're sending information to other

589
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,240
countries

590
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,420
nothing his nothing's changing

591
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:54,540
would want

592
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:59,090
you walkable wasn't

593
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:03,579
here top the real issues

594
00:38:03,579 --> 00:38:06,750
social we may face so Brent the

595
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:11,160
mount against operations

596
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:16,890
the leaders for the environment

597
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:21,210
get great implications 303 computer

598
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:27,910
addition equipment is required I'll for
example dusty

599
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:36,400
changing for OCS on the railway trip

600
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:43,459
then financial structures he plans to
talk to each other

601
00:38:43,459 --> 00:38:47,630
and Ashley sure to remit money money
remittance

602
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:52,219
much Anderson are trying to make sure
that your services

603
00:38:52,219 --> 00:38:55,679
convenient like this

604
00:38:55,679 --> 00:39:00,269
the lows main in security and it's only

605
00:39:00,269 --> 00:39:03,619
promoter banking service

606
00:39:03,619 --> 00:39:06,799
78 percent

607
00:39:06,799 --> 00:39:10,449
large this hi high level of risk

608
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:14,140
which and bear arms burst didn't think
well

609
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:17,390
develop school systems he said means
that it should take

610
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:20,559
the box solution so then

611
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:24,559
the chance should more protected than

612
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:29,209
if you develop it yourself exercise
security security wise

613
00:39:29,209 --> 00:39:32,369
spent trust frictions because the

614
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:37,939
hearse the how to the box solution so
much better than 40 percent

615
00:39:37,939 --> 00:39:41,199
cases to us the miscreant

616
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:46,130
so can't authorized axis to any personal
data

617
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:49,769
Council day bank accounts

618
00:39:49,769 --> 00:39:53,999
and and 13 percent home cases

619
00:39:53,999 --> 00:39:58,149
third 13 percent of times so the the
miscreant

620
00:39:58,149 --> 00:40:01,459
handle the shows

621
00:40:01,459 --> 00:40:05,380
other people's accounts directly up

622
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:08,499
and then so then the same functions

623
00:40:08,499 --> 00:40:11,690
mom I'll banking is very popular

624
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:14,860
which share me has its own low

625
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:17,990
cations yes Android

626
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:21,610
implications were tested G and someone

627
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:25,750
half-hearted applications certain
problems show

628
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:28,940
sugar boastful a which can be hacked

629
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:33,180
easily has nothing to do with up

630
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:36,760
with what the user wants doctrine
concise on droid to

631
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,010
whose his mom on the herbal than Ohio's

632
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:43,740
the store as a seventy-percent than you

633
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:48,620
spit a bunker application so they're
checking

634
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:52,230
so the other group cell phones because
snot

635
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:55,680
rupert cell phones we cannot do there

636
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,849
templates statements

637
00:40:58,849 --> 00:41:01,650
but not a rounded

638
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:05,499
sound the program's would may be doing
it

639
00:41:05,499 --> 00:41:09,809
but im some know you can pay about
online databases

640
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:13,219
his are certain templates that's you

641
00:41:13,219 --> 00:41:16,959
greater in a safe manner times thing at
this a small

642
00:41:16,959 --> 00:41:20,699
antivirus persistent that will prevent
you from

643
00:41:20,699 --> 00:41:23,880
installing these applications on your
cell phone

644
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,809
but you need to remember that now them
about banking is not safe

645
00:41:27,809 --> 00:41:30,890
dan

646
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:34,209
dan and high temps

647
00:41:34,209 --> 00:41:37,789
visible from internet yeah because

648
00:41:37,789 --> 00:41:41,380
by Kamsa so they

649
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:45,459
the are equipped with Windows XP and

650
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:49,130
updated it's not terrible supported

651
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:53,660
so Pakistan's rushers

652
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,070
second place

653
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:59,560
because his all day teams can be visible
from the internet

654
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:03,500
so for example

655
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:07,150
where an ATM machine this

656
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:10,430
in manners because the name called a
bank

657
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:14,230
holds site immersion ages 7

658
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:17,599
pages 7 ATM's

659
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:22,859
could be seen online after do it is a
cation 133 a scenes

660
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:27,950
banks are thinking about this purity so
because I cameras money in this

661
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:32,260
done and take measures to to make them
safe

662
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:35,800
mcdyess Lachelle stepped

663
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,960
not prepared those attacks should

664
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,430
truck if you can get a nexus to the ATM
machine from the internet to suck and

665
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:46,660
what can be done with this idea much

666
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:50,849
can easily you can easily see what can
be done

667
00:42:50,849 --> 00:42:55,640
workers who has online taxes champion
can give you any money

668
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:59,380
you don't have to have an hour to him
and hippocampus

669
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:02,440
through their home on our ability using
this software

670
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,490
in the night emotions me millions

671
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:10,210
can give you money and media resources

672
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:15,300
them soccer frequented

673
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,560
and disorder and a mass media website
security

674
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,320
so sixty-eight percent of all systems
have vulnerabilities

675
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:26,570
high-level risk a two-run person systems
how so

676
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,910
developed in and PHP contain

677
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:35,880
critical dangers on the religious an 89
percent on their abilities

678
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:40,180
so are caused by the mistakes the
program called

679
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:43,180
down eleven percentile now

680
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:49,170
were failures are related to the and
current configuration of web

681
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:53,530
applications and site administrators
work batter

682
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:57,860
and programming programmers programming
engineers

683
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:02,030
almost 90 percent on their abilities so
it could be

684
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:04,020
be fixed

685
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:07,109
if you're properly develop called and

686
00:44:07,109 --> 00:44:11,099
before before you put the site such
aggressive

687
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:14,440
dangers environment as Ginger these

688
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:19,180
gonna that the resources that everyone
visits

689
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:22,510
it's it's it's in there it's a wagers
your

690
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:26,619
do harm to the user and it's a good
chance

691
00:44:26,619 --> 00:44:31,000
so 15-17 percent of the agencies

692
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,470
be notified last 3-4 years

693
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:38,750
there dear her cement 15

694
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:42,589
large news agency sites in the Russia
Sunday

695
00:44:42,589 --> 00:44:45,650
day they provide their own cold want

696
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:49,400
me I'm and so you can see some printers

697
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,520
can see the news about new anti-virus
vendors

698
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:56,970
and all the way up to unique 1 million
unique visitors

699
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:00,940
that visit their source and people were
attacked

700
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:06,059
hope those who visited and decide the
banking try on

701
00:45:06,059 --> 00:45:09,539
Myers was inserted them

702
00:45:09,539 --> 00:45:14,680
then determines completing power surge

703
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:19,960
do it this hell have with magazine that
cost a research

704
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:24,369
Saunders researchers on researchers are
presented

705
00:45:24,369 --> 00:45:28,330
and the more comprehensive and detailed
minutes and then

706
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:32,140
from to view into for here are

707
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:36,450
almost call corporate her customers

708
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:40,000
and bank still account calls industry

709
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
so the they the very fashionable

710
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,840
to to protect themselves from from
attacks from hacking attacks

711
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:51,800
so this is so let's find some smart

712
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:56,500
machines that would identify 0 days in
fine

713
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:01,190
hackers and and so then the this trend
has been around the world

714
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:04,830
sometime it's coming to russia's that's
fine 0 Dekker's

715
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:09,210
et cetera so then and there are so
producers and

716
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:12,650
consultants whole have with a

717
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:17,170
this competences at the same time and
business in the last three years

718
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:21,440
so there's a there's his request for a
real protection real security

719
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,839
discuss years it was is the demand for
security on paper

720
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:31,609
paper security sunday just to give you a
paper and everything is fine to give a

721
00:46:31,609 --> 00:46:34,500
certificate this is security in paper

722
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:39,040
they're not happy with it anymore so at
is the background to more attacks and

723
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:43,839
and more checking accounts and so that
is why they don't want to over one just

724
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:48,440
security on paper but the real security
on to develop a system that will be

725
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,589
functional efficient

726
00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:53,089
and really protect the company a and

727
00:46:53,089 --> 00:46:57,550
that itself has that trend to so when
you when you step for

728
00:46:57,550 --> 00:46:59,290
Hana

729
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:03,470
when you step with you naked full to on
the sort

730
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:06,630
some this on Hong Kong hun

731
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:11,490
on the one hand this Sunday now so they
want the zero-day sophisticated systems

732
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:14,610
but on the other hand so did not even
take the most

733
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:19,000
simple precautions so like keeping
European cold or just

734
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,070
and being careful when you're when
you're

735
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:25,860
compaq cashing your credit card center
you

736
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:29,960
and people don't pay attention to their
and ended most recent round

737
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:33,870
his I know which is that in recent years

738
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:39,030
so the task was to protect to protect
it's not just the second in importance

739
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:39,810
because

740
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:43,980
object with some possible just to be a
protected 100 percent so we're not

741
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:45,380
protect ourselves

742
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:50,640
but at least 22 to identified the bad
guys soon as possible

743
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,240
has to stop you from doing more harm
stadia

744
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,630
and I guess not even to protect there is
no such thing as

745
00:47:57,630 --> 00:48:01,290
sharing real-time and for example some
measures

746
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:04,650
a real-time attack identification a

747
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:07,650
us are tracing center but

748
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:12,750
hitless if you for example you find out
who did it half a year after

749
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:17,150
has been hacked it's a really good and
so that's in your tremendous fundamental

750
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:18,160
trying just to get

751
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:22,260
to those guys and the underground try
and

752
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:25,910
there so they're watching the industry
very closely in

753
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:30,350
can see about them down to ground his
watching two technologies while some

754
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:31,270
time ago

755
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:37,630
ass so we had the same software

756
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:40,959
and that encrypts computers and

757
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:45,499
demands money now they're using go to

758
00:48:45,499 --> 00:48:49,880
crypto resistant algorithms sound and

759
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:55,130
so than encryption open with an open key
and I should end the industry was

760
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:58,899
prompting the attackers what not to do
so-what

761
00:48:58,899 --> 00:49:04,380
what mistakes not to make her and how to
increase the damage for the industry so

762
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:06,289
they were just supply information

763
00:49:06,289 --> 00:49:11,659
to the bad guys so that the new vendors
publication started to appear because

764
00:49:11,659 --> 00:49:15,099
vendors want to know their comp show
their confidence

765
00:49:15,099 --> 00:49:18,249
into their computers their knowledge on
transpose

766
00:49:18,249 --> 00:49:22,699
good cryptographic the second trend is
that the vendor sir

767
00:49:22,699 --> 00:49:27,509
so they say some way might do have to
pay if it's very is it incurred to be

768
00:49:27,509 --> 00:49:28,219
cryptic

769
00:49:28,219 --> 00:49:32,769
the second chance only can't gurantee
faced a good grip cover for them and

770
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:37,219
they're saying I restored to key because
it was generated on the heck machine

771
00:49:37,219 --> 00:49:38,769
that was sent by mail

772
00:49:38,769 --> 00:49:43,009
Center at so they're under Showalter
that that the bad guy

773
00:49:43,009 --> 00:49:47,619
sir can do more don't get to work more
efficiency and and the american chopper

774
00:49:47,619 --> 00:49:48,469
dear sir

775
00:49:48,469 --> 00:49:51,829
and people will not be able to restore
the day this and then it goes to the

776
00:49:51,829 --> 00:49:53,659
server so than open key

777
00:49:53,659 --> 00:49:58,399
her and groups and the and it closed key
does not get puncture dished

778
00:49:58,399 --> 00:50:03,519
into the system which has been hacked
and on the machine that has been hacked

779
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:07,709
hunter and even having special equipment
you cannot restore the key

780
00:50:07,709 --> 00:50:11,630
and it was used for the encryption and
and restore the data

781
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:14,939
I have to do is set to race first away

782
00:50:14,939 --> 00:50:19,559
is to pay and and are so take it from
the backups

783
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:20,310
you

784
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:24,030
there is a backup my for restoring from
a

785
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:27,250
have the cupcakes it takes several days

786
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:32,540
and yes that's why offices where
thousands of people were

787
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:36,330
so they were just doing nothing eating
bananas and apples

788
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:40,960
wild information is restored some some
companies went bankrupt

789
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,880
because so for example the Indian dick

790
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,220
reporting accounting was

791
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:53,120
was hacked never returned trying to
extort money

792
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:57,230
extort money from a from the company
sand and there are some cases fun

793
00:50:57,230 --> 00:51:02,390
when the law enforcement half certain
states are so they do their own

794
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:03,540
investigation

795
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:06,860
trying to identify who was that

796
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:10,350
and Anderson and define the vendor

797
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:13,800
event there stats her writing on the
block

798
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:17,130
so this is good source bad guy PHL

799
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:20,330
Peter just from that country and and and
and

800
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:24,120
church immediately packs his suitcase in
most another continent

801
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:27,730
Paso further awareness impossible to get
him

802
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:31,950
and then the high road still warned a
vendor's

803
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:35,430
ahora who really just try to understand

804
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:40,180
want had to us and send a specific so
did mister before just use that to

805
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:44,380
to a PR yourself sir assortment

806
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:47,520
think so how much effort and money just
another her

807
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,270
pass a special ages spent in toker

808
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:55,250
in order to trace them down pass out the
bad guys and improve the system in

809
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:55,770
general

810
00:51:55,770 --> 00:52:02,279
and another and using some anonymous
payments because

811
00:52:02,279 --> 00:52:05,160
so used to be a somehow pay

812
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,789
with money yes because now they started
to watch them on

813
00:52:08,789 --> 00:52:12,309
as a trace increasing demand some people

814
00:52:12,309 --> 00:52:17,579
and went to the internet which is an
anonymous

815
00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:20,960
which is not index my ID search engines

816
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:25,339
and it's much more difficult to find and
I think that

817
00:52:25,339 --> 00:52:29,740
many incident investigation should be
done within the framework of

818
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:34,539
Inc and a and provide information in the
amounts and

819
00:52:34,539 --> 00:52:38,109
hand entirety network talk about this
problem

820
00:52:38,109 --> 00:52:41,109
so that the whole herself the

821
00:52:41,109 --> 00:52:47,069
software should know what's going on but
not to give additional chances to the

822
00:52:47,069 --> 00:52:48,480
bad guys to increase

823
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,730
deficiency out there attacks

824
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:55,160
geopolitics something that was played
out always

825
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:59,670
and we ahead for the Western companies

826
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:04,039
attacks and and and is on the road
domain our ass you

827
00:53:04,039 --> 00:53:07,230
zone rights organizations could come to
terms

828
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:10,400
and a date tak Russian companies since

829
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,990
quite similar but sometimes tutors work
comp domains

830
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:18,359
Rd sores demands and so this confusion
and

831
00:53:18,359 --> 00:53:22,980
and personal communication between two
countries playing a

832
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:26,269
place playing into the hands so did
attackers and then another

833
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:29,339
and now the trend so than

834
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:33,569
Apte experience anti AP to experience

835
00:53:33,569 --> 00:53:37,390
some ass attacks more so than a Troy and
I

836
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:41,319
viruses distribution me down attacks

837
00:53:41,319 --> 00:53:45,430
aimed at specific infrastructure or
regions or

838
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:49,839
industries then that very often

839
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:53,660
pass a few years ago so MD in fact that
the website

840
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:58,900
they wouldn't factor and banking try and
send by mail do with the tax Pacific

841
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:00,079
infrastructures

842
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:04,190
now the trend his skirt is mixed

843
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:07,460
occurs de Boer experience of

844
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:11,619
Harper are more qualified and better
prepared

845
00:54:11,619 --> 00:54:16,109
partners and their very regular CE

846
00:54:16,109 --> 00:54:20,130
very smart attacks that look like their
massive tax

847
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:23,859
guy just visit society and decided that

848
00:54:23,859 --> 00:54:27,460
data transfer him to the in fact
software

849
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:30,980
but we've seen it backs away Hindi and
detuning

850
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:34,289
structure so that doctor so the hand
addresses so

851
00:54:34,289 --> 00:54:39,049
government dresses banking addresses and
in fact its software was

852
00:54:39,049 --> 00:54:43,349
delivered only if an active the people
just wouldn't visit

853
00:54:43,349 --> 00:54:48,759
the site from and from other
organizations and

854
00:54:48,759 --> 00:54:53,099
for example this is it coming from IP
addresses so that belongs to

855
00:54:53,099 --> 00:54:57,309
and the government over another status
so then the

856
00:54:57,309 --> 00:55:01,410
delaware is distributed but they should
come from

857
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:05,259
from wrong parameter stand and decide
behaves differently and

858
00:55:05,259 --> 00:55:09,400
and does not to distribute demo at whose

859
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,099
