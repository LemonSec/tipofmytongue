so we have for the ansel

13
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,610
I i would like to have some questions

14
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,899
and after this we'll goals for questions
will speak about security of course

15
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,070
and investment in security but was my
question will be very simple and

16
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:53,660
straight

17
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,739
everyone need to tell about biggest

18
00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:00,719
the your biggest security nightmare

19
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,110
personal biggest security is not

20
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:10,710
okay you need to use microphones

21
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,170
about shorts really need to be flat okay

22
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,780
so but they reached one ward but I
notice israeli report when is the

23
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,440
biggest

24
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,000
security and I exactly like Papa says
the securities were

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,580
yeah so %uh but maybe just a before I
tell you about my night meryl tell you

26
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,080
it but

27
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,140
to play but but JVP because I don't sure
that everyone is familiar with the

28
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,810
with our firm soldiers in venture
partners is

29
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,290
I'll to VC firm we've been around for 22
years

30
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,229
a we manage about 1.2 billion dollars
I'll we've invested in about two hundred

31
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:44,200
ten companies we've had the

32
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,479
28 their notable exits 12 IP o's all of
them on us toxic cinnamon a

33
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:53,920
for total transaction value about the
eighteen billion dollars and the

34
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,440
we are investing in cyber security since
2001

35
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,760
I last saw the names that the No when
typically people here but

36
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,720
exits sought to lower lip that but some
things that you might be familiar with

37
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,179
so company called cyber Ark which we is

38
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:14,320
probably while the hottest the companies
today on the stock

39
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,950
traded about two billion dollars is our
latest the IP on cybersecurity

40
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:22,550
I and later sexy to

41
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:27,110
another exit at Whitley recently in
cybersecurity company close active

42
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,370
that we are sold to a big

43
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,580
are couple weeks ago so my

44
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,570
my biggest night marceau personally I
absolutely a

45
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,670
only I

46
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,720

49
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,300

but the I in any case the so four times

55
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,280
but I I I know those four times and

56
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,700
up one of my my companies actually is
dealing with software that is able to

57
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,739
detect such a

58
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:24,660
man in the middle and I Marcel are in
the wifi hi Jer hijacking kind of %uh

59

61
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:29,610
Dept

62
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,700
I but in any case so my my

63
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,370
in on my previous trip to China I

64
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,510
had another some some galaxy phone okay
which job

65
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:44,320
was attacked as well and while I was in
China

66
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,519
and a arm you know I tried to

67
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:52,980
do different things that you might
expect from laymen kinda for user

68
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,920
including the resetting its going back
to factory defaults not about work

69
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,870
when i fat finally got so my article
guys to take care of it

70
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,130
Nova found that probably overnight I was

71
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:08,459
keeping it open or whatever a new
version of an operating system was

72
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:09,620
installed on the phone

73
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,940
I all the way back to our I

74
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,949
you know it looked like a the latest
Android version but the truth really

75
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:17,479
wasn't

76
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:21,459
so that was my personal latest pain

77
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:25,310
with a cybersecurity have no no I
understand each time what is the trip to

78
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,900
foreign countries throughout

79
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,770
fallen by now so sleep tonight so good
way to work later 10

80
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:37,930
this to keep going more by Lynn district
official at like to introduce myself I

81
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,479
hope for school conditioner

82
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:44,340
basically the helper new companies new
start-ups to develop a business region

83
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:49,130
in russia and in the world I'm currently
have about 40 a company s

84
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:52,720
that has a residency status and that
before

85
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,150
words that make project in cybersecurity
and do well

86
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,560
News Service acute to religious a and

87
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,250
if we're talking about night mass my
personal nightmare

88
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,910
but with two weeks ago my an email
account was broken

89
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,780
by cocked and pull basically all the
contact I

90
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,030
have in my in mailbox receive some wires
messages

91
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:21,889
maybe not all but many of them that will
and I received a

92
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:26,990
a phone call basically early in the
morning about 70 6 a.m. when we're

93
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:31,340
my friend was calling concerning that my
there are a lot of Wisniewski's

94
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,280
a certain days going from my no

95
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,830
mailbox I'm so I

96
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,970
probably spent several hours to excuse
tumor

97
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,419
to to send excuse letters to my
partner's next day

98
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:49,580
so it was kids happens for over two
weeks ago so it was a little

99
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,370
its was quite to quite tool it it was
like it upset me

100
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:58,669
certain Jeff you have too many letters

101
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:03,150
too many nightmares so I used to be a CT
0 for networking Nova

102
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:08,330
company that had only hackers and we had
about 65,000 machines on the network

103
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,990
which meant sixty 4,999 problems

104
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,570
mine of course was perfect so I think
that I think that the cost of a all

105
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,220
these

106
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,289
shows is not the cost of your ticket

107
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:24,650
it is the cost to the fact that I must
buy this and when I go home this goes in

108
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,289
the trash

109
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:28,560
in the airport you can have it because
it's garbage

110
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,789
because this has been compromised
absolutely the question

111
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:36,640
so on the night person are that I had
that I was involved with us a little bit

112
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,099
different

113
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:41,820
which is we found that approximately one
year ago that anonymous a decided to

114
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,700
take down the route name servers

115
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:48,700
the net and so we and Cisco got together
with packet Clearing House

116
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,740
and we built the socially some gps-based

117
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,760
packet time staffers that also tracked

118
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,960
ingress to the network from where these
packets came

119
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,610
at various Cisco on our souls and packet
Clearing House worked on

120
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,260
65 peering points and you'll notice that
on may 1st

121
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:10,130
the root name servers for fun anonymous
did not grow the fact that they lost

122
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:14,190
this round so that was a nightmare
scenario

123
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,340
which did not come to pass but they're
plenty more out there

124
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,800
so with that past you me home

125
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,789
so when you're talking about bezel
nightwear for some reason all the

126
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:26,330
personal night misuse William

127
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:30,419
related to my wife IT tools so that's
like

128
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:34,810
your email account which both cock too
and then

129
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,130
spread it out all day you know be able
to spot might set that up

130
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:41,610
so the satellite it till are Hill I'll

131
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,460
tablet saw lost time I hate to repair he

132
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,880
show my Google walk which was again a
cock by someone

133
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,550
thought for some again for some reason
tonight which is the reason why you got

134
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:56,580
this didn't decision new Nigeria game
and Management Inc almighty tools

135
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,260
exactly

136
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,870
for be a big I have

137
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:03,190
it a so again but because my wife
actually be just so you know typical

138
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:07,259
typical user in this industry so I would
imagine that sub

139
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:10,280
such kind of personal nightmare
everybody hears here in

140
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,630
but talking about my personal nightmare
ok im not talking about 80 tools

141
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:18,180
this actually a mark each Inc because
the

142
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,100
is the you can see it is we can see on
the market and when I'm talkin to

143
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,199
by Northwest customers that senator
there's a huge

144
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,639
got up between a titt in the market Inc

145
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,289
ended its can be altered and is because
when that

146
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:35,669
win every bite you every 10 for you is

147
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:39,070
region 100 times it they about

148
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:42,990
back yes you got some kind of you more
detail of weed

149
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:48,800
and then you really don't care bout your
a deal security at all level or go deal

150
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,620
okay how you can be successful doubled
acceptable to any kind of attack

151
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,740
in that city later Apple for every one
of us so we moved to next so

152
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,339
one what specific requirements or set
the requirements

153
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:05,620
you when the you pick up to investing
security company

154
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,800
it is more

155
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,170
so to some different from all it is the
same

156
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,880
what's actually your specific on what
specific requirements

157
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,040
stuffing the cyber

158
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,600
security is a bit different than other
categories that we invest and reinvest

159
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,610
also in

160
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,760
media technologies towards and

161
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,880
cloud technologies but I think cyber is
a bit different

162
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,210
so first goal p.m. you

163
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,490
you see at home and we reviewed

164
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:40,290
about 300 companies in israel in cyber
security over the last

165
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:45,480
two years we invest in eight which is
actually quite a high ratio typically we

166
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,710
invest in one percent of the company's
we see here it's more than 2 percent

167
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:53,730
I so I think that in cyber

168
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,960
there's up first four different
distribution of the

169
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,890
quality or the potential size of
companies that you see

170
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:05,950
so you knowing other categories you have
a normal distribution

171
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:10,810
see have you know few bad ones a very
few good ones and a very fat belly

172
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:14,860
in the middle which we typically try not
to invest in okay try to add

173
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,520
identify the good ones cyber because the
hype cycle over the last

174
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,800
the few years you have a lot of up
ultimately

175
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,710
mediocre Minas kind of companies that
are really

176
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,790
Nova might have good technology but it's
really point

177
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:32,360
technology meaning that they solve a
very niche very

178
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,400
short-sighted kind of a solution it's
not a platform and what we're trying to

179
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:36,990
look at

180
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,360
when we're investing in cyber security
is the platform potential so companies

181
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,210
that can really become a platform rather
than point solutions

182
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:48,030
to solve any specific kind of problems
that's one thing second is that we

183
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,790
actually

184
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,810
universe quite a bit and drilling down
into the

185
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:56,640
technology unlike other categories and
as was mentioned by my colleagues here

186
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,580
in Cisco

187
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:01,090
from Cisco you know marketing does its
job

188
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:04,940
also on the vendor side in cyber
security but we don't believe that it's

189
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,330
a

190
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:09,480
you know from our midst or G it's not
enough so whereas in other categories

191
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,270
like internet mobile and so forth
marketing can really be a

192
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:15,580
par multiplier for certain a I

193
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,720
companies in cybersecurity win for
storming hardcore

194
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,350
I technologies the first thing that
we're looking for is really

195
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:28,160
companies that have the potential to arm
introduce a part-time shift:

196
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,970
I into the market on cybersecurity

197
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:35,130
a let me give you an example and without
my bill

198
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:38,710
I'll pass the mic so one of my latest
companies

199
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:42,260
called say active is a company's a try
to

200
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:46,870
predict devolution of my hours on the
internet we all know that nineteen and

201
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,390
plus percent among our

202
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:52,590
are reusing components from previous
document actually there was never even

203
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:56,310
a single attack chain that was
documented were all the components were

204
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,110
completely new

205
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,260
okay so there's always reels the
question is what

206
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,920
and that's the basis of the inequality
the Texas from economic perspective

207
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,380
between the attacker and defender

208
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,170
it's cheap to attack course the two
different right I

209
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:12,530
so what if we can take that advantage
away from the attacker

210
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:16,340
what if we can prevent them from reusing
any component

211
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:20,720
what if we can't predict all or the
space a vault

212
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,830
possible permutations of known attack
tools

213
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:27,680
that will increase dramatically the
course the economic cost of launching an

214
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,210
attack

215
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:31,710
okay and we'll put a lot of potential
targets

216
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,660
such as my colleagues wife away from the
being cost-effective

217
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,740
for an attacker to actually attack so
that

218
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,470
you know if someone was able to do that
that's a part-time shakes shift in the

219
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:42,980
industry

220
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:50,930
so that's what we're looking for in in
in companies

221
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,700
at Squires was quoted its was really
interesting

222
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,320
BBB you on startups from dick a little
bit different point of view

223
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,920
are close to people looking for teams
that to can create

224
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,510
Road exit complete but mentions the
market and from

225
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:09,930
this point to for you arm before us is
very important technology in signs the

226
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:10,970
ground from the team

227
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:15,070
so you for and two significant a
complete adventures its broad it could

228
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,350
happen on another point that

229
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:20,950
the most important issue the face that

230
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:24,709
you product is faces on the way to a
small segment of the market

231
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:29,589
the potentials this company you know I'm
in sales but its revenue contention is

232
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:33,970
ok well is usually quite limited and as
a reasonable looking for

233
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:37,029
as a about unit is to use this
technology make

234
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:40,760
probably make platform on on the bases a
core technology

235
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,820
I and the there is a

236
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,680
and to be spent time two min basically

237
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,360
with it opportunities regarding in his
certification is

238
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,490
by a brisk paperwork that's support
industry

239
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:59,410
hours to introduce new product companies
require

240
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:03,450
lot of paperwork a lot a certificate
known him

241
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,839
or program security in this is quite
important issues

242
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,050
to I to explain the customer that

243
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:14,100
the board exactly what the risk is and
houses risk

244
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,810
could cost to the company and for
basically for many

245
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:22,420
for many I belief in in my opinion from
a knee new products

246
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,029
customers at that Kut

247
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:30,330
you've got customer doesn't didn't had
hasn't have this problem

248
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:35,540
hasn't lost basically money they not
ready to pay all maybe in

249
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,649
will be reluctant be so the this issue
soon as possible

250
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:44,190
to to be considerate so

251
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:48,779
what we look for is something which also
was like an ABC for disruptive

252
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:51,589
technology but what we're really
investing in as the team

253
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:55,589
because as you all know there's plenty
of bullshit to go around marketing guys

254
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:59,560
engineering guys who tell you how great
they are but the argument do with that

255
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,579
we follow is

256
00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:04,240
about ninety percent of the guys who
tell you how great they are have no clue

257
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,240
and to the reality is that either you
your

258
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,819
and I find it interesting I read in the
paper that the US army is training

259
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:16,949
soldiers to be cyber warriors the
average soldier has as much knowledge of

260
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,329
computer science as I happen there a
surgery

261
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:23,430
so the reality of the situation is as we
look for Team Up Guys

262
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:27,480
who have it in their DNA so I ask you
guys a question

263
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,910
the person who is really good security
is not a security guy

264
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:34,769
he is a generalist guy who knows
operating systems

265
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:39,180
networking compilers languages
distributed systems

266
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,209
the fundamentals of how operating
systems are built

267
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:46,190
and how they're actually deployed and it
is always the friction point between

268
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,300
an API an interface to the kernel

269
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,930
that with the network interface it's
always that little interface

270
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:56,060
where you find an interesting
opportunity or an issue

271
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:01,110
and it's very hard to find guys who you
say I am in languages guy but now I'm

272
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,959
doing security

273
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:05,519
no you're not if you're a guy who was
from the age of

274
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,459
15 grown up playing with OS with
networking with language is the

275
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:10,130
compilers

276
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:13,300
you know but is very hard to find those
guys

277
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:18,120
and so what we actually invest in our
guys when we find a team who have those

278
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,720
guys

279
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,040
they know and they know more than me so

280
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,430
that's what we really look for these
guys who not necessarily or

281
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,670
thirteen-year-old idiot savant prodigy

282
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:31,699
Nana we're looking for guys who for the
last ten years they've thought about

283
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:35,300
what is what is the issue with this
particular implementation of the

284
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:35,939
language

285
00:16:35,939 --> 00:16:40,839
on this architecture I know so those are
the people who work very hard to find

286
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:44,910
and the ideas that are very hard but
when these guys come up with a good idea

287
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:48,400
there is a guy for example who was a
really smart guy

288
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,460
who did company called Trusteer which in
my previous company I invested in

289
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:56,410
you know them and they said that they
are very simple premise

290
00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:00,340
we'll will make a plugin for browsers
that makes it impossible to

291
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:03,470
either save the data or to print it or
for some

292
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:07,690
or from some external process to access
and you know what they did

293
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:11,540
and it worked and they ended up being
purchased by IBM for a large amount of

294
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,040
money

295
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,690
because no one else could figure that
out so what we're looking for is that

296
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:16,880
kinda whimsey

297
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,650
something that's interesting from guys
who are not your average guy

298
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:24,230
I

299
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:29,190
so actually I'd like to tell you a how
he's good actually

300
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:33,030
bind it stocked up and Katie Did to buy

301
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:38,390
damn a kicker so are perfect yes because
a as you see Cisco he is that it is

302
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,180
quite a lot of company and a a lot of
companions

303
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,390
security insecurity ATL anyone in
Russian

304
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:49,260
are but here some and that the main cut
the first of all

305
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,890
we r lookin to me you and

306
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:58,980
fancy technology which can be im not it
don't do it in security portfolio or

307
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:03,450
that very important points about the
full I would say mantle completely BTK

308
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:07,460
because it's not only important to buy
Kompany by this old important to

309
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,360
integrate the fox hole that company and
technology

310
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:15,120
insight exist in compagnia the next 10
appointed first what

311
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,220
one is engineering talent so poor that
can't be it

312
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,610
a que under development you can order
can be fence about

313
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:26,110
No Deal bought it but if they have a
talent that engineering team

314
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:29,620
dance he's cookin by that company and
binded company

315
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:33,070
issue price me of course of course and
there are

316
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,350
and by and accomplish his goals up with
a lookup intention to

317
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:40,910
QuantiTect obligations to make sure that
the q4 from that company

318
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:43,980
we'll not leave see score I'm

319
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,180
deal at least 20 years for bean

320
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,950
able to transfer your you know to
integrate engineered in theme

321
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:54,510
into fully attached to the development
process and %uh i

322
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,750
intellectual properties so though so

323
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:02,090
so that's a this actually mind that data
for by and saw

324
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:06,269
beauty good engineer didn't seem mental
complete CBDT

325
00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:10,179
and the with the ability to integrate
into existing okay with the security

326
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:11,299
portfolio and

327
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:14,409
opera which indefinitely detain and a
team

328
00:19:14,409 --> 00:19:17,730
because otherwise by and has not know
where you for the company

they're looking for

331
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:28,740
is one ready to say I'm ready to sell

you must much to do up

359
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:27,779
persons with both the much move bushel
will complain is in my view sorry for

360
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:29,950
real impression in discussions so

361
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:33,450
lanson issues please in on

362
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:37,279
again and first of all we have for

363
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:41,379
rock deliberation visa issued and

364
00:21:41,379 --> 00:21:45,529
Russian Academy of Science so basically
you visit told the Institute

365
00:21:45,529 --> 00:21:49,999
& Toubro explain what activities what
kind of activities what kind of help

366
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:50,659
what cal

367
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:54,470
support we can provide for them but EP
talking from

368
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:58,549
I your point of view that you have to
acknowledge and basically waiting is

369
00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:00,399
that we are calm to UNC's it

370
00:22:00,399 --> 00:22:04,399
ok is this technology is great you know
so let's start to develop

371
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:07,490
it it could work but basically it's the

372
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:12,909
Mets the its for our human resources are
limited so basically be

373
00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:15,919
would wades up to you stop to cooperate
with us

374
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,559
okay so I will continue questions so
since we need to speak about

375
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,009
how many people a hoe many guys your
have the company's

376
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:28,009
just few companies

377
00:22:28,009 --> 00:22:31,980
alone whose Britain who would like to
bring companies

378
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,059
global markets okay so

379
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:40,119
depression since it is our main topic my
question to jeff into your actually

380
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:41,350
what's the difficulties

381
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:44,909
and was actually trick to bring company
from

382
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:49,149
tiny if the logical markets since they
consider russia still tiny

383
00:22:49,149 --> 00:22:52,769
the logical markets just 35 percent from
global market

384
00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:56,080
and Israeli market also very small

385
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,840
so Mahal to what's the trick and
difficulties to bring companies

386
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,169
the local market to global especially in
security re

387
00:23:04,169 --> 00:23:07,169
so I I think you guys with

388
00:23:07,169 --> 00:23:11,529
respect you guys need to to say we have
smart guys

389
00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:16,090
we can do engineering and we will do
fine job we have no question that

390
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:20,809
but you you need to say I cannot grow
this company here

391
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:23,780
for many reasons is just difficult and

392
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:27,210
that is much easier we have a phrase
internal to our company

393
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:30,330
where we say it is much easier to hire a
VP of Marketing

394
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:33,650
in Santa Clara the news to hire VP of
Marketing

395
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:38,400
here and the reason is very simple
there's a gigantic pool of talent

396
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,400
in Silicon Valley for all the functions
the you

397
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,530
that you can't do the things that you do
engineering

398
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:48,090
designing new algorithms making new
system fantastic

399
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:51,980
but do want to hire a guy who can be
global VP of Marketing for billion

400
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,730
dollar company

401
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:56,170
is not here is there unfortunately it is
a fact of life

402
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:59,890
and so the the way to grow these
companies

403
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:03,470
is to say we will do I'll our expertise

404
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:07,360
here and then say one critical phrase

405
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,690
I know what I do not know that is what
we we look for guys who say

406
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:16,059
I know what I do not know and it is not
that you're

407
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:20,020
stupid you don't know something it's
that I need a VP of Marketing

408
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:23,070
that's what you go to the c4 go help me
find that guy

409
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:26,530
because the growth is going to come from
hiring world-class team

410
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:31,030
guys or all things that are not
marketing sales

411
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:34,540
support all those guys you need them to
be world class also

412
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,600
absolutely agree and

413
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,130
from stew comments about that question
for civil

414
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:43,360
know we come from Israel

415
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,649
so we invest in the is really related
technology but not just

416
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:51,009
so when the bar because that it was
actually a Swedish company that we

417
00:24:51,009 --> 00:24:52,370
invested in the city drowned

418
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:55,730
a Swedish company that we took
nationally

419
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:59,830
migrated most of the company's
management to the US

420
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:03,960
okay and that's also another critical
element to keep Engineering Corps the

421
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,059
engineering is bass

422
00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:08,759
okay but you make sure that the business
management is word

423
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:12,380
the market these okay and that just to
our much I am unser

424
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,519
on jeff's point but up so in Israel you
know where small market were eight

425
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:17,379
million people

426
00:25:17,379 --> 00:25:20,500
and unfortunately we also don't have
original market that we can

427
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,009
cater for because the geopolitical
situation obviously

428
00:25:24,009 --> 00:25:27,429
a so we need to think global from day
one whenever

429
00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:31,070
even when we do see the investments okay
I'll

430
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:36,960
we up always try to even before we
invest identify the go to market partner

431
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,769
identified advisors a letter

432
00:25:38,769 --> 00:25:42,289
the consultants that can join the
company it may be later on conjoined

433
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:43,059
full-time

434
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:46,480
as a full-time position was the company
starts to ramp up in a release its

435
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,990
its better product so it's critical that
you do that as

436
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:54,159
early as possible don't sit in your lap
for 12-18 months

437
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,409
thinking that you building the the best
product around only to find out

438
00:25:58,409 --> 00:26:01,490
12 or 18 months later that the market
has changed okay

439
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:05,029
com continuously engage with the market
so

440
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:08,879
that that's one common that comment I
want to say the other comment is that

441
00:26:08,879 --> 00:26:13,710
me if you look historically on
specifically in cybersecurity

442
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:17,529
van Joker fees like Israel like Russia

443
00:26:17,529 --> 00:26:21,080
were very difficult to create I

444
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,500
category leaders in cybersecurity resent
being

445
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,690
that the market the buyers okay

446
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:30,850
Western Europe North America especially

447
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:33,970
were hesitant to engage with from

448
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:37,649
for obvious reasons to engage with
israeli all-russian

449
00:26:37,649 --> 00:26:42,000
companies okay now fortunately for all
of us

450
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,500
the US is done a remarkable job okay

451
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:50,649
in changing that okay so the NSA and
other such like organizations have done

452
00:26:50,649 --> 00:26:51,980
a remarkable job

453
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,399
in actually opening up

454
00:26:55,399 --> 00:26:58,719
I additional markets for israeli

455
00:26:58,719 --> 00:27:02,259
and for Russian technologies and I think
that

456
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:06,679
if you look up if you look back I
sinister slowed in civil

457
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:10,629
as its northern revealed sorts of that
but then it's a date did a remarkable

458
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,129
job

459
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:14,489
independently of stardom ISO

460
00:27:14,489 --> 00:27:18,539
so I think from that respect I'll
there's a lot of potential

461
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:21,729
okay to actually create today excellent

462
00:27:21,729 --> 00:27:25,389
world category leaders that have been
generating

463
00:27:25,389 --> 00:27:28,909
or the initial product that the actual
come from rush hour from Israel

464
00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:32,879
okay serving markets the before

465
00:27:32,879 --> 00:27:36,979
were not accessible for such companies
so let me add to that

466
00:27:36,979 --> 00:27:40,679
you the fun

467
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:44,919
the function love intelligence agencies
can sometimes be turned to your

468
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:45,639
advantage

469
00:27:45,639 --> 00:27:49,429
which is to use them to say you're okay
so do you know

470
00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:52,989
the what the largest the largest user of

471
00:27:52,989 --> 00:27:56,029
backup programs from Russian backup
company is

472
00:27:56,029 --> 00:28:00,239
pentagon you know that the largest
backup

473
00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:03,940
I timidly the largest usage are data
leakage protection

474
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:08,179
from the military in the US is from
Russian company

475
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:11,190
because they went there very smart

476
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,940
before they try to sell they said plea
certify us

477
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,950
okay so the guys went out and certified
them

478
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:22,409
and then any government bureaucrats
those minus a says it's okay if it's not

479
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,109
okay they can blame them not me

480
00:28:24,109 --> 00:28:29,389
okay fine done so the key is get some
other bureaucrat to put a stamp on so

481
00:28:29,389 --> 00:28:30,929
that you don't have to certify

482
00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:35,299
so the same thing applies to privacy we
many companies that are concerned about

483
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:39,940
privacy when people say our Russian
company privacy oh my god so what we do

484
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,529
is we say go to Germany

485
00:28:41,529 --> 00:28:44,820
make sure that you meet German
regulations for privacy

486
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:48,719
and what the Germans take the fall for
the privacy not you right

487
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:52,479
said it works we have a company that all
we look at we did not do

488
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:55,999
they keep track of Android variations
thats all they do

489
00:28:55,999 --> 00:29:00,339
Android variation by mobile platform by
carrier by network do you know how many

490
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:01,580
combinations that is

491
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:05,249
its near avocados number big number so

492
00:29:05,249 --> 00:29:08,329
but what they did is they want to
germans first and they said can you

493
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:08,900
certify

494
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,340
has been meeting you privacy of course
okay

495
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,770
now they have no problem yeah lebed

496
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:18,860
give you a very I hypothetical story

497
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:23,770
okay so you know Dennis snowden incident
okay he was a first-party

498
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:27,140
system administrator or contractor

499
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,240
I that was given privileges occur

500
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,930
because the he cleared all the checkups
and whatever the tests okay but no one

501
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,170
really more toward what he does

502
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:39,910
okay and when it dumped up you know
significant amount of data

503
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:44,080
okay up he was okay is he was on the
ridge privileges it didn't

504
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,440
violet Anne me know cybersecurity policy
rule whatever that was in place at

505
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,070
Tennessee

506
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:53,420
so before that happen to know we

507
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:56,780
a hypothetically one of our company's I

508
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:00,860
cyber Ark about what has a solution for
that ok where the solution to identify

509
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:03,620
anomaly in their misuse of privileged
accounts

510
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:07,190
okay I and so that the

511
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:10,780
the US the various US agencies I'll

512
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:14,570
you don't find it very hard to out rely

513
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:17,790
on such a technology coming from israel
I

514
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:20,840
and I can tell you that I

515
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,010
today solve these entities

516
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:29,540
are a definitely one of the largest

517
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:34,580
customers of us are barks technology so
that's a %uh interesting

518
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:38,180
change that is actually happening in the
market love

519
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:41,960
today so but actually do well

520
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,040
spot was someone from you Rachel from

521
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:50,970
the tolls that it is not easy to move
security companies from Israel to states

522
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:56,170
since nobody trusts too much what so
many people trust too much to his

523
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:57,910
release as well as for russians

524
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:02,910
so some security companies so as they
told me about Rick to buy a shell

525
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:03,770
company

526
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:08,960
in how it is walking a lot tells all

527
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,779
all those tricks ok I don't work anchors
so

528
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:16,009
I just a waste of time and money in some
are you know

529
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:20,330
financial supposedly wizards that are
trying to sell you their goods and/or

530
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:22,730
services and so forth so we we don't

531
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:26,320
you know you're an Israeli company or
Russian company

532
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,309
should be proud of that you know we have
the best technology or category

533
00:31:30,309 --> 00:31:34,669
find the right people in the US okay to
help you market it to help you sell it

534
00:31:34,669 --> 00:31:36,200
to help you with the business
development

535
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,999
find the right partner so we actually

536
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:44,460
put a lot of emphasis on finding the
right go to market bought us for supper

537
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:44,990
issue

538
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:48,320
in most of our cyber security company we
have a strategic partner

539
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,600
from the market that is I either

540
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,299
you know a value-added reseller
sometimes they're also a call Investor

541
00:31:55,299 --> 00:31:58,369
so for example over the last the

542
00:31:58,369 --> 00:32:01,869
you're so I did confess mince with the
likes of a I

543
00:32:01,869 --> 00:32:04,929
General Electric for critical
infrastructure cements

544
00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:08,470
I in till EMC

545
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:11,749
and variety of other a companies

546
00:32:11,749 --> 00:32:15,450
I you know in of fun too we have I

547
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:19,869
LP is that come from the market so for
example Cisco is helping our fund

548
00:32:19,869 --> 00:32:22,960
I well in the world of 12 yeah

549
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,210
I'll Alibaba I'll which is

550
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:29,279
you know doesn't need any introduction
is also an LP

551
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,379
in our fun you know coming from a
completely different category but they

552
00:32:32,379 --> 00:32:32,990
also have

553
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:36,450
tremendous cyber security fraud and

554
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:39,600
and such related on needs so we

555
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:45,369
we know that that's all those financial
trickery and he knows shell companies

556
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:47,419
and parent and subsidiary and

557
00:32:47,419 --> 00:32:50,470
you know be the I companies in all of
that

558
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,609
that doesn't work okay I

559
00:32:52,609 --> 00:32:57,200
but what does work is to get the right
to our partners on board

560
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,999
you know there are certain government
contracts which are awarded

561
00:33:01,999 --> 00:33:05,039
two entities that are domiciled in
certain a

562
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,889
but but that's not trigger you can
establish a subsidiary wholly owned

563
00:33:08,889 --> 00:33:10,969
subsidiary and you not concealing it

564
00:33:10,969 --> 00:33:14,889
just two you know check the box in terms
of the contract so whatever a

565
00:33:14,889 --> 00:33:15,989
procurement process

566
00:33:15,989 --> 00:33:19,289
but but I've dad one thing to agree what
you

567
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:23,820
what my a.m. not advice cuz I just see
some other stuff happening

568
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:27,419
I'm EMC and IBM never

569
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:31,289
not once ever have purchased the company
that they have not been a partner with

570
00:33:31,289 --> 00:33:34,919
never not once because they want to sell
byproduct

571
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:38,269
see how it works to their customers once
it's proven

572
00:33:38,269 --> 00:33:41,519
now it's no brain to be able to buy the
company

573
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,869
at Cisco's not exactly the same but I I
will let you speak

574
00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:48,279
about that but but so what you guys to
emphasize

575
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:51,499
what you guys should do is find a
partner

576
00:33:51,499 --> 00:33:54,589
and let that partner break down barriers
for you

577
00:33:54,589 --> 00:33:58,509
you were as a little companies too hard
to break down barriers

578
00:33:58,509 --> 00:34:03,009
but when Cisco re MC or Intel comes to
accompany answers a look

579
00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:07,469
these guys are fine we have fewer 5,000
support engineers will take care of it

580
00:34:07,469 --> 00:34:11,359
but also their certified that we use
them internally is the biggest argument

581
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,159
we use them across our company

582
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:16,770
that people say okay I don't care where
it comes from maybe

583
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:18,419
Michael

584
00:34:18,419 --> 00:34:22,730
so I'd like that a couple of course
about his combined company thought in

585
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:23,340
demo stuff

586
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:26,960
now a lot of companies with his co
bought what

587
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,390
initial in the assessment from see score
by

588
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:34,429
all day at the office who didn't venture
funds bot

589
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:37,750
who were in the most of cases at the
comp when you wear

590
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:41,740
where not our technology Co Park North
so it was just you know like

591
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:45,990
point of investment and in other
interesting story when his quiz by and

592
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,179
one of the compania

593
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:50,890
against his good can be into all in all
you with her over the politics of that

594
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:51,460
company

595
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:55,530
or not but after buying and adopted
their product line

596
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:59,790
see school be came to you with your over
that product

597
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:03,330
so all deposits which are trying to sell
some kind you know

598
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:06,570
ext into a million people who when and
the

599
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:10,890
are they are on the development although
waste on their

600
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:15,130
responders from our internal I A T and
security folks

601
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:19,080
but the again we are by an or call
hewlett Neish

602
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:23,880
Kompany's with great you can all at this
visa pour weepy this in the basement

603
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,740
but the dunno you did not buy yes not to
call the patents

604
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:30,790
okay so any questions

605
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:36,670
again but questions please so while his
questionable

606
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:40,030
no questions okay so

607
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:43,900
I need to you commission looking a
question for you guys

608
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:47,720
so we spent a lot of time trying to find
what we think are

609
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,140
not we don't look at threats we look at

610
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:54,700
club categories risk which is what
companies look at

611
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:58,750
when I talk to the guy who was the chief
security officer for pay pal

612
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:02,890
he does not look at risks is a very
smart guy named Eric Martin

613
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:06,200
and he would look set category of it
risk

614
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,440
so he says you know what the biggest
category we have

615
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,570
is the back in payments the transaction
systems that's what I need to focus on

616
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:17,550
he doesn't read the CV he doesn't do
that he will focus is on

617
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,420
categorization and then reduction risk
so

618
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,480
let me ask you guys which is rather than

619
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,690
a purely technical solution

620
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:30,839
how do you guys do you have any ideas or
companies were you could go

621
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:35,220
and so you know what I dress a category
of problems I don't address one thing

622
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:38,640
I don't address buffer overflows area I
address the fact that

623
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,170
you are unable to connect your external
employees to the internal network

624
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:42,980
without

625
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:47,060
making the internal network open remote
access

626
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:50,400
I do a whole category %uh risk do you
guys think

627
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,190
in categories do you think in broad
strokes as opposed to

628
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:59,290
small and it is not critical is a
question what what what do you think is

629
00:36:59,290 --> 00:36:59,619
the

630
00:36:59,619 --> 00:37:04,050
the focus here small or is anyone in

631
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:07,170
ready to answer is not a test

632
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:10,869
is not like in school or they say no it
is not a test but you get the

633
00:37:10,869 --> 00:37:22,220
nice that's okay okay

634
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:25,660
thank my name is Devin and prolong
company what we do we

635
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,800
year protect applications we expect
attacks

636
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,350
sorry based in moscow or but we r up as
well can

637
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,670
on the global scale from the day one so
it was our strategy

638
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:39,030
no rush inside even yet I

639
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:43,460
of course we don't think only in terms
of threats no

640
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:48,490
E it is very it is not a good thing when
you come to the customer save

641
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:52,170
case have the back side you have some
applications that are you know

642
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:56,340
publicly available on the network
perimeter so you need to protect it

643
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,700
and this is obvious to everyone so this
is not

644
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,820
been we I try to sell them so but

645
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:06,260
we try to you analyze their East's in
terms of

646
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,830
what can happen in terms of these
company from this category of the

647
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:10,430
company's

648
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:13,500
if there will be a data breach there
will be some

649
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,440
area you know and also beauty's inside
their it infrastructure.

650
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,750
so we try to you in the to think what
can be there

651
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:25,530
the impact right if they're

652
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:29,810
replications some weapons for sexual
behind and these keys we try to you

653
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:33,760
show are a Leo yeah and after their
after that we

654
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,510
we and out try to compare it and try to
understand what solutions

655
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:42,190
now company as what previous background
was

656
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:46,490
you know week we hear is akin to keep
secret consulting first down year or

657
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:50,030
sound yes yes oh we know how to crack
»applications yeah

658
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:53,130
and weeks right and to help a lot of
companies you know

659
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:57,350
a really a class companies in Russia to
you improve their security here

660
00:38:57,350 --> 00:39:01,470
and to you not to help them to be Liz
process because

661
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:04,690
we believe that everything about
securities process you there is no

662
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:05,440
process

663
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,420
there will be no security a you can by a
lot of product these product this

664
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,520
product this product but

665
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,500
if they are not connected to each other
if these products and a connected to the

666
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,960
people who work in this company

667
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,620
there will be no security and there will
be day to racial something like

668
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,370
something else

669
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:22,660
anywhere so we tried a lot of products
we tweet right

670
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,810
a lot of reno approaches to you
improving companies

671
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:30,010
and weeee now try to you sell our
products

672
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:33,770
in comparison to the problems they have
with the different approaches

673
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:37,560
and the if this works this works on
right now reworking

674
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:41,650
unit a class in fact companies here in
the enterprise is

675
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:44,920
and we care for our several violence in
tonight it stays

676
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,670
we don't have sales there in human
and/or marketing team but who have

677
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:53,380
pilots because we can let me give you a
comment which is

678
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:58,220
I'm do you know I saw for companies work
because you write the code once and you

679
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,740
saw a hundred thousand copies

680
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:03,440
and that it's called leverage I we also
from our

681
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,980
my discussion yesterday with with defeat
about cryptography

682
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:11,240
10 things he taught me along many many
many years ago this is a white here

683
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:15,880
I'm from decades ago was cryptography is
a process for amplification

684
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,980
were very small piece of data can affect
a very large amount of data

685
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:25,060
so what we're looking for and I'm not
critical what we're looking for is

686
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:28,570
rather than consulting we're looking for
you guys to make

687
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:32,800
out of what you're doing a product where
it is automated so that you get the

688
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,540
leverage so instead of having

689
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:38,980
to need a thousand guys for 1000
companies two guys can produce the

690
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,750
software

691
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:43,970
that affect 10,000 companies because
then the margin is eighty percent

692
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:48,590
versus 15 percent yeah I I totally agree
out just

693
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:52,410
at the one data point here so you know

694
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:55,930
percent we see about 300 companies

695
00:40:55,930 --> 00:41:00,450
we saw about 300 companies in cyber over
the last yr 24 months and we keep

696
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:01,510
statistics

697
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:05,320
it's too were enterpreneurs come from
what their background

698
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:10,970
and obviously we have your usual
suspects hackers and so forth that found

699
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:13,030
their own companies and that's great and
to know

700
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:16,140
israel has many of these essential
russia has as well

701
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:20,780
I and a but what gets us excited really

702
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:24,500
are enterpreneurs that come from our

703
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:28,970
cyber security service provider backdrop
Kosovo have been dealing in the space

704
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:29,570
for

705
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:33,210
56 10 years okay very know their
customers

706
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:37,450
intimately ok with another category
intimately Vigneault exactly

707
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:42,200
what are the problems their customers
are facing infect results of that and by

708
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,430
providing professional services

709
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:47,339
this is too as you do are I to those
customers but now

710
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:50,450
what they're trying to do is for product
eyes their knowledge

711
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:54,970
agrees to actually come and crew put all
that info all that knowledge or not know

712
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:55,440
how

713
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,150
into a product that these are the
companies that are the most interesting

714
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:02,240
for us when we encounter such a are

715
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,700
Jeff talked earlier about in order the
team being the most important technology

716
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,130
back on and so forth but

717
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:11,150
a another am aspect of a good team

718
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:14,690
is the fact that they know not just a
solution to mind but also the problem

719
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:15,319
domain

720
00:42:15,319 --> 00:42:20,660
Arbor intimately and can really also in
that respect be very capital efficient

721
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:24,980
in the side Inc what is the roadmap for
the product what is the go to market you

722
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:25,470
know which

723
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:28,880
geographies that dress first which
categories that dress first

724
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,359
know that's very important as well I and
is that these are the companies that are

725
00:42:32,359 --> 00:42:33,540
most interesting to us

726
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:37,210
I

727
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:41,119
in in our practice we have about three
chic on its startup scene a

728
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,220
it. in school choir and forty of them in
this I cybersecurity

729
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:48,410
and basically what we see that most of
startups they start

730
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:51,829
are its own business from consulting
part of you

731
00:42:51,829 --> 00:42:55,049
so basically they have great experience
and they start

732
00:42:55,049 --> 00:42:59,589
provides consulting service and for one
point they decided to make the product

733
00:42:59,589 --> 00:43:03,619
and basically change company a lot so
basically change a lot of business

734
00:43:03,619 --> 00:43:04,329
processes

735
00:43:04,329 --> 00:43:07,849
change a lot of stuff people and skills
they need

736
00:43:07,849 --> 00:43:12,030
to I make a change from consulting
business

737
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:15,589
to basically product business and

738
00:43:15,589 --> 00:43:18,670
dime from and whens this company

739
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:23,599
years them Paz's this spirit
successfully

740
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:27,160
they start to provide great really great
results

741
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,170
from those that point for us. adjuster

742
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:33,640
move critical point for any startup and

743
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:38,559
else believes that and that Missy lot of
companies a start

744
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:41,670
going abroad and most of them say

745
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:45,680
the basic way just to find right partner
right people may be some rumor some

746
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,020
small small but some but a new
innovating eat local

747
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,260
school usually

748
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:53,830
and frontal its just crucial step

749
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:57,770
we have some companies a half

750
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:01,010
I am international client but the yeah

751
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:05,550
have a legal entity in Russia only but
basically this company's

752
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:08,980
has a very specific product for very
small market

753
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:12,350
my babies maybe market one since

754
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:17,100
climate million dollars but it basically
it's very few clients it's very small

755
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:21,440
my very targets market you for company
decided to

756
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,840
to sell more market for my product for
broad market is

757
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:29,110
basically the the company mars meet
apartment

758
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:33,410
or represent to Forbes an adjustment

759
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:37,910
at how we target different companies so
I present Europe is Ken

760
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:41,040
sacks and I what we do do

761
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,300
software for to secure business
applications

762
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:48,010
like SAP and Oracle mission-critical
business applications

763
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:51,900
and so we will we do we have represents
have seen

764
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:56,110
straily company again Amsterdam

765
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:59,920
and it'll be the US and still changing
so

766
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:05,369
we do are we have we know that there are
risks like

767
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:09,289
for example is by Nash sabotage in
France for companies

768
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:12,569
in general then looking for industries
like

769
00:45:12,569 --> 00:45:15,779
have on guess are in oil and gas

770
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:19,559
companies to use those types of business
applications

771
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:24,569
to manage operations cyber on chick
supply chain or something else

772
00:45:24,569 --> 00:45:27,650
for those steps of operations beating
them what

773
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:31,559
other reasons for those types of
operations and would do the same for

774
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:34,390
different industries and for their
products that they use

775
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:37,809
and with dark there and telling them
what a specific risks

776
00:45:37,809 --> 00:45:54,050
for their industries for their products

777
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:57,350
about region side

778
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:00,650
us yesterday so talk about

779
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:04,170
focusing not on stress just looks
problems

780
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:07,540
on his problem so when addition to your
sample

781
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:11,400
of belt transaction processing hi

782
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,600
every them company

783
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,080
care about money safety my

784
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,540
at even this company will

785
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:22,700
think like arcane let me think about

786
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:26,050
to Miyazaki use ken process it

787
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:29,390
so you should care about a lot of things

788
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:33,250
safety speedo or some that the sources
from where you can

789
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:36,290
get some information about maybe

790
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:40,480
a loyalty and reality of

791
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,580
transaction source land about

792
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:47,710
problem this transaction so the main
problem is too

793
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:50,480
me detect some i right

794
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,000
their actions of I

795
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
choose in that development tooth and
right

796
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,589
may be a way to

797
00:46:59,589 --> 00:47:03,609
develop some maybe global and

798
00:47:03,609 --> 00:47:07,280
the and right system to

799
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:12,049
to improve all

800
00:47:12,049 --> 00:47:15,109
aspects of the problem salt thats

801
00:47:15,109 --> 00:47:18,710
so we have all the

802
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:22,460
minutes and we started from nightmare
and we'll finish was late

803
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:26,289
sold so idea is about

804
00:47:26,289 --> 00:47:30,150
assume possibly most of us will agree to

805
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:33,470
cheapens you sis will take a bold

806
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:37,079
else about something so

807
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:40,510
and fault will change completely so
what's the

808
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:43,760
nightmare we expect to get in 35 10
years

809
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,069
from security and privacy point to you
this is this guy's

810
00:47:48,069 --> 00:47:53,140
moon I Utes IIT everywhere so it means
that we will be

811
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:56,549
all linked to threats so

812
00:47:56,549 --> 00:48:00,280
so as a

813
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:05,420
as with the said yesterday balances the
need to the state versus

814
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:09,720
the needs of the individual for privacy
in such are going to be severely tested

815
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:13,220
and we have a company that

816
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:18,029
make streetlights and each street light
has a single board Linux computer and 30

817
00:48:18,029 --> 00:48:19,289
sensors on board

818
00:48:19,289 --> 00:48:22,460
each like so we have

819
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:26,500
decided very consciously not to send we
would bring all the data back to the

820
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,869
club and people right analytic aP's

821
00:48:28,869 --> 00:48:32,230
so we've decided to a non allies and
single-blind

822
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:37,329
the data to keep the personal
information secret but not everyone does

823
00:48:37,329 --> 00:48:37,890
this

824
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:41,079
and so for example one of the
applications that someone wrote against

825
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:43,309
our data cloud for this company is

826
00:48:43,309 --> 00:48:46,789
from the moment you step out of your car
in the shopping mall

827
00:48:46,789 --> 00:48:50,589
we track your footsteps and we watch
which store you go into

828
00:48:50,589 --> 00:48:55,140
and we know then that if that store has
a sale or nah do you probably want in

829
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,450
that store for that reason

830
00:48:56,450 --> 00:49:00,460
therefore we sell that information to
the store has an anti Amazon defense

831
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:03,910
that's today so if you think five years
out

832
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:08,660
and you think that we can do time-based
correlation across various data sources

833
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:10,910
we can get a lot of information which

834
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:15,190
you can't hide it is impossible to hide
and that is very worrisome

835
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:18,410
because you can fill all kinds have been
for or conserve analytics

836
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:25,020
that essentially make the society
compressed a alarm

837
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:29,720
never forget worried about those chips
but will it be embedded under our skin

838
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,170
Zam actually I

839
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:34,890
I think we have a more of shorter-term
things to worry about

840
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:39,820
I'll give it to to offer the things that
we are very concerned with and

841
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:45,130
I think that I'll their solvable from a
technology perspective

842
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:48,800
heart but solvable but I think that the
market economics

843
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,000
will make it almost impossible to
actually so for that target the two

844
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,670
examples

845
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:56,400
are the first one is the a critical
infrastructure

846
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,619
in particular energy production facility

847
00:49:59,619 --> 00:50:04,360
and where as I mentioned working very
closely with

848
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:07,830
for solve the leading companies in the
space and

849
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:12,210
I certain technologies exist to help
improve the situation dramatically

850
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:15,790
but I think that market dynamics

851
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:19,020
from I cannot economic of a national
perspective are just

852
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:22,910
such that will not allow those
technologies structure which

853
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:26,619
a wide scale implementation over the
next few years and that's a major

854
00:50:26,619 --> 00:50:30,750
issue in my opinion that's one thing
second think which also suffers from

855
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:31,700
market

856
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:36,380
I would say dynamics that will impair
deputy to come up with the right

857
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:37,210
solutions

858
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:40,990
I is in the automotive sector and I
think that

859
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:47,690
again relatively simple technologies in
ok on bus kinda fun farm and sand

860
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:51,790
you know the problems are not overly
complex compared to other

861
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:52,539
I

862
00:50:52,539 --> 00:50:55,589
I A you know computing environment

863
00:50:55,589 --> 00:50:59,569
I'll but just the dynamics all and the
supply chain

864
00:50:59,569 --> 00:51:03,009
offered automotive industry is going to
make it very hard to arm

865
00:51:03,009 --> 00:51:08,640
have well widespread I implementation of
such technologies over the next few

866
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,419
years and

867
00:51:09,419 --> 00:51:14,229
most of the cars sold today are very
vulnerable to attacks

868
00:51:14,229 --> 00:51:17,999
I love so I think that these are two of
the

869
00:51:17,999 --> 00:51:21,579
threats that my pin and even before we
get to

870
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:25,219
those privacy related chips under your
skin kinda think

871
00:51:25,219 --> 00:51:30,119
I know keeps us awake at night in

872
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:34,209
I but is that purposeful as a society

873
00:51:34,209 --> 00:51:38,150
will be really compressed seasonals
price it seems but basically a

874
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:41,459
all the information we have for

875
00:51:41,459 --> 00:51:44,880
VP usual things that this information
will likely be public

876
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,219
began it doesn't matter the all you this

877
00:51:48,219 --> 00:51:51,289
information about hellz about anything
it can be

878
00:51:51,289 --> 00:51:55,299
it can the leakage can help in San
anytime so basically I believe that it

879
00:51:55,299 --> 00:51:57,890
will be a kind of change in the mind of
people to

880
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:00,979
that liked finally fine

881
00:52:00,979 --> 00:52:04,169
be we'll have to accept it basically

882
00:52:04,169 --> 00:52:08,640
was no no way to to height from
technology in a way to

883
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:12,349
Heidi on behaving in a way to height
platelets

884
00:52:12,349 --> 00:52:15,509
in to be to be sure that your

885
00:52:15,509 --> 00:52:18,630
hi Davidson it's unlikely that this
mission

886
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:24,790
really example sometime

887
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:26,780
actually to despite that will be a wife

888
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:29,920
yeah Hannah thought to respond to the
question so

889
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,390
video shot could use for all for you
folks

890
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:36,530
whole release by an assassin on internet
shops

891
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:39,890
is raise your hands everybody

892
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:45,350
are who is a that moment is really taken
care about you but I was and how your

893
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:46,770
data will be used

894
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:51,570
raise your hand again ok a couple for
actually

895
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:56,170
so significantly on it less fault in to
be on the security confidence

896
00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:59,780
dock into security ford's saw a year
fault

897
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:04,550
i thinkin about easier over do any and
all I could ever love him play could be

898
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:05,380
his nurse

899
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:09,980
short be in card to live in their
vacation see Tim et cetera

900
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:13,740
so they generators such a said great
amount of our

901
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:17,450
data so big data analytics really hot
topic today

902
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:21,870
but they are they don't really care
about de Paiva here

903
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:25,640
so that's why I thought I'm definitely
very big fun of but I would say

904
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:29,800
but unfortunately big data analytics to
be loopy in

905
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:34,000
and the I that's just reality. him okay
so

906
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,390
are we need to analyze I would like to

907
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:41,590
sent you to the guns group

908
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:46,270
and and addition an additional I would
like Cecil

909
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:50,630
who connected to local WiFi by means a

910
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:54,290
no one okay great so you can keep your
form

911
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:57,310
walk-ins so you don't need to see
through them so

912
00:53:57,310 --> 00:54:01,170
good luck ok actually a back door %uh
saturation

913
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:06,120
are I don't they even take my laptop the
boys it if I can base confidence

914
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:14,039
me too I don't like the only one phone
not connected

915
00:54:14,039 --> 00:54:14,700
okay thank you guys
