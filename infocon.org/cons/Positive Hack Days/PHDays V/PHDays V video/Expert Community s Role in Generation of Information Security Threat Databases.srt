1
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,439
let's begin our roundtable

2
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:11,600
as you can

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,760
all this year stake

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,280
Russia have given a database of for the
abilities and threats

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,570
it took a long time to repair it

6
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,920
de tienda feel content on this database
while

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,910
a roundtable will be dedicated to why we
have created

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,920
right is it useful an opinion up

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,970
experts on this particular question so
best

10
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:41,530
first speaker should not be introduced
the head and saying departments take

11
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:42,110
russia

12
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:46,080
hello dear colleagues

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:53,600
should we see though should be stand up
well

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,589
I have no presentations with me kid
doesn't work

15
00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:09,049
or it doesn't work yes it works yes it
works

16
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:11,960
today I have no presentations but

17
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,610
I'm going to tell you bout well-known
tort pic and mainly

18
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,520
up to you perhaps while getting ready
for this

19
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,990
Eve and today or lurking at the HA and

20
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,720
look to what are we going to speak about
threats

21
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,429
data Bates that was built by

22
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:37,189
federal says of articulate export
control it was developed by

23
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:43,030
article controller said this stack it's
available to everybody it's

24
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:46,060
address his BTU dot apps take

25
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,750
dot more you will and you can

26
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:53,369
enter today a official steckel Russia

27
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:57,459
and there's a site of taking a bishop
information about we have the reference

28
00:01:57,459 --> 00:02:00,250
to it so if you wanna be will be
interest end

29
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:06,240
in the slide you you will be able you
will be able to look at it and ask

30
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,450
questions about the butt

31
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:14,430
right now in a should be enough time
would like to challenge you

32
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,470
about why not has

33
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,030
didn't look within reason to create such
information resource

34
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,269
such a database of threats similar that
is and how it will continue functioning

35
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:27,500
in the future

36
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:33,000
and public develop in the future so

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,430
what was the main wat chief for
developing such a database

38
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:41,780
for a longer period of time

39
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,850
well if you work in the information
security a

40
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,250
city of Olympia left on your remembered
that the

41
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,090
legal requirements of expect dry share

42
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,060
legal requirements over

43
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:01,420
organization were very strict from the
point of view

44
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,540
they were not connected to certain
specific threats and they did not

45
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,850
deep band and those threats because we
tried that

46
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:13,930
there is a certainly stop threats for
which weekend forum

47
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:19,390
the certainly some requirements and this
week while it should be a full fielder

48
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:22,430
and should make information system

49
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,540
to be safe but you know that time
specimen

50
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,200
in the bods 2000 well

51
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,740
in principle we have started seeing

52
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:37,370
a wave of new information technologies
developments

53
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:41,810
addictive it is of law enforcement
agencies and I will speak for my sector

54
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,220
of responsibility

55
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,570
and the main emphasis was to extend

56
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:49,940
and publish lol personal data

57
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:55,959
which has predefined to provide
information security to a wide circle

58
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:00,870
of information systems which up keeps
eyes private data

59
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,220
I mean week our service

60
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:10,239
has changed concept of forming these
requirements and since then

61
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,950
we started defining the terms and
definitions

62
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,510
of our threats to look that'll be
related to information

63
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:23,830
we study defining the ideas that
measures of protection of information

64
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,530
in information systems should be
interconnected with threats to their

65
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,660
security

66
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:33,290
into this kitchen information another
basic models were defined and it wasn't

67
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,490
even a year 2005-2006

68
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,580
a in the year 2007 of course an in
principle

69
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:44,300
until recently days concept of

70
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:49,450
will remain protection ceases defense
systems and realization of defensive

71
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,080
measures

72
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,900
in information systems well this
approach was maintained by us

73
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,130
but nevertheless process of understand
the problem is

74
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,270
is a constant process is a

75
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,970
accommodative process which cause the
developed

76
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,020
so the ski fan switch happening events
like these

77
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,490
you dance like a heaven with although
organizations like the social security

78
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,220
in the autumn

79
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,680
the all communications with you as

80
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,860
experts well it has brought us to a
number of other problems

81
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,880
and we should go lower than threats of

82
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,350
information security about well so
should speak also but not

83
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,250
technical things we should start
speaking about what practical side of

84
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,840
the question to provide informational

85
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,990
security to the company's we should
speak about discovery detection and

86
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,889
removal

87
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:40,699
although their abilities in the software
and Information Systems in general

88
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:44,070
well I'll be honest with you

89
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:47,970
speaking about it one all such

90
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:54,560
engines conductor said this were to
events which are heading in Russia

91
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,639
in the spring and in it ordered because
we I usually

92
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,440
participate in this offense and this
events when they look at the practical

93
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,630
side of these question

94
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,300
of our realization of attacks
discovering of

95
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:14,630
vulnerabilities et cetera et cetera so
such

96
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,909
communication has led us to and it has
convinced us

97
00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:23,710
that in are a legislative requirements
and legislative documents which are

98
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,530
being published by us we should include

99
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,360
questions ask analysis similar
businesses and our discovery so we have

100
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,699
included this question

101
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:34,090
in a GM Danny Pino if you were involved
he

102
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:37,909
in the realization of requirements in
some state public authorities

103
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:41,180
this is murder number seventeen by stick
with Russia

104
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,250
week 1 a protecting the information in
the state information system

105
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,419
they have a direct requirement which
defines

106
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:51,699
and the station creating information
systems stage of the

107
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:56,320
exploitation they should make periodical

108
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,120
%uh already 804 vulnerabilities and take
measures

109
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,750
on their removal next documented that
was developed a

110
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:10,060
with the measures of protection be
automated systems of controlling the

111
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,370
a

112
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,270
important facilities like industrial

113
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:18,530
automated process control systems ABC es
but we also develop the

114
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:22,539
low on the need to discover dealer
abilities and take measures

115
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:26,240
and their removal this scene

116
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,080
Wei Shen was transferred to the station
of certification and protection of

117
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,840
information

118
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,370
and South we're in the process of
certification tests a

119
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:39,479
in the lab that tests

120
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:43,690
a soft one hard when of course the

121
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:47,569
head should do this work in the debt
could be different up those stairs but

122
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:48,270
nevertheless

123
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:52,479
these objective was to find for them so
we started moving

124
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,970
it is direction very seriously so one of
the first questions that we have faced

125
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,110
why should we to

126
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:05,750
information initial information in or
its you will be able to

127
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:10,759
by realize all those laws it was keen
about and I'm speaking a level all this

128
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:12,970
staid by the maturities and integrators

129
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,110
including the issue of and
implementations of measures

130
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:21,840
in a state information systems so when
we have made an attempt

131
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,199
to the loc but well-known

132
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:31,490
international

133
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,599
and American databases of our minerals
lexii

134
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,589
and other ones when we have referred to
them well

135
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:43,360
huh in certain circles so we

136
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,390
have been suggested

137
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:50,540
did hey that these documents have a
certain legal power

138
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:55,180
the sources have been removed from our
house

139
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,010
because in a certain level lawyers

140
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:03,620
and those who will follow this week once
in the state level

141
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:08,490
the staying in different categories

142
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:12,490
so we can with a question of creating in
Russia

143
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:15,880
are only a resource which

144
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,610
could be useful and responsible while
doing

145
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,390
the work I'm discovery r violence and
threats in the south

146
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,750
were an information system and we have
set sucked

147
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,460
such an objective toy sales tool disc
Arbor

148
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:33,760
all the threats and we have a certain
Department involved in this works at

149
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,190
least

150
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:39,490
have started these work well with to
speak but several

151
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,560
aspects of the spoken about the main
purpose of this resource

152
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,270
and where the name came through

153
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,340
because we analyzed lot of different
publications

154
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:56,220
published by the expert community it
published in the Internet in this first

155
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,090
one was

156
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,500
why the Seth red dot at Billys there

157
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,280
why not diabetes or just on their
abilities

158
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,180
it and it's the first question that was
asked by many people but I don't know

159
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,250
whether you know or not Mike question

160
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,180
will to sound more like an official
question to you but

161
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,940
formation of the database of threats to
the security and information we have

162
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,230
special authority for that

163
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:25,270
but well if we are still buddies
authority law enforcement agency we have

164
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,460
to do something that will

165
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,070
authorized to do so we were not able to
call a database of

166
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:35,170
vulnerabilities well eap we will take
definition of Diabetes Center

167
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:38,710
us so much which is defined by

168
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:52,370
national standards today there was no
need to rename it differently

169
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,020
and the second one the purpose Mon

170
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:58,780
where the main purposes

171
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:02,690
this pure ittt is a state

172
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,790
informational systems on board and

173
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,910
key systems of information
infrastructure

174
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,920
but first of all these are industrial
systems sir

175
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,580
a and apcs on the critical facilities

176
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,530
everything why we do this work is
related to these two categories

177
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:25,860
of systems %uh to meet at process
control systems and software

178
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,260
which used inside of these systems

179
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,490
and an annual basis we do laundry two
warring

180
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,940
I love this source is which available to
us in order to define which

181
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,580
are the most common programs which are
used in this class is a systems

182
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:45,140
and then work is being planned for the
year ahead and the bases of the classes

183
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,430
the software which are used in these
systems

184
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:53,230
therefore many have you if you ask
yourself questions so

185
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,350
why don't we have some are other types

186
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:00,550
of software related with banking spero
activities

187
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:03,720
because we didn't have the subjective
from the beginning he began

188
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,230
our main objective was to regularly each

189
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:11,900
Armenia realities well

190
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:16,900
arced to the main purpose of creating it
well as being more detail about that

191
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,970
but first a brawl the on-stage a letter
emphasized too because you should

192
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:26,110
understand that the experience of
forming such a resource in russia we had

193
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,210
no such experience

194
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:34,030
and our colleagues American colleagues
who would eat soup for it and who will

195
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:34,810
provide it

196
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:38,550
functioning of CV for example nobody
will say to you

197
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:42,630
how they do it and how the internal
structures and systems are bail

198
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:46,180
in no companies so we basically speaking
work incorporating

199
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,200
with Russian organizations which
specialize

200
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,950
which do specialize in such operations
we

201
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:56,100
right now trying until the end of the
year

202
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,650
until the end of the year we are trying

203
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,329
to thought to myself

204
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:05,459
word and EF sample or

205
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:09,709
experts tells us that some information
is not really

206
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:14,399
update it because the delay all the
information from being published in

207
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,079
for in other sources is two weeks and
they will tell you why but to three

208
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,339
weeks after the meet first publication

209
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:25,480
well we're trying to keep the stempel
and mechanisms of analyses disk

210
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,279
operating

211
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:30,379
the the through new threats and I think
that

212
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:36,089
equal shrine common direction

213
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:39,920
work with the expert community and with
respective organizations of course

214
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,429
who specialize in this particular work
then we'll achieve

215
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:47,040
the better pregnancy and better quality
operations in these

216
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,299
direction the spear therefore

217
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:53,540
right now so we are on this stage

218
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,369
all file working with organisations
technical questions

219
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:01,889
to analyze to discover to work with
experts to describe those

220
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:02,970
vulnerabilities

221
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:07,040
and threats so although Sir criticisms

222
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,769
that were published it gives us yes some
of those criticisms are

223
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:18,120
really viable but I would like to tell
you to follow a I love the

224
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,750
bills that came to us 19 proposals came
to us

225
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:27,510
to improve the functioning of this
resource and its operation thirty were

226
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,220
considered

227
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:32,290
the years seven remaining I still been
continued to be delayed because the

228
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:36,779
are really costly ones and we need to
attract more financial means and

229
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:42,240
manpower so it works as an information
resource was made objective is to

230
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,880
in forum and provide information and
support to special East's

231
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,550
integrators clients in operators to

232
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,589
work in the area of discovery

233
00:14:53,589 --> 00:14:58,710
and analyzing threats afterwards we do
you assume

234
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:02,070
with dua soon that will introducer

235
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:07,600
the leniency in the regulatory documents
and it will be used in different stages

236
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,000
all organizing and conducting a work
phone pointed

237
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,120
you have creating protected see
something from the point of view of city

238
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,010
occasional tears and situation of
systems protect information

239
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:21,460
now below to see if EU

240
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,910
words that

241
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:28,270
later and says right now that 60 for
threats

242
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:33,330
and more than 10,000 vulnerabilities
spin that wheel in abilities of software

243
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:37,630
little speak about it in more detail
what is a long as you can what is a

244
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,350
principal

245
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,550
of work away at these particular
resource

246
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,700
ass to the security threats they are
being

247
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,880
up delayed and will be continued to
bring updated in the

248
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,790
were only basis so the Pew its of thread
upgrades

249
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,880
because it's a pretty steady
confirmation ask

250
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,700
to vulnerabilities the are included into
these diabetes

251
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,250
ambery week so once a week we have

252
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,940
and updated the system which includes
vulnerabilities

253
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:12,890
that information about which was
published recently and I would like to

254
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:13,570
say that not

255
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,709
all the abilities are hitting these data
base festival

256
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:20,410
it includes the least of the software
that was speedy much and we're

257
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,380
protecting the same objective ease

258
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:26,780
lot just simply taken copied from
someplace or about a place

259
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,300
but we should check whether it's simple
nobility and whether it's available in

260
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,360
certain product that

261
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,640
were responsible for it was not
confirmed by the manufacturer then

262
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,230
scalia

263
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:40,089
so we are trying to not to put

264
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:43,579
oliver their abilities in studies all
the information that

265
00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:46,930
he's been published from different
sources he's been validated

266
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,700
so what %uh sources sources are you

267
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:55,850
when you discuss this from their
abilities when you speak about them

268
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:00,140
and some forums I'm speeding up coming
accessible forums

269
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:04,819
of course these informations always been
reading viewed by us we

270
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:08,730
take it into consideration when we do
all workin loss of course

271
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,520
information that's been published by
various official sources

272
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,990
and I'll never was hiding place have

273
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:20,699
including CE that a BS in all other
sources and in total we have to only 15

274
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:22,370
sources which are being constantly

275
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:25,630
analyzed and on the basis of the sources
we make

276
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:30,720
samples we do our research and then we
make a decision about including on on

277
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,710
including for their abilities into a
resource

278
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:43,230
what else I would like to tell you we

279
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,710
do work not only alone but we

280
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:50,040
involve other organizations in our work
and would like to attract

281
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,990
expert community to work with us on
those are the villages that were

282
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,780
discovered

283
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,740
but you because a right now we do have
one

284
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:04,900
precedent one of the specialists and his
name

285
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,760
is a place in our source one specials
have sent us information about

286
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,169
ability of the vulnerability way trying
to check the solubility we're not

287
00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:14,059
finished his work

288
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:18,179
and if this person issue I will explain
your reason the fact is that rare

289
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:21,200
it's a very expensive for equipment

290
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,309
involved in this vulnerability and if
you are not able to confirm it seemed

291
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:27,090
like that well

292
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:30,260
well as an objective of this work is
that would like to Bri

293
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,660
build cooperation with manufacturers of
this software

294
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,510
so that they should be informed and from
our site while so

295
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:40,669
should ask them to remover

296
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:43,919
such vulnerabilities Eve they are
discovered

297
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,429
us for russian teen Bella bus
manufacturers and first two-goal

298
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:51,669
those companies which certify their
products

299
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:55,140
in are the certification system these

300
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,210
truck tyres is I'll other already
available

301
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:01,240
so

302
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,580
if you've been able to see to russian

303
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:08,620
products in respect to which we have
introduced

304
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:12,770
acceptable it's about them and after
developers have removed us from their

305
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,740
abilities and then published information

306
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,520
bought where the upgrade can be
downloaded from

307
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,600
we have transfer this information we
have included into

308
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,890
open segment of order to be something
about 1c

309
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:32,200
and database winter

310
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,780
so I think we have very good relations
with

311
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:38,580
with you but the main problem which
happens is that

312
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,600
we don't have a constant understanding
especially in the South aggression and

313
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,790
pictures about it in need of solving its
objectives and these processes been

314
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,830
extended intact

315
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:51,410
did absence of human resources due to
the absence of the

316
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:55,160
testing possibilities but I think that
way

317
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,940
I love working with developers but
software developers

318
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,260
very closely and especially missing much
Russian

319
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:05,540
catcher said we will work with them Gary
actively

320
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:09,540
so I think that together with them will
be able to solve the subproblem

321
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:13,540
I'm straight about removal of
vulnerabilities this is Arjun

322
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:17,750
work so your participation us experts a
special lease

323
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:22,030
in this work it's important is important

324
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,580
and we together with you we on grady

325
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:29,429
to work in these direction well I asked
for

326
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:33,750
are orientation wells have tools you in
the evening it was

327
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,000
first the information resource but we're
also working on

328
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,059
other directions to extend its
functionality

329
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:46,490
for practical for practical operations

330
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:50,070
in and our main objective

331
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:55,070
east to deal orientation for it so that
8

332
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:59,570
its specific Acer should be emphasized
and stretching from the other doesn't

333
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:02,950
16 will look at russians softball

334
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:06,510
lot excluding of course our work

335
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:11,890
we on other common products and systems
which are commonly used

336
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:16,730
both in our countries and in the west
but we do think that they

337
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:20,470
value of artwork any specifics he is

338
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:23,970
position at the fair that we should work
according to

339
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:28,059
Russian a soft were information about it

340
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:33,120
is the obese cats foreign sources and
sometimes it's not being available

341
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,430
so

342
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,910
more obviously he will be able to seat
in the effort doesn't 16

343
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:44,970
but we had to start from something so we
have formed

344
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:50,680
the SIR the zero level from which were
started our movement us for

345
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,330
other developments we'll see how will be
able to do that have appealed

346
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:59,150
to achieve results yes of course we have
not achieved

347
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:04,930
certain system which is a distributed by
the houses of

348
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:10,130
liabilities together with our western
the like Microsoft Cisco without

349
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:10,930
question clients

350
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:15,880
well we don't have such a system but we
are striving for it

351
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,380
so we are moving this the wrong
direction with small steps

352
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,400
in I do

353
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:34,850
whole that will be able to complete this
project well

354
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:40,460
let me see among those publications data
must be about maybe I can refer to some

355
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:40,930
of them

356
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:46,299
well

357
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:48,630
we doom work with all

358
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:52,150
incoming information and perhaps you pay
attention to how does a page

359
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:56,080
force feedback and you can also

360
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,679
ability tool provide information

361
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,870
and try Girish information about threats
vulnerabilities in about resource itself

362
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:08,419
we constantly work on it and we do
cooperate with a special lease

363
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:12,549
for have been directing this information
to us so I can tell you

364
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:17,630
once game all the suggestions and
recommendations which are given to us we

365
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,720
do analyze them

366
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,350
all but they're is a number of
difficulties which are related

367
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:26,470
with financing and with are
possibilities to

368
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:32,030
a place efforts 10 subjective is
comparative analyses of threats and

369
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,100
vulnerabilities

370
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:37,549
and the identification in order to have
understanding which are the threats

371
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:41,780
and that which on their ability they do
exploit we'd eat

372
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,039
have to different proposals in his
direction

373
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,210
whether I'd even one last time was still
working direction

374
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,340
because they are certain difficulties

375
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:55,010
like their big number of vulnerabilities

376
00:23:55,010 --> 00:24:00,830
should be. just but perhaps that should
be done

377
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:04,610
we shoot if I'll do it and shielding the
year and

378
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:09,460
possibilities the this work is a joyful
handle him chasing like that

379
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:13,650
and us for methodological provisioning
homeboy

380
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:18,270
have published best with the DOJ's in
our internet site

381
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:22,770
the is starting to uses database of

382
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:26,480
threats that information that the word
on more than

383
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,100
we collect information

384
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:34,190
we collect information from the Internet
publications we will give

385
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:38,630
also efficient information for some
worry you have published a

386
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:39,770
disinformation

387
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:43,090
I will analyze it and we'll take it into
consideration

388
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:48,669
the only thing I would like to hear more
specifics about

389
00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:52,519
how can we fix methodology or carers a

390
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:56,259
and I would like to see certain specific
proposals and more just general

391
00:24:56,259 --> 00:24:57,639
description of the problem

392
00:24:57,639 --> 00:25:01,169
but with Danish were

393
00:25:01,169 --> 00:25:05,950
always small problems and ask for a
moment

394
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:09,789
derivation well wastewater document

395
00:25:09,789 --> 00:25:14,049
its informational resource for infor-
mation

396
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:18,119
and when the model of threats

397
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:21,859
the he's been formed in this information
system

398
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:25,619
it does have the same mall you like a
URL

399
00:25:25,619 --> 00:25:29,210
to miss a little document over a other
can't buy

400
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:33,739
and that's what we're speaking about in
or informational message

401
00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:38,679
those photos in the interval side
possible so I'm reinsurance

402
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:43,100
mission yes well

403
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:47,779
so

404
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:51,080
were in your emotions you

405
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,720
our case there's how do you select the
soft were

406
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:00,109
and the second question

407
00:26:00,109 --> 00:26:04,879
will be mandatory

408
00:26:04,879 --> 00:26:09,470
for getting a certificate security
certificate

409
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:15,210
will it be mandatory to be included in
this list well start with the second

410
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:15,789
question

411
00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:18,960
the least by which we select for the

412
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:25,999
analysis software this is not related to
wait mandatorily associates occasional

413
00:26:25,999 --> 00:26:26,369
these

414
00:26:26,369 --> 00:26:29,559
software so these are to

415
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:34,070
processes which are independent one from
another

416
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:41,080
so it doesn't mean necessarily

417
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,780
a letter said

418
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:46,420
it's not just a simple least that was
approved by somebody somewhere

419
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:49,640
and don't forget about it no its

420
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,410
list of products that we festival all
looking at in specific

421
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:57,410
year has been formed its been formed an
analysis of common resources

422
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:01,160
and why do I mean by that it includes
registries

423
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,630
registry of federal state systems

424
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:08,360
this a different contests open tray

425
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,190
its the show projects with love
information

426
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:17,120
and we've been missing each especially
those projects we should security from

427
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,060
industries

428
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:22,970
so Jesus sources related to some
statistical data

429
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:26,580
overcoming the first publishing seven
years ago on

430
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,200
how many different products in which
induces the do use

431
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,300
so they had a lot of Katy area and their

432
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,760
different priorities to the source

433
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:41,780
but there is no need in

434
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:47,500
well the list of products which are
being clobbered

435
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,880
or have high frequency of utilization

436
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,820
and of course we are working his
direction as well

437
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:58,710
we have a proposal to ask

438
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:02,750
other questions do good looter not look
at later

439
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:06,740
would later you will never be able to
ask those questions so if you have

440
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,510
questions

441
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:11,080
you should I because it's not

442
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,170
often we have a possibility district of
especially

443
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:18,460
steel welded session interesting topic
otherwise

444
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:24,220
will forgive other interesting
presentations will take you away from

445
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:27,400
killer process ask try

446
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:32,130
Tim cases on a possibility to

447
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:35,430
come to you I wasn't expert committee
chair somehow

448
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:40,980
with their request to I Elias

449
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:44,160
unless software which is being done
level abrasion

450
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,240
so we have a number of Information
Systems

451
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,540
wish are done globally to the whole
region

452
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:55,140
and private about me I do have some
questions in the software

453
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,180
so you can help us with this aging

454
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,850
well we are speaking

455
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:07,000
botched eight seasons and regional
levels so we have to look with him

456
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,070
carefully to it and what the sis's with
certification

457
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:13,900
because we shouldn't forget the process
of situation tests

458
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:17,880
Eve these product half past

459
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,440
situation procedure and if he yes

460
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,310
well if your own didn't buy this
situation should he

461
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:28,650
fastest kitchen he was here are the
states mission system

462
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:32,540
them all private should be satisfied

463
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:37,790
those issues sold as make an e-zine and
those which have the measures of

464
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,130
Information Protection

465
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:42,790
this is not my week while this is a
requirement to legislation

466
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:46,580
and other sub loss therefore

467
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:50,380
if handle some other product

468
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:55,550
there and you cairn you can give us

469
00:29:55,550 --> 00:30:00,410
or force to a field and I cannot
guarantee you that today

470
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:06,970
right hand to wall with you it'll also
love

471
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:14,610
efforts for questions changes or

472
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:18,630
so every vulnerability is being checked
by you in your lap

473
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:24,610
yes yes yes suite of

474
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:28,010
years left me a is it possible to

475
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:31,380
acquired a total liabilities that were
discovered by

476
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:36,540
third tension Ulster yes of course he of
course

477
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:41,640
so anybody can send data to you and you

478
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,920
have the possibility to change it yes
where the following mechanism

479
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,980
this mechanism was done a

480
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,410
and users cool send us such data

481
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:59,370
they should be able to see what it had
sent those at least offer

482
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:03,440
information about on the benches and we
tell him about the status whether it's

483
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:09,880
arm in the process of of and I can tell
you that as you level vulnerabilities

484
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:15,240
we also should pay attention to because
has your day vulnerabilities in

485
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,570
about wish you we didn't find any
information where

486
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:23,410
source those Park we are working with
them

487
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:29,070
we do come come to the software
developers

488
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:32,350
but if you will send to us information

489
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:36,190
it's going to be confirmed it doesn't
mean it will appear

490
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:42,600
immediately I all planned and will work
with developers with manufacturers of

491
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:55,059
particular software pieces

492
00:31:55,059 --> 00:31:59,259
hello her son Dakota what's what but

493
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:02,700
your there their ability didn't you
think about McInnis

494
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:07,080
according to which June for mission
systems

495
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,039
could receive this information because
if they want to operationally

496
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:18,999
introduce changes into the agency since
yes we do have such a desire but in this

497
00:32:18,999 --> 00:32:19,549
case

498
00:32:19,549 --> 00:32:25,690
where nombre of problems most of the
vulnerabilities are vulnerabilities of

499
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:26,389
love so

500
00:32:26,389 --> 00:32:29,940
work call which can be ruined along with
the

501
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:34,869
upgrade the software is being provided
who

502
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:38,129
Sam configurational vulnerabilities

503
00:32:38,129 --> 00:32:41,220
or settings and other villages credit
configuration

504
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,340
well from the Spaniards wash simpler to
work

505
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:48,360
therefore once again later tell me this

506
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,299
feedback and in forming over developers
manufacturers in

507
00:32:52,299 --> 00:32:55,700
owners about seasons and operators of

508
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,980
status as well right now this mechanism
is being developed and improved

509
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:04,009
and on certain examples we will try to

510
00:33:04,009 --> 00:33:07,529
build it but yes we do have such
objectives

511
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:12,899
which refer to

512
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:17,110
by the following question you have

513
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:20,429
season ice that was certified

514
00:33:20,429 --> 00:33:24,399
and this year they vulnerability

515
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,740
we'd eat have a lot certified

516
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:33,379
for sale shellshock we have

517
00:33:33,379 --> 00:33:40,759
defined that it was certified with what
can be done with such a soft work you

518
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:42,769
know this critical vulnerability

519
00:33:42,769 --> 00:33:47,740
was discovered but the next check will
be in five years

520
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:51,350
well send this information will organize
work on

521
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:54,759
removing this will too because it's not
always well

522
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:58,399
what well it's not always production the
heavens but thats but when you first

523
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,830
you tell us about the shell shock I will
make a another example

524
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:06,620
law specific to Russia by to this system
to human system

525
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:11,110
positive alice is picking so after
shell-shocked have appeared

526
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:15,669
and the first information was published
about it so we did confirm

527
00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:18,810
its truthfulness internal it for
ourselves

528
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:24,870
to always work and to all the developers
and manufacturers some the software

529
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:29,240
the basis of Luminox course

530
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,540
arsenic levels we have sent them letters
so

531
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:36,440
with the decide to remove this problem
and such letters well

532
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,850
speaking about the tel number I will
take 17

533
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:43,630
I will include exclude all swish ok
lolzz in this sphere

534
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:48,090
me in this location will move heaven and
they will be even ten of them so other

535
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:48,850
those stem

536
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:52,409
two-day 5 Jan form boss

537
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:55,620
and how to love them has decided not to
tackle the

538
00:34:55,620 --> 00:35:02,250
and the rest of them has said that this
is a question I import replacement

539
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,320
of everything so everybody else have
told us that we're not

540
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,450
able because we don't have enough people
or weekend not because we don't have

541
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:10,360
enough money

542
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,880
we are just planning of making them

543
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:18,470
so we will work in the following way:

544
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:22,260
those five that were able to do that and

545
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:25,940
were or there will be publication still
fly these

546
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:29,840
product so we'll try to definitely
certify

547
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:34,270
and will certify predator will try to
achieve a temporary vulnerabilities

548
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:35,380
together with them

549
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:39,140
so the secondary situation will happen
after it

550
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:43,710
no the mechanism over great is a very
painful traffic

551
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:47,680
and the for the second year we're
discussing this topic

552
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,860
the so we do propose out

553
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:56,250
show more will have a meeting with the
manufacturers and

554
00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:00,770
other companies that will have another
meeting and will describe the top it all

555
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:01,070
off

556
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:07,430
a threat removal and we do in seas tan
including these

557
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:10,730
document into its location between
tation other

558
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:15,390
as a certified means were me and all
went we

559
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:19,860
do include this procedure in life cycle
the problem therefore

560
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:24,380
we do perfectly understand that we
cannot call for

561
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,350
everybody should look into what we're
going to tell you to call it that all

562
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,900
problems are related

563
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:32,370
we integrity of the call applying this
is sorry

564
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:36,360
a amendments these are all so lovable
problems but

565
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,260
these procedures should be done operate

566
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:45,640
so way to work with manufacturers in
Java some achieve more resolve some

567
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:45,970
issues

568
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:54,820
less result thank you

569
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,490
well continue the topic of the
liabilities

570
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:01,840
yet let's continue course of course I'm

571
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:06,510
apologizing but when we are not going to

572
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:09,430
have any more questions or we are
limited in time I don't think that

573
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:10,930
somebody will kick us out on this rule

574
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:14,770
nope are we will be kicked out of this
room

575
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:18,130
when the time runs out for world

576
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:23,630
Yanshan to

577
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:28,050
I this whole question on this resource
we have

578
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:33,030
analysis for the liabilities do you have
any plans the activities and creating

579
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:37,180
inflation statistics relevant statistics
about the

580
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,540
number of a every threat

581
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:43,590
a losses related to the search

582
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:46,760
well it's a complex question and we

583
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,370
do work in this particular question I'm
not ready to give any particular answer

584
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:50,710
that

585
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:54,300
yes we do plan because these proposals
did come to us

586
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,390
in the process of discussions so

587
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:01,360
we will look at all possibilities our
budgets yes of course

588
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:09,370
this is some the Russian that 12 due to
the fact that I took a lot of your time

589
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,160
so

590
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,990
thank you very much for your tension I
will take my seat

591
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:19,460
well you'll be able to ask questions

592
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,810
after this section little runaway after
it

593
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:25,990
can't seeing that topic of
vulnerabilities in the summation

594
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,790
protection

595
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:33,910
to go see floor is yours

596
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:36,509
hello your colleagues once again
relating to just myself

597
00:38:36,509 --> 00:38:39,529
I'm teaching Rousseff I've the present

598
00:38:39,529 --> 00:38:43,630
a protects companies once again does
should don't we do a devoted love them

599
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,410
in substation all information

600
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:50,489
and mostly work with public company 7
didn't have that in our country

601
00:38:50,489 --> 00:38:54,469
it's kind of a profile discipline
especially for those who are involved in

602
00:38:54,469 --> 00:38:55,339
security

603
00:38:55,339 --> 00:38:58,809
and commercial organizations
historically have been

604
00:38:58,809 --> 00:39:03,390
the purchasing FLUENT software and
hardware but we're not going to speak

605
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,690
about it today today we're going to
speak about questions

606
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:09,690
related to discovered the celebrities in
our case

607
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:13,200
in an hour on a specific topic
discovered a vulnerability

608
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,940
and measures of security measures that
we have to develop

609
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:23,940
and detect but we all perfectly
understand that

610
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:28,029
every security measure is a certain
hardware software Corp texan

611
00:39:28,029 --> 00:39:31,349
sometimes as social conflicts which is
subject to

612
00:39:31,349 --> 00:39:34,880
similar potential threats to which

613
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,999
regular in for assistance such to us

614
00:39:39,999 --> 00:39:44,969
for the for that company this topic of
discussion in the ability year we have a

615
00:39:44,969 --> 00:39:49,049
all product eat happened several years
ago when we have developed it

616
00:39:49,049 --> 00:39:53,359
when we truly star we became

617
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:57,180
nada victim but we started to engage in
with its own

618
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:00,839
expert cool has informed us about the
fact that

619
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:06,039
our product in our present he is
discovered certain vulnerabilities

620
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:10,779
she wrote this letter and we have
discovered this topic for us

621
00:40:10,779 --> 00:40:14,660
because previously we were the area
could make

622
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:19,329
academic company and many of our
competitors are also similar

623
00:40:19,329 --> 00:40:24,279
companies like ours we have been
following the relators

624
00:40:24,279 --> 00:40:27,859
requirements my prediction information
we want to certification

625
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:31,839
Nelson Lee some person writes a slender
hey guys

626
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,819
in your client you have a problem how
can it be exploited

627
00:40:35,819 --> 00:40:38,880
them we immediately started thinking
about the fact that

628
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,880
yes we have to look at these

629
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,930
wealthy enough wide open-ice then we
started

630
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:48,310
actually coming to events similar to
this one

631
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:51,740
we started looking Western truck to sis

632
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:55,150
practices for Microsoft company which

633
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:59,440
you many you know is a leader in
promoting security

634
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,020
talk weekend safe gold topics and we
have discovered for ourselves the same

635
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:04,880
practices

636
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:10,470
do exist inside many other vendors
companies which

637
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:17,010
develop let all the softer what some
networking products

638
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:20,580
Cisco has its only dollar G

639
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:25,360
which is very similar to Microsoft's
methodology so we have started

640
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:32,130
the testing all these on ourselves and
where discovered very interesting things

641
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:33,650
that programmers

642
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:36,820
our programmers everywhere respectively
to which company they work for

643
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:40,430
and programmers fissionable guys

644
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:43,950
day LOV to

645
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:47,860
use new a job I'll said dip court
development

646
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:53,050
techniques and we have discovered
programs that don't really understand

647
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:54,870
security except for those

648
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:58,790
experts in the company who initially you
about this particular problem what

649
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:02,130
information security control of creating
the cryptographic protection of

650
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:02,870
information

651
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:09,490
but they are not develop stocks on the
state that team leaves today

652
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:12,770
are architect's they are and all the
things they are experts

653
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:17,100
the are develop this that's why well

654
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:20,340
for the first time when jected to inch
to use

655
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:24,030
into heart problem practices

656
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:29,260
it is the method of Safeco develop in
the evening we had to overcome

657
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:32,350
verrrrry difficult

658
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:36,160
problems in areas call them related

659
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,430
with misunderstanding and level up
developers by to be needed

660
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:42,470
well experts can just listen

661
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:45,710
all you have to stop look in George
Orwell's

662
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:49,640
your cards priorities cool

663
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,240
will be able to do what first you should
speak about mortal

664
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:53,819
autism

665
00:42:53,819 --> 00:42:57,729
all they've told us model of securities
and threats

666
00:42:57,729 --> 00:43:01,150
and

667
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:04,499
this initial stage Bush

668
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:07,969
became really info for a company to
court hearing

669
00:43:07,969 --> 00:43:14,410
of plus started in our products to apply
this practice is

670
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:17,809
in some cases duo in some cases doing
work

671
00:43:17,809 --> 00:43:23,549
we have learned a lot about our own
products

672
00:43:23,549 --> 00:43:27,019
more or with

673
00:43:27,019 --> 00:43:30,289
even selected in our company

674
00:43:30,289 --> 00:43:34,339
separate sup company pitching in it or
evening with the company

675
00:43:34,339 --> 00:43:38,009
we've concentrated the practical
security

676
00:43:38,009 --> 00:43:42,849
resources and the subsidiary is involved
on a regular basis in checking

677
00:43:42,849 --> 00:43:47,640
all products before they are being
published on the market in Ghent just

678
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:52,690
cation so i think im does help us a lot
because it sure does love

679
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:56,739
interesting things that were discovered
after the product

680
00:43:56,739 --> 00:44:00,359
immediately from the hands of developers
comes to the

681
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:03,729
hands of the experts fact and we think
that

682
00:44:03,729 --> 00:44:07,890
it's not approval that were thinking
about this scheme this

683
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:13,849
source well the life is difficult in one
skilled like to repeat my main

684
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:17,239
thought like earlier

685
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:20,239
E and right now we're following the

686
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:27,410
requiring some regulators we should be
involved in so can shore activities and

687
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:28,349
Austin shit is

688
00:44:28,349 --> 00:44:35,969
the recent years you've told you about
and the turmoil mobility

689
00:44:35,969 --> 00:44:40,979
is in the documents then of course
requirements to check this software for

690
00:44:40,979 --> 00:44:41,949
those for the ability

691
00:44:41,949 --> 00:44:45,140
and the means of protecting the
information I think this is are useful

692
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:45,949
exercises

693
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:49,559
much more useful exercises down
discovering

694
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:53,539
which manufactures Russian well-known
Russian a developer

695
00:44:53,539 --> 00:44:56,589
its better to have a proper requirements

696
00:44:56,589 --> 00:44:59,719
and to show the will also restores
problems

697
00:44:59,719 --> 00:45:01,160
a rather than

698
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:07,860
looking out for their software was
written so

699
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:11,400
the sitch history offering for tix

700
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,500
a lecture and this history

701
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:19,530
about this coming over their abilities
but if you have any questions double

702
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:27,750
def on saddam to me thank you

703
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:32,079
well well started speaking about
analysis and protection interracial

704
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:36,609
fronts labeled

705
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:40,059
floor is yours hello

706
00:45:40,059 --> 00:45:45,430
I represent those companies the spitting
image on which does the analyses

707
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:48,470
of security for the sandwiches

708
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:51,569
us well

709
00:45:51,569 --> 00:45:54,619
AA to talk about which was speaking
about it because we

710
00:45:54,619 --> 00:45:58,160
job working as direction and also
started from the patio into them that

711
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:58,960
was a

712
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,859
involved in CAD data bases up databases

713
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:05,940
we need Russian resource from the

714
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:10,670
many points of view to two main reasons
just about we need to be able to read

715
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:11,260
from

716
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:15,430
for reliable sources that right from a
reliable source

717
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:19,220
because right now the process always
carry over will chillax

718
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:22,609
estranged if you find the program
Russian problem program

719
00:46:22,609 --> 00:46:27,150
you shoot tell about it to them and it
destroys

720
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:30,319
sanso the season said musician

721
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:35,069
and a transport Russell Russian local to

722
00:46:35,069 --> 00:46:40,650
plus then it shows overall the
principles of politicos not all of them

723
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:43,210
can be easily removed him from the first
time

724
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:46,589
that's why if you will statistics

725
00:46:46,589 --> 00:46:50,220
of a little tear removal by billion
vendors

726
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:53,869
this time can reach six months

727
00:46:53,869 --> 00:46:58,000
that's why go from here who will tell
you

728
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,839
course information systems have to be
controlled the and have to be

729
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:09,890
adoptable for realities as well as for
the diabase that we see right now

730
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:15,119
from stack maybe you yes we do right
outcome it's maybe not us publicly as

731
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:16,059
you might think so

732
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:20,450
but would like to do it in go to the
authors but there's one significant risk

733
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:21,540
involved

734
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:25,559
because you should help for he already
out there should be soon your rail

735
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:27,160
station me more than

736
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,309
and by the way there is a very actual
for

737
00:47:30,309 --> 00:47:34,630
the with networking means which do you
lose

738
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:39,730
I you further understand that is certain
is traitor

739
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:45,230
and certain it will hinge Voice will
follow the link

740
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:49,190
which is related to the fore in more
interested link

741
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:52,410
by these human discover

742
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:56,280
disclosed the source from which he gets
out since and he will

743
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:01,410
shoulder or sports where the and she
points to

744
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:05,640
these facilities and in the passive mode
you can do the intelligence operations

745
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,670
against this facility in Russian
Federation well this is just my word

746
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:14,349
and right now coming back to what

747
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:17,510
these database contains and what do we
see yes of course

748
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:21,270
threats they should be updated an
integrated formative

749
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:25,990
police for you more precisely more
clearly I will show it to you

750
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:29,750
but there's a big risk a few will start
really in these

751
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:35,940
the ways of so as well the first or this
is something fundamental I'm speaking

752
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:36,289
about

753
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:39,430
and it's a big risk which is limited say
that these

754
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:42,859
database of the Roses will not be able
to be changed because

755
00:48:42,859 --> 00:48:46,849
well-respected the to what it says but
also was we should be able to change it

756
00:48:46,849 --> 00:48:48,029
because afterwards

757
00:48:48,029 --> 00:48:53,440
mid-level beckons will refer to it and
integrity will start disappearing and

758
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,670
it's not going to be clear

759
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:57,900
how should believe with all this so from
this point of view

760
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:01,160
I would like to go she added it was
written

761
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:04,329
will not change endorse

762
00:49:04,329 --> 00:49:07,569
links wish are available right now de
ser

763
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:10,579
fixed soon things w/e

764
00:49:10,579 --> 00:49:17,819
they should be replenished because the
media center this database of

765
00:49:17,819 --> 00:49:22,010
vulnerabilities is being the weekend but
generally speaking it said

766
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:25,200
crude be eating it says love efforts

767
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:31,970
from for you has a gf by so you don't
have to do this analytical worker

768
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:35,349
partnership every time when you do their
noses of products

769
00:49:35,349 --> 00:49:38,450
and of course this allows us to have

770
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:41,549
very powerful leverage which

771
00:49:41,549 --> 00:49:44,990
makes both developer us

772
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:48,990
and he uses a the product to move
forward

773
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:52,930
and the first solar village in the

774
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:57,850
been speaking about it was discovered in
the product that was removed from city

775
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:02,880
cation from sales and from everything
else so can elicit

776
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,960
market this mechanism didn't exist
baghdad

777
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,190
but generally speaking i digital taking

778
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:13,390
love you a chance I will answer your
questions if you will have any

779
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:16,860
so the key moment I would like to tell
you about right now

780
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:21,160
did visit is really needed in the
morning when you can

781
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:24,850
and do it without the problems you can
write what everyone is database

782
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:29,380
without thinking without thinking a
second thought well he's

783
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:34,640
is it possible to say something or not
the answer well it should be ok for us

784
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:40,090
clearing mechanism of market regulation
because other ways

785
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:45,820
some people already have get effects one
puts its fine by the authority

786
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:50,010
they come to discover some other dudes
in San brothers in the same

787
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:54,320
databases Western database and they have
a question how this was searched

788
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:58,330
was the main reason House issued to you
making sample are you

789
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:02,980
and where under which

790
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:06,230
angle issue look at this mural

791
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:12,180
I think all these problems will be
removed

792
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:16,250
due to availability of social Russia
resource and generally speaking

793
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:20,180
we dupla to use it action the

794
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:26,210
we think that's good too much more deal
much more here for us right reports

795
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:30,200
and just about over so

796
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:34,020
thats H thank you very much space find
yourself

797
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:40,300
if you have any questions I'm here you
can ask me dear colleague so we've been

798
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,490
speaking so fast

799
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:45,760
so the next speaker I Wes

800
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,830
well let ross couple questions or maybe

801
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:53,050
add a little bit especially about the
situation that was given about

802
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:55,910
building threats in

803
00:51:55,910 --> 00:52:00,500
I'll K and is the question of classifier

804
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:03,890
in the year this issue and will work
from them

805
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:11,599
but next year we don't know about all
those detailed questions we know them on

806
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:11,940
them

807
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:15,380
general level and they do remember when
we started speaking about

808
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:19,220
great readers not because we really like
it or don't like the grade

809
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:22,289
but we've been building them

810
00:52:22,289 --> 00:52:27,390
this is a powerful this is a certain
algorithm and it happened at meeting

811
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:28,690
we'd eat have

812
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:32,549
create and businesses et cetera

813
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:36,470
by the workout this additional
indicators and classifiers

814
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:41,730
in order to make it more convenient from
point a view of the

815
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:46,460
in business and general arity and also
do call is a way to tell you

816
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:51,960
once again I'm Tony to you in this is a
traditional call to all love you when

817
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,309
you

818
00:52:52,309 --> 00:52:55,900
right in moscow media s own comments to

819
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:59,010
presentations including the scoring
position please

820
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:02,200
do quilt more correctly

821
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,880
my sis one essentially tied in say that
its new

822
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:09,119
certified I've told you that you

823
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:14,700
certifies products and it was a big
world it was done by SM

824
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:19,200
we jointly together with developers have
been working

825
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,589
they are not new research if I i'm
speaking about the little time since

826
00:53:23,589 --> 00:53:24,299
five companies

827
00:53:24,299 --> 00:53:27,559
and once he will put me into prison 4

828
00:53:27,559 --> 00:53:31,369
the speaking why some they serve your
publications it's been about the upgrade

829
00:53:31,369 --> 00:53:32,170
of threats

830
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:36,549
northern database about its been updated
once a week what is body

831
00:53:36,549 --> 00:53:40,420
you know all the judges have been
updated want every week because you

832
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:44,450
their setup threat information that is a
great once every

833
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:47,500
Qur'an everybody thinks that well the
Wii

834
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:50,480
or working a lot

835
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,540
I'll to achieve certain trample but
you're not following

836
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:58,380
stamp thank you well today at the
interval

837
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:01,580
authentication information is done by

838
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:04,850
experts will provide integrity of the
sort or BGT a few small

839
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:09,210
political wing sein me gute for

840
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:13,580
every percent should lie security
company is seven years ago myself

841
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:18,200
I have weathered Jan

842
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:21,390
years also testing pen testing

843
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:26,070
and 0 well I was shown this side east on
today's

844
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:29,400
I became a bit said well what's
wonderful finally we have

845
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,500
Russian language resource anthology

846
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:38,240
of of Warren CP east's and well it's
wonderful option so I started looking at

847
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,310
this resource

848
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:43,350
and if first think that surprise me as a
practitioner

849
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:48,410
about it's only paper they have not true
pollster

850
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:53,270
any out immediate but the virus or to
all set that will help people to

851
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:54,810
discover this from their abilities

852
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:57,990
it's wonderful that stack works with
Russian

853
00:54:57,990 --> 00:55:01,140
Angeles bought you should understand
that

854
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:04,930
honestly speaking researchers who
discard

855
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:09,400
in certified trials or in other clean
truck just like much so

856
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:14,320
leaves they honestly speaking will
publish its vulnerabilities

857
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:17,390
former solutions tunnel to them see

858
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:20,770
so in any case identify will come

859
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:24,540
the fact that addition they have these
diet base

860
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:30,230
but as a petition a petition hands

861
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:34,060
I don't know how how can we find us for

862
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:37,630
is for example there is Sokolov

863
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:40,980
maxis mind maps automated tools

864
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:44,060
free of charge paid lots which help us
to

865
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:48,580
discover sick when you for example for

866
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:52,990
Russian my spatula

867
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:55,020
to day have the whole

868
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:59,950
whole solve them polish well

869
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:05,280
the as a classicist this database today
so I will tell you my keys

870
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:09,240
I'm surprised that the year 2015 least
see you

871
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:12,550
are we

872
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:16,940
even lead a bigass sess but took office
in the year 1999

873
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:20,810
the other realty at that was assessed on
CSS

874
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:24,710
with the rating 5 all but Van well as
long

875
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:28,950
authorize the transfer of DMSO well

876
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:33,470
wait a sec we see a vulnerability is for
example

877
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:37,300
even today will be speaking about
replication abilities

878
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:41,090
they are more critical parts even though

879
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:44,260
the don't have big raging hands

880
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:48,500
not both chance so what that the
attacker can

881
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:52,330
do if he loans about an is it your
systems

882
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:55,840
well some dollars hellz

883
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:00,420
helps you to get some access to the
information system

884
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:04,200
by local is

885
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:07,280
is dangerous very dangerous 04

886
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:14,350
my private opinion is that we should
make some Russian replacement to CSS

887
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:17,360
more wire waterfall

888
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:21,400
considering all the technologies
Schoenborn into and see a much wider

889
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,070
political abilities

890
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:26,140
I V three Justin levels hearts day

891
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:29,140
and they have ultimate exploits for

892
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:33,970
go was all sports well i'm looking at
that

893
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:38,240
television started thinking how can I
trust this database for example

894
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:42,220
there's a beloved right now I'm looking
at it and vulnerability

895
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:46,890
driver issue to be she's this is Jess
recent

896
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:49,930
ability to relate it to all bath

897
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:54,460
server I S common web server

898
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:57,670
an income noxious though

899
00:57:57,670 --> 00:58:00,780
was in exploit wishes permitted

900
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:04,640
to completely come home I swear so well

901
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:09,560
readable days consumer but it was a fake
actions speak

902
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:12,880
was a fake sale still

903
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:17,230
if you look through the whole database

904
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:20,589
he's he will find certain miss comes

905
00:58:20,589 --> 00:58:24,660
about you know is in a wheelchair

906
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:30,010
not so briefly without keeping you

907
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:33,470
this is my forever opinion as a petition
would

908
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:37,010
base well

909
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:40,420
we still have a lot of work to do

910
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:43,530
and or to develop

911
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:46,839
company and in the future do hope that
will something

912
00:58:46,839 --> 00:58:50,970
my and it will help us searching for
from there do it is

913
00:58:50,970 --> 00:58:54,579
another moment of time visage

914
00:58:54,579 --> 00:58:58,720
ish they are really flat

915
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:02,420
so there's no salt solution which
combines

916
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:06,900
today call is who is speaking yes yes
you have to stop

917
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:10,329
watches of two years see

918
00:59:10,329 --> 00:59:14,280
right well in 2015 yes it it is it
doesn't fit in

919
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:17,770
so the our products which hours

920
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:22,849
to remove their ability advance

921
00:59:22,849 --> 00:59:26,160
and Microsoft in Butte such solutions
it's adults

922
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:29,759
is Sanders right now seriously help us

923
00:59:29,759 --> 00:59:34,780
in getting involved in the morning

924
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:37,329
for example we can take up too much XO
Center

925
00:59:37,329 --> 00:59:41,160
pull up for follow gephardt for

926
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:46,220
minutes away or by

927
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:49,619
in Sterling each update right now
separately

928
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:52,910
I seeing its they're all

929
00:59:52,910 --> 00:59:57,290
up because we have a lot of systems

930
00:59:57,290 --> 01:00:04,609
surrounding us and well this is my
opinion by this database think

931
01:00:04,609 --> 01:00:10,890
rush thank you Celtics also like to see
a couple blocks away

932
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:14,329
say a festival things committee

933
01:00:14,329 --> 01:00:20,130
from which you we want Spanish

934
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:23,780
its ago original requests

935
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:29,380
the more you the more we understand you
asking about partition

936
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:32,089
practitioners which work with us
resources and then we'll have more

937
01:00:32,089 --> 01:00:34,050
opportunity more possibilities

938
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:37,089
and more obligation to complete

939
01:00:37,089 --> 01:00:41,700
the string trusts bring to our the
quality level last long

940
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:45,329
and other event that have been speaking
about

941
01:00:45,329 --> 01:00:49,730
you know 12 also proposals that were
given to us these questions

942
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:52,760
practical questions up there if you

943
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:56,349
those most rations or questions really

944
01:00:56,349 --> 01:01:00,510
systems holes

945
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:04,050
terms things above thinks

946
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:07,450
like these well we may stem

947
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:11,099
we don't have enough that's for I wants
you

948
01:01:11,099 --> 01:01:14,760
well-liked which

949
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,970
late which we should look at this
question critically and we should try

950
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:20,770
proposals in order to be able to work
with them

951
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:25,490
him i'd gene mean something specific
because I will not be able to write

952
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:26,050
everything

953
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:29,069
I was being able to go together with
Michi

954
01:01:29,069 --> 01:01:31,470
his presentation the second

955
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:35,099
and while forming

956
01:01:35,099 --> 01:01:38,800
this resource we have tried

957
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:43,040
against H don't to do certain
revolutions

958
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:46,840
and we didn't want to get hours of
comment trance

959
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:51,750
global trance maybe you're right maybe
you are right from the point of view of

960
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:53,670
necessity of developing

961
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:56,930
old standard war warrant issued to death
we

962
01:01:56,930 --> 01:02:00,520
did make certain specific steps and
standardizing

963
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:04,220
we have developed three national
standards and vulnerabilities

964
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:08,030
two of them already in the or standard
and one more will be sent to

965
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:13,609
very soon and yes of course they have
changes crucial some peculiarities which

966
01:02:13,609 --> 01:02:15,290
one of those will think about it

967
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:19,810
with the Asus but our first main
objective was not to

968
01:02:19,810 --> 01:02:23,160
make any revolutions booked

969
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:27,330
Farrell innovation way as for

970
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:30,500
to meet search intentions

971
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:35,940
we do have plans especially for those
products

972
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:40,619
which well we'll look how the world will
continue because if

973
01:02:40,619 --> 01:02:43,619
where positive nemitz including

974
01:02:43,619 --> 01:02:49,200
from results expert assistance then from
a certain period of time we will

975
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:53,330
introduced mandatory for all russians
scanners which have been certified

976
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:56,980
to use the link of these data base

977
01:02:56,980 --> 01:03:02,020
so will approach other way so we don't
want to do

978
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:05,680
such significant moves in the market
right now

979
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:09,430
but that this is the right direction
which

980
01:03:09,430 --> 01:03:12,599
we are moving

981
01:03:12,599 --> 01:03:17,450
some separate soft workpieces 100 pieces
which also about to meet

982
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:21,390
process discover and unwise to us we do
work in detail

983
01:03:21,390 --> 01:03:24,890
standardized decision on

984
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:28,660
all insurance some other languages were
still working on those questions

985
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:31,810
I think that by the end of the year and
next

986
01:03:31,810 --> 01:03:34,150
event next event

987
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:37,580
on the or other in the event that will
happen

988
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:41,450
or similar type she will have a certain
position down here

989
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:44,760
want to bore the

990
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:47,830
infernos your colleagues

991
01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:51,370
as it should mister way shoot have

992
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:54,840
right like you

993
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:58,800
have said that there there is a next to
the way into but its appeal on the two

994
01:03:58,800 --> 01:03:59,330
doors

995
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:02,860
we should be right that it's not
available we analyze different sources

996
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:04,710
and if we do see information

997
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:07,770
that those availability of a sudden
explosion we have to publish

998
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:10,930
at once again with a to see we law

999
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:14,450
shaking exploits in order for you to
understand the don't ride exploits

1000
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:17,830
and in are worth we to use

1001
01:04:17,830 --> 01:04:21,280
walks a we do analyzed social

1002
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:25,130
court but we don't assemble exploits and
we

1003
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:28,450
don't have any idea of providing
exploits because

1004
01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:32,740
we well little bit objection another
object

1005
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:36,080
and general I would like to say that Eve

1006
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:39,580
according to your opinion but there are
some incorrect readings

1007
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:43,680
you especially said that's why we came
to this presentation that's why we have

1008
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:46,870
open it wouldn't work with these
situation season for all

1009
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:50,230
we could make access to the system only
to the user's

1010
01:04:50,230 --> 01:04:54,710
wage the have applied to buy 65 practice
and then we would

1011
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:58,440
dealing with them and solve this problem
so but what we have opened it

1012
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:02,180
we have done it in all it involved as
much yes but this possible

1013
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:05,670
so this particular work and to look at
all day program

1014
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:10,220
and cultural so freaking much
representation

1015
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:14,220
thank you dear colleagues a lecture
apologized but we already have covered

1016
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:16,090
the next presentation and organismal

1017
01:05:16,090 --> 01:05:19,320
between up so if you have any questions
ask

1018
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:21,140
them also extradition think
