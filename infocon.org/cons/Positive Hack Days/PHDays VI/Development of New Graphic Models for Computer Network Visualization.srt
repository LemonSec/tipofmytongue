1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,020
but soon

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:10,309
my presentation is about developing of
the new graphic models for computer

3
00:00:10,309 --> 00:00:12,910
network visualization

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:18,820
let's just add to the world or
visualization so you'll see these models

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,820
first two older is a representation

6
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:27,849
computer network of the cases that will
be using there are three cases here

7
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:34,210
attacks topologies metrics will be more
than enough

8
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:39,070
how do i visualize that tax so the right
hand side there

9
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:45,160
the metrics which is showing the attack
attack's we have pulses here

10
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:53,739
the vulnerabilities which allow the
hacker to do these attacks so exploited

11
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:55,690
this vulnerability

12
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:02,379
it leads is the record to new host and
sub network connected to can move to

13
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:09,880
another one yet another one so it is
higher than the diagonal

14
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,960
we're moving forward and we're moving
back and dissipation

15
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,020
source and destinations and ports

16
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,070
it was can one machine many ports

17
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:29,720
it's a line and a plane

18
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,870
so you can visualize this a scan and
pattern on the right hand side

19
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:42,410
our world coordinates sources and
destinations and the skin

20
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:49,070
is it easy I'll doing visualize the
metrics and

21
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:53,600
mom you can add Leafs to it

22
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:02,089
so here's a circle the current you can
result in the left hand side of the

23
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:11,690
right hand side you know to the
vulnerability with you

24
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:16,940
which equals nine the outer part is a
result of the previous canning

25
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:24,860
a typical state or the network and the
metrics does not allow us to visualize

26
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:35,720
the most metrics that we can highlight
them with color transparency we do the

27
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:42,709
customization so that we can see the
cells the structures which help us

28
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:48,680
understand what this network is all
about it

29
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:56,399
one of the most effective for ways to
visualize the metrics given fear because

30
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:07,200
it's a spatial we have a router to which
the courses are connected way over this

31
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,140
rectangular with hosts

32
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,548
so an orange one is a router

33
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:20,430
inside there are plenty of routers etc
etc so one router with the one hopes

34
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:29,190
typology graph this is the simplest way
because it's intuitively clear

35
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:35,000
if you need to project a few pirate
isn't apologies and you just use this

36
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
visualization like something right

37
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,640
it costs them their combined

38
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,160
and then they combined again

39
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:58,940
what's a link here and what's related to
where is marked with a color for the

40
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,940
direct lines curves etc

41
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,480
we can be expanded in the shape of a
tree

42
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:17,000
it's so good but it seems like that we
have three base concepts upon which this

43
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,279
models of these

44
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:27,109
what are the concepts the first one is
they're all 11 concept for example we

45
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,630
have called called coordinates

46
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:43,400
even the simplest ground for the sooner
soy de and demonstrate that the tree map

47
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,299
he had

48
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,229
and the graph for the connections we
have some graphic elements

49
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:03,050
so what's developed for India graphic
models

50
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:08,090
what is the trend in visualization first
of all the work with David the

51
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,099
customization of hosts

52
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:20,210
when I was single out what is required
and the encapsulation when we had all

53
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,450
the hosts together

54
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:30,890
so these two graphs is actually one the
next one is designed we have realized

55
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:35,870
finally the design is not effective only
marketed but it's very good for

56
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,870
visualization

57
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:53,709
as far as we can see here is a trend for
the variable design need minimal design

58
00:05:53,709 --> 00:06:00,219
etc and interactive part through the
interactive part of the user is

59
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:04,179
operating with the data through graphics
another revenue

60
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:13,479
it looks good so all of these models and
handsome of deficiencies and they

61
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:15,039
coexist

62
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,669
therefore the graphs have learned

63
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,000
plenty of some free time

64
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:32,460
the free space they pulley visualize the
metrics the trees can only be showing

65
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,460
the hierarchy and the mattresses

66
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,590
they also leave work quite a lot of
space

67
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:50,099
you me and our solution here is to use a
new concept based upon collisions

68
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:58,560
so let us imagine it's our host is our
self and we have a connection with the

69
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,180
host if their cells have no connection

70
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:09,330
we put the separator here at analog a
Libyan just because that's just for

71
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:12,330
example you are in the leathery amazed

72
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,840
only the shining

73
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,460
the nation

74
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,638
you can move from one room to another

75
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:29,270
first call

76
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,270
plenary approach

77
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:40,949
then we have the longest relationship
was a whole imagine these are the nails

78
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:49,949
or put them in a board we apply the one
trying relation keeping the structure

79
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:57,210
serious tax structure was single out the
sales and the diagrams

80
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:06,448
turns out the tiled of the triangulation
will be using the model here and we can

81
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:15,330
identify the host the triangles centers
and we have approximately this structure

82
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:18,330
triangulation and the graphical model

83
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,070
we'll show the separators and the
deficiency

84
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:30,800
we can only apply to one area networks

85
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,340
yeah

86
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,340
this way

87
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:45,130
let's just take a look at their
languages will be comparing it to the

88
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:48,130
graphs

89
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:50,870
mama

90
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:59,660
in our model will be showing the size of
the cell and the vulnerabilities are

91
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,290
here

92
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,290
what does it look like

93
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,950
here

94
00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:13,319
let's compare just threw a special

95
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,910
aspects you perceive it in a better way

96
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:31,239
you need to have a special cases where
you can apply to its subject based upon

97
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,980
looking to expand it to the wrong

98
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:41,050
for example if we make a sectional to it

99
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,050
we will have a prison

100
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:51,839
then we can come up with different
representations we can show it in forms

101
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,839
of cells and lines

102
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:12,529
the next one we're going to put in
different values and we do not serve

103
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:18,050
consider our graphic morning only has
one for visualization of the computer

104
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:28,880
networks but also for visualization of
other pro systems and then we would like

105
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,990
to say that the graphic models

106
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:42,050
other ones that we explore the most one
we we use design we use these concepts

107
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:50,390
and basically I think that our
developments will help us move forward

108
00:10:50,990 --> 00:11:07,220
thank you very much sit across this is
the way to problem you have a gross i

109
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,230
will potentially can which vision

110
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:19,760
did you try and visualize the four
months so it would have a very nice and

111
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:26,569
slick presentation will try to do it for
students and it seems like that he did

112
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,220
not perceive quite right

113
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:33,590
it was very hard on yourself did you
have such experience of visualizing data

114
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:45,020
structures in particular i'm in charge
of gave visualization of the computer

115
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:56,329
networks that can be in the future apply
to the monitoring solutions but you you

116
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:01,220
can do something to visualize the
formats the security formats

117
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:10,500
in fact the way to public very much
similar to the doc bot

118
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,459
thank you
