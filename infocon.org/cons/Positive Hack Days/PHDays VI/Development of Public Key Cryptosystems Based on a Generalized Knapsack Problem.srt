1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
no groaning no

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,359
yes it was supposed to keep getting
years mr. Briscoe

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,139
I'm Yuki is a goose key from the rest of
this car was picking about

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,380
the development of public . crypto
systems based on the generalized

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,380
knapsack problem

6
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,280
iBM has developed a quantum cloud

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,800
what does it mean for you

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,660
cryptographic solutions

9
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:46,489
it means it means the changes of the
cryptographic systems on the tasks as

10
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:49,489
far as the quantum

11
00:00:50,210 --> 00:01:04,069
calculations i would like to briefly
remind you hear about the scale is

12
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:12,119
and the weights we have taken student

13
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,550
home

14
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:21,250
in the early nineteen seventies another
kind of helmet had come up with one of

15
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:27,250
the cryptographic solutions were the
only team they used to understand

16
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,960
let's mention

17
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,690
an additional

18
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:41,690
wait

19
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,130
pitch next way to me

20
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,130
is more than the sum of their all of the
previous ones

21
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:57,360
it is also one of the vulnerabilities of
the picture system such waves allocated

22
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,360
sparsely we

23
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:10,100
knowing that what we need to know about
the defendant says you know that all the

24
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:18,170
possible sums we all of the way to be
unique so that will be able to use all

25
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,640
these weights

26
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:26,089
that's what we're going to do we take a
simple humble weights take a zero

27
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:31,040
take the next number

28
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,640
we had to update the size

29
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,109
and would like to give you a few
examples

30
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,700
yeah

31
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,440
we'll start from zero

32
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,480
going to take to we add - 20 - you're
weird

33
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,200
get three and five and so forth

34
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,660
why do we need it you have to clip the
systems

35
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,640
it would take this from linear
programming

36
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:16,440
what we need to have them we have a
close to keep made out of the closed key

37
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,210
starts from the magics be is made up by
its strings

38
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,640
there can be variable numbers and zeros

39
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,640
e

40
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:41,679
all the all the strings and need to
cover this system

41
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,780
and we can use it

42
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:57,880
we needed to hide that would be me

43
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,510
we r do

44
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,510
new strings here

45
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,030
when we know which strings with added
here

46
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:21,640
now we can resolve it minimal time what
we need to do next when they and equals

47
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:27,270
B we have the maximum number on the
right hand side and doing

48
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:34,620
you choose to make an H metrics which
will be reversible

49
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,650
an open key here is the our metrics

50
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:55,039
what's this encryption of its the
multiplying of the binary vector to the

51
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,700
are open carry it

52
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,700
in terms of the hackers approach

53
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:09,049
the number of equations is less than the
number of the unknowns and the unknowns

54
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,490
are limitations

55
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:20,270
it's one of the tasks encryption is
based apartment

56
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:27,929
reversibility reversibility of the age
metrics we have for this PM equals B

57
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:29,900
system

58
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,099
so what

59
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:39,810
we have this next approach based upon
the i-x it must be that here will have

60
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:44,820
the more homogeneous system and we have
a maximum number of the

61
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,020
selection

62
00:05:54,050 --> 00:06:01,400
perforation the solutions we generate
random vector and would make

63
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:09,050
we're in vectors that open keys and so
we have closed key

64
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:18,010
source metrics which we found the linear
dependence is the public key

65
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:31,249
they really were required to generate a
linear combination so this

66
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:37,159
vectors is where we sum up the binary

67
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:45,570
the song

68
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:53,258
by multiplying live metrics we have
phones battery letters so window and our

69
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:54,090
parents

70
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:57,090
the same system k equals right

71
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,910
that's my presentation i'm done your
questions

72
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:12,990
I was so did he started at the time for
torah in 2002 cooktop published some

73
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,990
work

74
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,050
about the algorithm

75
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:29,130
you did you apply such methods here

76
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,790
avoidable

77
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,289
good

78
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:40,610
- I did that and that work was quite
interesting

79
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:48,940
so I ask a more general question did
using a specific measures to resolve it

80
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:07,630
we're just taking a look at how we
restore the closed key from the open

81
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,630
king

82
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:21,550
the building of some pretty much though
what's the advantage of your advantage

83
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:25,210
as compared to other

84
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,590
standard once

85
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:34,049
the resistance to quantum attack

86
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:37,049
that's the difference but mathematically

87
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,400
yup we're super fun

88
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:51,839
okay i need clarity natives of this suit
was to resolve these tasks certain

89
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,020
algorithms will allow us to do it in a
minimal space of time

90
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,350
the original simplicity of technologists
your purse in your purse

91
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,970
as far as I remember

92
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:25,390
yeah

93
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,130
can you modify this some years of talk

94
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:37,560
all right i remember they were looking
for that loophole and we also did that

95
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,560
and we r we didn't do that

96
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:52,320
what would be the theory assumption we
could not get so the proof of that

97
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,279
theoretically theoretical assumptions
and practice

98
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,480
we didn't want to find units

99
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,649
we wanted to try it out but he didn't
did not happen

100
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:05,790
thank you

101
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,089
thank you for your presentation do this
for just that
