1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,670
nobody me as they would always in you
okay yeah I'm already incurred from

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:12,750
mural security systems center i was
speaking about viruses anti viruses

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,670
android solutions and the research that
we conducted together with my colleagues

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:27,990
but before we start I would like to
start to ascii to ask you how many

5
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,659
android users are here

6
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,270
please raise your hands those of you who
are using an android device

7
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,660
please keep your hand red

8
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,459
raise those who are protected with
antivirus solution

9
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,960
I thought that there would be even your
people here but i have conducted this

10
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:10,380
survey with my colleagues and seems like
the right half as many protected android

11
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:20,490
devices as other devices in our study we
want to take a look and how the

12
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,420
anti-virus applications working

13
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:34,950
by taking an android smart friend and
using 19 top applications we wanted to

14
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,189
show you what would they would be
capable

15
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:45,360
there are plenty of other applications
used here like application manager

16
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:54,630
anti-spam application and are shocked by
the ball you solutions which costs six

17
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,399
thousand rubles and is offering you to
become your financial advisor

18
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:07,500
seems like that the main function of the
antivirus association is malicious

19
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,390
software skinning and that's what they
wanted to do here

20
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:18,510
for this we will need

21
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,819
possession

22
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:30,379
A virus there are plenty of such viruses
on the internet so we wanted to create

23
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:36,888
our own wires but for that we needed to
know which functions we wanted to

24
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:46,099
implement here in the anniversaries are
plenty of your bank in Troy Johnson and

25
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:54,319
we have realized the SMS and into
interception but it did not work out

26
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:00,530
quite completely so we added life data
data encryption here and the phone

27
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,569
blocker

28
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:06,679
k 2 PK we called this miniature software

29
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:12,709
this application was made up of three
parts the first part was an active part

30
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:20,780
it actually it is actually launched with
the application is showing this nice cat

31
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:29,959
the second interception card part is
sniffing through your SMS messages and

32
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,420
the third part is the coming

33
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:40,649
commands us some center message exchange
who had a web service which was a

34
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,510
mission control center

35
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:48,750
i will show it to you later the
implementation of the virus was done in

36
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:54,000
standard ways i would like to show you
that from the active part of the

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,940
application we launched two processes
and the background

38
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,920
the first one to intercept their SMS
messages the second one responsible for

39
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,130
the Mission Control Center data exchange

40
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:18,389
let's take a look at the banking tour
John blueprint someone receives that an

41
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:27,540
SMS message someone reads it through the
file system by sending a mission control

42
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:33,720
command you need to know just the phone
number

43
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:40,800
this message can be sent from that phone
would be deleted

44
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,400
the second way is a little bit more
interesting

45
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:54,180
it's a clear listening way and sniffing
of all of the involvement SMS messages

46
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:10,970
but it's no longer available in android
higher than 4.4 you can use this text

47
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:15,110
message very easily that was not the
only function that was used there

48
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:22,790
it would also block the phone and to
unblock it later and cooked the data and

49
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:36,530
decrypted when people sent you the money
at the first scan the total virus

50
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:39,530
antivirus did not detect it

51
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,940
although in couple of days the situation
changed and that the number of detects

52
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,000
rose - 21

53
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,090
which is a good demonstration of the
data's change between the leader basis

54
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:02,359
and a couple of days with shield 26
detects out of 56

55
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,960
we cannot do more

56
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,960
it was a total wireless

57
00:06:11,249 --> 00:06:14,699
but we're talking here about mobile
applications

58
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,420
so we use the realistic devices

59
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:29,030
that's the testing smartform with 19
applications installed but as you can

60
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:33,739
see this station is not changing only to
detect out of 18

61
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:45,170
these are the only two antivirus is
detected by kaspersky and mg mobile the

62
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:54,050
type of virus was only detected by
kaspersky the mobile virus that there

63
00:06:54,050 --> 00:07:02,090
was a breaching confidentiality other
applications did not see any threats now

64
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:11,539
phone and other five reacted to them as
a robur barcode scanner on the trust me

65
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,810
and you are attracted to kaspersky

66
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:22,910
maybe they know something that we don't
know in a couple weeks visitation

67
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:27,530
changed and six and two hours programs
detected us

68
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:38,690
is that a vast workout and dr. Webber
added that was the maximum number we

69
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:43,430
knew that we would not be able to
achieve more detects and we started the

70
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:53,570
main part of our study to bypass t
antivirus software up through station of

71
00:07:53,570 --> 00:08:00,349
the code is best used here by taking a
few a few skaters and creating our own

72
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:07,970
we wanted to bypass the antivirus
installed on our smartphone

73
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:14,180
we have to a few skaters

74
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:21,919
they can only work with the source court
but word is embedded into android

75
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:35,899
one of the features is that it's the
only one of the other skaters it can

76
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:39,950
delete all the informations even their
strength

77
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:49,970
the second one a letter e features
stronger encryption by using the salt

78
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:56,510
algorithm scan revealed that term

79
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:00,120
apart from that other virus

80
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,860
we use the den droid virus because it's
signatures were familiar to most of

81
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:13,320
their antivirus software and the
modified android from where we removed

82
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,600
some information and some of the
functions

83
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:25,529
after such modification the number of
detects reduced by slightly polishing up

84
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:33,240
the software some of the anti viruses
detected that a lottery is showed a much

85
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,300
better result

86
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:43,800
mainly it was about encryption for the
blood work to reduce the number of

87
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,630
detects is wrong

88
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:53,070
virustotal and mobile antivirus showed
approximately the same trends a part for

89
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,710
most of those two up for skaters

90
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:06,839
we took a few more the features here is
that it can work with white code that

91
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,320
can be a cried throughout the case file

92
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,090
and you don't need to use the source
code of the application here

93
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:18,830
let's take a look at the manifestation
athletes

94
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:28,730
first of all it can add an additional
method here to every class second law

95
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:36,680
it can change the names of the reference
capitalized is changed into capitalized

96
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,079
ABC 123

97
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:54,500
it inserts to go to procedures from the
very beginning till the very end and it

98
00:10:54,500 --> 00:11:02,120
also support the encryption all the
strings of the code

99
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,770
what are the results my Adam

100
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:14,800
the virus table results are averaged
between the Lateran problem

101
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:21,640
mobile antivirus is reduced it to three
detects which is good but it's not

102
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,569
perfect

103
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:25,570
we actually wanted to achieve zero
detective

104
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:35,680
we created our own up for skater just
like Adam it can work with white cold

105
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,630
we called it

106
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:46,840
Eva it can encrypt strength

107
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:53,920
the packets names and creates an
absolutely new structure four buckets

108
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,199
and folders

109
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:06,340
after filling station it has encrypted
them encryption was used here by using

110
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:10,690
sort algorithm with a very monkey

111
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:22,610
the skin and revealed more impressive
results which is the single detect from

112
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:31,490
mobile antivirus ease of us was the only
antivirus which reacted to our cat virus

113
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:40,340
virus total also had the good results
three out of Tennessee but that was not

114
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:48,980
all you can combine different
application methods even simple

115
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:53,180
repackaging reduces the detects a number
of times

116
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:02,330
half of the anti viruses will not detect
you in this case we use Adam and Eve

117
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:11,270
together you'll get the single detect as
well but unlike the mobile device where

118
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,760
our last was the only one performance

119
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:21,860
it was a lot v3 but our vast did not
detect it

120
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,470
kaspersky did not detected one

121
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:33,350
encryption was used as well as other
popular antivirus programs and we

122
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:38,360
thought that that's basically what

123
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:45,260
what's up is requesting what if we
appreciate what's up there were three

124
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,370
ways

125
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:55,160
repackaging Adam and Eve the
modification turned out to be so strong

126
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:02,990
that the application with crash the
application even the fe education is

127
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:12,980
successful the application still wanted
to reinstall itself yet to antivirus

128
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:17,600
accountant and a vast reacted to the
infected files

129
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:25,250
it's the same a vast which really
reacted to our malicious software after

130
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:29,450
Eva application which reveals some
paranoia

131
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:36,239
what would be the conclusion out of it
would be difficult to bypass and mobile

132
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,240
antivirus know what do we really need it

133
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:46,830
do we really need such antiviruses they
do protect us against some of the

134
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:50,040
threats but it's not panacea

135
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,130
just like we were able to pull it off

136
00:14:53,130 --> 00:15:00,420
total antlers you can buy passage of
google plan to play market which we

137
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:05,969
didn't do of course we didn't want to
spread onto hers software

138
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,970
thank you very much i'll be headed to
take your questions

139
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,660
ok

140
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,250
if that crossroad means keep river
national population

141
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:35,720
admin rights related question it
requires just the rights

142
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:41,209
exactly what what's up is doing with the
country require administrator rights

143
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,790
the next

144
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:52,980
do you have detected in one time when
you launch the application

145
00:15:54,090 --> 00:16:01,380
he has some of the anti viruses and the
detect launched but unfortunately not

146
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:06,870
all of them could react to our cats
malicious software and other viruses

147
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:11,970
when we scan it we cannot detect it

148
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:19,080
we were testing it in many ways and some
of the anti viruses that has a function

149
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:25,770
available when it checks all of the
packets global applications and some of

150
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:37,439
them reacted to such viruses but we also
did some complete phone scanning for

151
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,300
every version for obfuscate version for
Android for the cat etc

152
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,020
