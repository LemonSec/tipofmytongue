1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,210
good morning

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:12,149
you're good guys that you're able to
transport your body's here we begin the

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,690
second day of the positive how days and
for the opening of the second day we

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,710
decided to make a presentation collage
from different areas

5
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,600
information security with us

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,789
our experts from positive technologies
to prepare materials and their

7
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:34,890
researchers and stories what is
important today but was important

8
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:44,700
several years ago and what was for
garden questions are welcome

9
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,230
after the presentation of each speaker
you can ask questions

10
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,199
we even have prizes for the most active
one

11
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:10,479
good morning here good morning my name
is Dimitri sclera

12
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,340
I'm the head of application researching
positive technologies money job is

13
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,770
mostly related to the code analysis
reverse engineering some breakthrough

14
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:24,940
things in this area never do happen this
is a very stable and conservative

15
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,880
industry but i would like to convey to
your attention

16
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,710
several facts which came to my attention
in the process of my work and i'm

17
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,798
speaking about them in the course of
many years these are things which are

18
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:40,119
related to many users and they are very
important from the point of view of

19
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:44,679
information security and information
processing and unfortunately people

20
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:47,920
usually ignore those facts and
respectively to the fact that they are

21
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,810
obvious and i would like to bring them
to your attention once again

22
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:59,890
the first thing i would like to speak
about a dangerous related with the use

23
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:05,649
of mobile devices we all are used to
work with desktop computers notebooks

24
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:10,840
and we do know how to more or less
protect information those devices how to

25
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,870
work with information which has to be
protected and those devices but in the

26
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,580
last 10 years in

27
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:21,849
well our life was intrude by smartphones
and tablets so people are used to having

28
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:25,869
convenient thing with them bottle actual
remind you they are not are safe as

29
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:31,090
desktops for example small device that
could be easily lost and then my life

30
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,379
I've never lost desktop or noble but
I've twice lost my ball form it have a

31
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:41,500
long time ago and I'm not are well i
know people who lose their phones three

32
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:48,250
four times a year and your information
could be in handsome compared to

33
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,129
physically big computer which is
protected in the particular facility

34
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,640
protect the truth which has to be
penetrated to take it

35
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,250
mobile phone can be taken out of your
pocket or even stolen in the subway

36
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,519
the light in the light and nothing you
can do with it and you have to consider

37
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,260
this risk in mind because not everybody
drive a private cars with security so

38
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,149
please don't forget about those things
as well

39
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,880
next one smartphones head

40
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,700
less means of for extensions and it's
difficult to add security means which

41
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,619
initially were not provided by the well
as by nature scanner in expensive models

42
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,740
it's a trend and its installed on all
mobile phones even though I've seen

43
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:31,660
mobile phones with fingerprints scholars
before the smartphones but back then it

44
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,290
didn't work right now it's fashionable
and everybody install it

45
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:40,120
but on the smartphone so they have less
security means that on the desktops and

46
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,570
notebooks and they cannot be extended
why did

47
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:49,630
if we protect information on a
smartphone by the password then it's

48
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:54,549
much more difficult to put the password
inside because well password phrase from

49
00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:01,180
28 symbols i can dial in 1.5 seconds in
a hidden motive because i have to look

50
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,980
at the screen because then i type with
two fingers and it's impossible and much

51
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,609
more than a smartphone inch shorter and
easier than desktops

52
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:14,110
if you try to look at the brute forcing
the passwords and I worked in the

53
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:14,950
company for 20

54
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:19,060
yes which was doing password recovery
well it happens that passwords for

55
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,580
smartphones usually they are less a
consultation because smart phone doesn't

56
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:30,070
have powerful processor and you cannot
do big number of things with this

57
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,760
processor and you know users they cannot
wait so the passwords on the

58
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,950
smartphone's they will be a faster in
brute-forcing especially that you can

59
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:45,070
usually do it and powerful machine with
GPU with other things and as a result

60
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,380
it's comfortable thing easy to use don't
get rid of it but you have to compare

61
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,920
risks of using the information on a
smartphone with it cost of this

62
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,880
information

63
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,340
the next thing I would like to tell you
about is a flesh memory

64
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,850
well it came to our live more than 10
years ago

65
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:09,700
right now every second small computer
does have flash memory storage i'm just

66
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,680
being about smartphones and respected it
to the fact that manufactures and

67
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,160
technological companies they have tried
to do it in such a way so we wouldn't

68
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,880
notice this transition so it would be
comfortable in useful by the technology

69
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,740
is

70
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:28,199
not as other carriers and the Magnetic
exist you could record every separate

71
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,330
separately and flash memory you can
record every bite or a bit of

72
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:37,020
information but you can delete only the
full blocks

73
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,159
due to the level dead level of access is
not us on the magnetic carriers

74
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:48,389
manufacturers have inbuilt intermediate
layer which is called trm flash

75
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:53,669
translation layer which is responsible
for transformation of our logical

76
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:57,150
obligation that would like to record
something in the sector with the number

77
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:02,008
153 and then when it's going to be a
recorded well this front flash

78
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:05,580
translation layer besides it but the
biggest problem is not that it will

79
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:10,139
recorder or not but we cannot delete
want to get information for the magnetic

80
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:14,849
fields they have developed standards in
all biggest countries which gave very

81
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:20,789
hard reliability to the deletion of
information Procedures they followed a

82
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:26,400
certain recommended procedures by the
ghost then you could safely give this

83
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,669
scary to anybody else and they will not
be able to restore anything from me but

84
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:33,180
we figured out that and the flash memory
those algorithms work totally

85
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,710
differently because the moment of
deletion is decided not by your

86
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:44,008
recording command but when inside of the
control of fresh memory the procedure

87
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:50,370
which is equal equalizes deletion for
all the blocks otherwise the flesh will

88
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:54,360
come out of exploitation when it was
said that this book has to be deleted

89
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,430
then it will be lit and to make
experiments than even much or is things

90
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:03,479
the standard procedure of secure removal
of the file and then you can pull the

91
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:07,710
fresh memory out of it and you can rig
and you figure out other than seventy

92
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:11,130
percent of cases data can be restored
easily

93
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:17,430
well everything depends on which volume
of disk has been filled the more its

94
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:21,090
full the last chances to restore data of
the deletion

95
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:26,969
but the fact that you cannot give a
command from the or as that will

96
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:30,960
guarantee you deletion of the air on the
flesh carrier irrespective of which type

97
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,210
of Carrie USB flash is d card

98
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,560
this is deedee scared

99
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,380
you in no way we'll be able to delete
data from flesh in the grocery store for

100
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:45,090
confidential data we should be deleted
in a guaranteed way if dangerous useless

101
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,359
because you don't know what's going to
be the consequences and the third thing

102
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,639
that I would like to tell you about

103
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:57,240
it's a USB more than said 3g 4g which
are very popular in recent five years

104
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,650
people buy them with great pleasure
people use them to enter the internet

105
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:05,400
and well people are used to have more
than as a device which is connected to

106
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,719
my computer and plays those commands
that I gave him but more than is a

107
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,440
computer right now my name is a computer
and most likely on the basis of limits

108
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,690
or maybe some in bed of operational
system inside of weight sure they have a

109
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:24,630
basic obligations working in operating
and if you do know how to use the

110
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:31,200
software for open ports you can find
open for 10 minutes and you can find

111
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,968
root access and then you can do this
remember that very you can then on this

112
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:41,820
month damn you can have any software
that more than that I faced at three

113
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,020
years ago

114
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:48,390
deal I see him with linux with utilities
it seems to be done in gb server

115
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,750
whatever you can do with it but the
biggest problem was that if you are not

116
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,980
so advanced to go inside of this morning
and just you just bought it or somebody

117
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,490
gave it to you use to get inside you
start working with you think that you

118
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:04,230
work safely along with the network but
you transfer your data to a certain

119
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,010
computer

120
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:09,120
who decides what should be done with it
well you can still hundred percent of

121
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,230
mirroring and it was difficult but it's
going to go through the 3g can channel

122
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:17,580
that is difficult to control you are not
mobile operator if you would have a high

123
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,360
five

124
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,540
then you would install and sniff and
then you would see what really is there

125
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,530
in 3g it's much more difficult to do so
if somebody getting our modem and you

126
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,670
put it in the store

127
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:32,790
treat it as a public Wi-Fi in the best
case or even worse because other attacks

128
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:37,770
are possible and you shouldn't forget
that the software which has inside of

129
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,260
the morning also has a lot of problems
and bugs

130
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:45,930
there was a team or user statement and
other students from positive where we

131
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:46,829
were telling you

132
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:51,090
how to use more than errors and how can
you make a lot of bad things including

133
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,300
with the user's computer and for this
it's enough to make it to enter a

134
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,349
certain page by social engineering
methods these can be done in a lot of

135
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:03,360
cases easily and on however you can read
an article and how it was accessible in

136
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,390
sugar and going back to reverse
engineering

137
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:11,069
well in recent year we've seen a very
bright event that happened and it's not

138
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:15,930
a unique event but nevertheless what is
indicative of the body

139
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:20,729
there was a vulnerability to publish
that allows from this level to go to

140
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:26,520
administrative system from the guests
level and secret that and develop the

141
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,020
security code for it

142
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,710
the most important thing the most
important threat is that the product was

143
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:38,100
certified by stack and well it's clear
that certification is not protecting you

144
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,130
from anything it's a formal procedure
which cannot be going to see anything

145
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:46,740
and people understand that but speaking
about brother says I was thinking

146
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,730
there's a lot of problem

147
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,200
they are not public you cannot just go
and download internet people who do

148
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:59,520
serious studies in the area for security
while the error was in a core driver so

149
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,260
people who found this error

150
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,680
they look at a lot of different things
they found find a lot of different areas

151
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,150
but if they don't have a search object
if they cannot find the software then

152
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:14,069
basically speaking they cannot research
it and they cannot find errors and the

153
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,310
biggest problem is that serious studies

154
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:21,359
well the protective products and
certified products were not done

155
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:26,490
they are not done due to their a small
distribution and due to difficulty to

156
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,970
get in touch with distributive well
stake has published recommendations

157
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:34,020
about what is to be done with these
vulnerability about the accident that

158
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:40,680
should be done here is that you should
stimulate a owners of the static women

159
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,839
to give out their software for testing
and equipment for testing two

160
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,400
independent researchers who have high
qualification and not just a

161
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,970
certification to state that thinking
it's going to be safer well that's all i

162
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,970
wanted to tell you thank you very much

163
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:02,430
Thank You Dmitry so I have the equation

164
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,469
speaking of other mobile devices and
finger prints

165
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:11,550
well just recently this year there was a
message about a stolen database of

166
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:16,050
fingerprints with the creating a
duplicate set of fingerprints which

167
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,880
could unload the iphone

168
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,180
we understand the problem

169
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,479
The Sun has only one set of fingerprints
they cannot be replaced

170
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:29,160
so you cannot dump them so how do you
see the topics with password on my own

171
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:35,280
password protection voice image video
fingerprints face smell whatever

172
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,550
anything else that can be taken by
mobile phones using the factor of

173
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,069
locality and personification of a device

174
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:45,600
do you see it as an astrological answer
to the problem

175
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:53,640
the authentication or will have
passwords and not nothing will be

176
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,660
changing this

177
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:59,189
well since the year 2000 I've been
working in the industry in restoring the

178
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:03,240
passwords and every year a new research
was published when you report from a

179
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,710
very serious analytical agency which
told passwords will die soon well 15 yes

180
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:11,250
passed since and there's two other main
means of communication of users

181
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,130
passwords is almost for free of charge

182
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,310
well the other thing for the bed usage
of the password you can have a lot of

183
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,910
bad consequences which will cost a lot
of money but initially for the user

184
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:24,540
everything else costs money smart card
costs money fingerprint scanner costs

185
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,439
money

186
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,970
the password for cost you nothing so the
passwords will never disappear

187
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,690
speaking about stealing all the
fingerprints I don't really understand

188
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:37,380
why it became possible because my point
of view the fingerprint is not count as

189
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,580
a picture but there are certain
transformation into a certain vector

190
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,900
format and can we restore the
fingerprint which can be able to the sky

191
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,000
I don't know about the attacks are
different

192
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,630
so if I understand your question
properly then people will invent new

193
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,380
means but I will

194
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:59,240
not be anything ideal BB attacks and
fingerprints 10 years ago people from

195
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:05,120
Cambridge have made a test and for
twenty dollars they faked for twenty

196
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:11,210
cents they faked a fingerprint that
person has left on the flat surface and

197
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:15,680
450 pump they did same thing for the
late and thinking brain which person

198
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,420
have left holding the cup or glass
surface of a table or the handle or

199
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:25,250
anything and they will help of this
effect fingerprint they were able to

200
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,660
authorize themselves out

201
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,140
all fingerprint scanners which were
existed in the market back then which

202
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,560
they have purchased for their research
so they've been violent connecting them

203
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,300
applying this robber fingerprint they've
done with the help of certain chemical

204
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,890
process and all scanners have accepted
this fingerprint as a legal authentic

205
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:43,340
one

206
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,760
same thing with the iphone can be done
so - still a fingerprint it's not the

207
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,020
biggest problem today

208
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,130
fingerprints can be an additional factor
of authorization identification but to

209
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,620
me the only one

210
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,490
thank you very much let's say thanks to
Dimitri for his presentation

211
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:07,760
let's move on Thank You Dmitry Dmitry
you brought us to the topic of

212
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,400
surveillance

213
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,720
my name is also Dimitri a lot of
positive technologies involved in

214
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:22,940
providing providing security to
telecommunications but and technologies

215
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,590
that we use

216
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:30,230
and today I'm going to tell you about
some recent trends of attacks in recent

217
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,260
years a year and a half and maybe if
you're worried about our statistical

218
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,689
information recommendations etc

219
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:45,380
well on the timeline you can see as we
call it the newest history of our

220
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,320
telecom attacks

221
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,160
in telecommunications well you're Harry
I mean mobile phones and the in its

222
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:56,230
recent history of mobile phones mobile
phones or falls in general they were

223
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:02,830
available since nineteen seventies they
had okay seven or ss7 network which gave

224
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:07,780
the beginning to the mornin telephony
then in nineteen to thousands

225
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:11,680
there was a growth while
telecommunication 1g 2g 3g technologies

226
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:20,349
which we currently use I mean gsm 3g and
surprising thing is that that in year

227
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,300
two thousand seven eight nine

228
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:28,719
they started explaining topics about the
security of those protocols and

229
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,570
technologies and for the first time it
was related to radio interfaces and then

230
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:40,330
the word presentations of a different
guys about how gsm can be broken and how

231
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,040
can you restore the keys for it

232
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,630
so with this topic of Breaking and
listen to the radio broadcasting and

233
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:54,040
including the bed ground where the topic
of other networks and India 2008 were

234
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,250
interesting presentations but they
didn't go to public and media so

235
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,430
technical gives they did read them but
considering the fact that all the

236
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:06,310
publications were theoretical without
any demonstrations or anything well

237
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:10,720
journalists were not interested in it so
two years ago in the air doesn't pretend

238
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,530
there was a new boom one innocent not a
number of technical conferences they

239
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:21,699
were telling about unsafe cs7 it
particular and then it was important to

240
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:27,880
have started my colleagues from Germany
researchers all over the world actually

241
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,960
they've been traveling to page these
conferences to other conferences they've

242
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,130
been telling us all those things but the
only one thing was needed that the topic

243
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:39,160
should be picked up by journalists and
the first it was done by journalists

244
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:46,180
from Australia and in others 2015 4 20
minutes they give a topic about how

245
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:50,530
using developers of signal network so
you can follow the location of the user

246
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,389
you can listen to his voice

247
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:56,170
Casey is SMS messages and these guys for
20 minutes was telling about this old

248
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:59,950
topping but from the reality of network
which are 30 years old

249
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:04,299
and he did it in a very interesting way
so interesting that afterwards these a

250
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:08,710
spine talking to these networks and city
captures and other things were published

251
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:13,269
by bloomberg this article please search
for it

252
00:18:13,269 --> 00:18:17,139
i have read it it's a big journalistic
work that was done they've been speaking

253
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:21,908
with interesting day when the nineteen
nineties the small roster was cut by

254
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:26,679
using the proof collected of by MC
catcher and this is non-certified

255
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:31,330
equipment and Department of Police of
some new york state was not able to

256
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,519
legally use it to catch him

257
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:37,929
so the fraudster when he was caught here
many years because of the National from

258
00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:45,010
the United States you can get many years
for them so he got 10 to 15 yes

259
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:50,500
he received a PhD in telecommunications
and law while sitting in prison and for

260
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,669
this year's he figure out what this
simulation have the proof was collected

261
00:18:54,669 --> 00:19:00,880
against him because he's a he appealed
and he left prison little bit earlier

262
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,320
and after that there was a big wave when
people were freed all the way to the

263
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:12,340
cases of attempt of attempted murder
because I said what do you have a prove

264
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,490
that i wanted to kill somebody well with
listening to your conversation how did

265
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:19,210
you listen well with the help of this
this this device want you to wait is it

266
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,919
certified and non-certified ok

267
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:24,850
it breaks out no case and the person
goes to freedom

268
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:31,090
who will complete his mother or whatever
attempt he had and then about month or

269
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,470
two months ago

270
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:38,740
american company CBS republished story
in the from the Australian it's also

271
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,830
called 60 minutes program they have
extended this topic they have told us

272
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:46,449
but the nobility ss7 which allows you to
track to see to listen

273
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:51,100
they have added this information about
the fact that in any smartphone Wi-Fi

274
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:57,159
switch done it's a threat immediately
and sometimes from America have a show

275
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,570
to a journalist how her

276
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:03,730
what's up can be cut of male facebook or
anything and they did it in such a way

277
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,560
so the brothers to the topic

278
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,639
you shouldn't try to appeal to the
attention of telecom operators you

279
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,310
should appeal to you people regular
people

280
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:18,340
how this can influence you and then we
decided to try there was in use about

281
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:23,919
breaking them into telegram and they
decided to look is it easy to compromise

282
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,400
in social networks accounts and what's
up

283
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,800
well it's not difficult we figured out
that means of authentication the

284
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,700
password

285
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:39,040
mobile phone as login the password is
sent as a secret key by SMS

286
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:45,430
so what we've done knowing the through
the SMS and vulnerability is Evan we kgs

287
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:50,410
amantha and we receive access to his
telegram account the same with what's up

288
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:55,030
the and other social networks and this
topic was published everywhere it was

289
00:20:55,030 --> 00:21:00,940
cut by media publications was actually
published and what we have the results

290
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,750
when we've been walking around and
looking to operators

291
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:11,260
they've been ignoring that and right now
we do see that we have to say that

292
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,379
everything that you used today they so
that when a vile internet social

293
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:23,710
networks messengers online banking and
SMS banking even the IOT it's built on

294
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:27,370
the basis of technologies from to
thousands which were built on the basis

295
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:32,469
of the city centre which were project
designed in seventies and but then it

296
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:36,190
was a closed ecosystem and then to
thousands by operators

297
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,450
and then like in regular internet access
to the signal network and the purchase

298
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:50,060
for 3.5 thousand four thousand dollars
in South American that's a 10-4 the

299
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:57,620
intruder it's a possibility to serve you
you to collect your data which

300
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:02,989
information we have collected recent you
don't have allowed cases of surveillance

301
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:09,680
like Geralyn telegram listening to
politicians one year ago it was Merkel

302
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,370
than this

303
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:14,360
your schilder berlusconi was serve you

304
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:21,500
it was not a voice catching me about ss7
but it's much simpler because to other

305
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,190
vulnerabilities person located in
southern American listen to us and in

306
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:29,960
germany by one or any other places he
should follow in directly in fact his

307
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,260
mobile phone or listen to his radio
broadcasting through the encoding

308
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:37,820
because that you can be easily cut but
you can act from the Church of one

309
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,510
country

310
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:42,350
you can listen to a person located in
another country so due to this high

311
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:47,000
tension to this topic was started being
invited to various telecom operators to

312
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:54,440
do so called defense as a seven a
difference object and of its like <time>

313
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,250
seven </time> but for telecom networks
and right now our statistics tells us

314
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:02,210
well it's a bad situation every mobile
network is a vulnerable

315
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:09,650
our data is threatened and hackers have
possibilities to enrich themselves

316
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:13,640
because of that and attacks against
infrastructure is also possible

317
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,900
we have collected this information this
is our sample

318
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:25,250
Raiders who invited us this were big
operators with a database where they

319
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:29,570
were small months down to 10 million
users and big ones 40 60 70 million

320
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:38,720
people in the user base and from regions
as well so that's what we've got in the

321
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,100
result of this research but spine things
listening

322
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:47,060
SMS a caching silver information well we
have learned that Apple Google and

323
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:51,050
Microsoft there watching after us
because we're using the devices who use

324
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,280
their operation system

325
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:57,710
right right now you don't need to be the
manufacturer of the OS or or the smart

326
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:00,050
fortwo kitchen collecting information
about you

327
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:05,540
according to statistics that we have
collected listening to the phone call is

328
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:11,120
possible in every second network
defining the location of the user is

329
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,959
possible

330
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,900
all the time we're reducing this numbers
little bit because there's some

331
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,890
peculiarities of calculation but in
fifty-eight percent of cases were able

332
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:23,690
to track the position of the user so
basically to the sm network you can pin

333
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:27,380
him every 10-15 minutes you can collect
your graphical coordinates of base

334
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,470
stations which provide services to you
and then you put this picture on the map

335
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:37,040
google maps yeah it's all whatever and
you see his movements of the most

336
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,909
important thing is a getting incoming
SMS messages this is the vector which

337
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,670
can be used to get access to the
messenger account

338
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:50,390
II a wallet can you mention in the
beginning you've been surveilled then

339
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:54,320
well somebody can be interested by the
best access to your evolving this is

340
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,909
good topic because it's a way to enrich
yourself and it's interesting too much

341
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:01,790
wider group of people so it will be used

342
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:08,990
definitely so let's continue the fraud
topic right now practically an older

343
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:13,880
network in sixty-seven percent of cases
we have identified a vulnerabilities

344
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:20,330
which can allow attacks against
financial vulnerabilities

345
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:24,710
the first thing of on the name on behalf
of legal a user you can send SMS

346
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:27,350
messages and the roster ken cage

347
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:32,330
Richard SMS messages and so this is the
skin that can be realized when the

348
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,710
mobile commercial study

349
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:39,350
developing for the first time they've
been advertising the fact that users

350
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:44,209
should pay by credit card connected to
the mobile phone or mobile obligations

351
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:50,990
but after market was such a rated and
all the physical entities were involved

352
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:54,020
in it

353
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:58,370
large players came to the situation that
ok everybody have a great cause they're

354
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,529
connected to their mobile phones and
they use it

355
00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:04,850
how can we now take some more money from
that those people who don't have a lot

356
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:09,320
of money and they don't have smartphones
and they have old one smartphone and

357
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:15,320
they had those micro payments by SD SMS
messages short messages a short number

358
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:21,470
of messages because every old market and
motorola is can be used for that and

359
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,110
about six months ago i've been reading
that aliexpress everybody knows about

360
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,219
the store

361
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:28,940
very often when they come to a new
market in the country of third-world

362
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,110
country they'd make partnership
agreements with the mobile operator and

363
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:37,010
their territories of people go to pay
for the products in aliexpress by

364
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:41,299
sending messages to a short numbers and
three five percent very small Commission

365
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:47,240
considering that average ticket in the
Express is like 350 rules because a lot

366
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,049
of cheap stuff is solder but this is the
amount of the money that you have on

367
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:52,039
your mobile phone

368
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:58,460
so the client database is extended even
wider and bigger and there's another

369
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:03,500
thing is a evolve it's in our country
it's a common thing all these terminals

370
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:09,919
where you can pay for utilities and
penalties well I had this evil it

371
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,279
I have to base a penalty for wrong
parking or something like that

372
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:17,929
when my car was evacuated so if you put
into the terminal three thousand rubles

373
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:22,010
500 roubles should be given to you as a
change they don't give you the change

374
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:25,879
they say well give your mobile phone and
i will put this 500 rubles your mobile

375
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:32,960
phone and that's how i received these e
volat system and by the way to register

376
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,620
and to enter through this interface I
had to put my mobile phone i forget the

377
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:40,489
password so i asked them to send the SMS
with a cold to restore it

378
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:43,610
consider the fact that roster can on my
behalf

379
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:44,689
send SMS message

380
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:48,290
you can receive them on my behalf and he
can receive access to these mobile phone

381
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:50,690
evolving and your cell

382
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:56,990
there are millions of this eve allots
from some people can store big amounts

383
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,340
of money on those evil person

384
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:03,649
they can be stolen so the damage is very
high damage could be a high and

385
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:08,180
vulnerable networks to this vector of
attack they show us that even SMS

386
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:17,690
banking system not country we have a
popular bank which connects just think

387
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:22,910
about SMS banking system by this
vulnerabilities SMS can be easily sent

388
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,410
from the user

389
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:27,800
so any amount of money can be certified
for transfer

390
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,940
not big amounts can be certified because
payments are limited by three thousand

391
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,530
rubles for the SMS messages

392
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:36,860
three thousand roubles from so many
users while you can get a lot of money

393
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,669
it's not nice when you cannot send a
message to somebody or call somebody

394
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:48,710
but can you consider the gigantic IOT
structure using 3g communications and if

395
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:54,620
all these networks at certainly plan
will be extinguished sensor response and

396
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:58,760
other things will become unavailable and
this can cause very serious accident and

397
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,690
maybe some technology any consequences
which will not be really nice

398
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:05,930
and as a recommendation well two
operators of telecom operators we've

399
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:11,480
taken the recommendations to after are
all dates and two people not to rely on

400
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,750
safer conversations from about phone sir

401
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,930
personal meetings out there are much
better than mobile phones and feel about

402
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:21,890
messengers that we should use double
identification

403
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:25,850
it makes their use is not so convenient
but little bit more protected

404
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:29,629
well that's all over the Challenger and
right now bladder will continue

405
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:42,830
good morning we're going to tell you
about some attack vectors we often

406
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:48,169
forget about which could be successfully
realized and can lead to a very big

407
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:49,550
damage

408
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:52,550
many people know number hundred
forty-six percent

409
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:58,310
however FBI have doubled this number and
they say that attacks with compromising

410
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,840
corporate emails

411
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:06,530
they've gone by two seventy percent of x
2.7 times and average damage from one

412
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:14,030
the tag is between from 25 to 75
thousand US dollars per victim and there

413
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:20,420
are cases when they enter up to 5
million dollars they still up 25 million

414
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:24,920
dollars and we did face a situation of
an attempt of this attack but we're

415
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,600
lucky

416
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:32,270
I've been speaking of the event from the
ib group about fraud I've been making a

417
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:35,330
presentation i was in london way before
that

418
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:41,600
I've told him that this happens and same
day when I was speaking all day before

419
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,070
that we receive a similar phishing
attempt one on behalf of the director of

420
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:51,290
a company along the office will receive
a letter and how much money do we have

421
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:56,990
on the account director says well send
me the money with a simple case

422
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:00,800
sometimes there could be some other
situation the simplest case is when they

423
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:06,050
use a fraud mail which it does not
comply to the corporate domain like in a

424
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:09,169
given case that will been able to figure
it out everything was clear and

425
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,040
understandable

426
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:15,980
there are even worse cases when they
break into by a civil trial they break

427
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:20,330
one of the machines and then with legal
email of an employed a sense in

428
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:26,360
literature not employee and then we
should use alternative means of

429
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,479
communications you should call him you
should send an SMS message

430
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,720
don't use that computer which
potentially could be compromised

431
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,200
alternative devices should be used
alternative accounts should be used in

432
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,140
order to understand whether you need it
or not

433
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:43,879
and the third set keys was when they
break email

434
00:31:43,879 --> 00:31:49,248
mark us by the trusted partner and they
start behaving on his account

435
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:57,649
let's go back to our case along the
office IP address of the provider also

436
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:03,349
in the United Kingdom and we decided to
play in this game and to understand what

437
00:32:03,349 --> 00:32:05,178
do they really want from us

438
00:32:05,179 --> 00:32:09,409
so the person have replied that we have
hundred thirty-five thousand dollars in

439
00:32:09,409 --> 00:32:11,329
our account to transfer money

440
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:17,448
what he needs and the following banking
represents and that's how we started to

441
00:32:17,449 --> 00:32:21,649
play with this person he continued the
game he said the bank a he wanted this

442
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:23,629
money to be self

443
00:32:23,629 --> 00:32:29,599
it's a hungry and we don't have serious
business in that particular country and

444
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:32,208
our manager our director was another
country

445
00:32:32,209 --> 00:32:37,879
well of course we use this information
to our channels and with transfer this

446
00:32:37,879 --> 00:32:40,309
information to reduce potential risks

447
00:32:40,309 --> 00:32:48,769
- coordinating centers to our experts
and then we decided to extend some time

448
00:32:48,769 --> 00:32:53,809
to make a decision on what is to be done
afterwards how we've been pulling time

449
00:32:53,809 --> 00:32:59,239
we say that yes we do have a problem
because we have some special teams that

450
00:32:59,239 --> 00:33:04,099
are to be made and we've been pulling
time by several days during those dates

451
00:33:04,099 --> 00:33:06,499
we've been collecting additional
information we've been thinking what

452
00:33:06,499 --> 00:33:13,129
should be done with that afterwards and
the Walton it but the person was

453
00:33:13,129 --> 00:33:18,079
impatient and he said how did you
receive or didn't you receive my request

454
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:21,859
for money amateur record give this money
to me or you'll be fired

455
00:33:21,859 --> 00:33:30,198
then we have pulled a little bit more
time more than a week has passed since

456
00:33:30,199 --> 00:33:37,069
that and we said that we cannot transfer
this money to you because he talkin that

457
00:33:37,069 --> 00:33:43,668
is required for payment transfers and
needed and after these are you really

458
00:33:43,669 --> 00:33:45,440
have disappeared

459
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,629
we did have some headers of those
letters all the headers they did comply

460
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:56,658
to the addresses legitimate UK addresses
and the attack was not against our

461
00:33:56,659 --> 00:34:01,909
company but on the list of companies
that were on the territory of the united

462
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:02,720
kingdom

463
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,759
we're lucky because we are so a word but
there were some other victims were not

464
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:13,460
like as us who followed it and in some
cases maybe it was used for money

465
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:18,679
laundering or maybe they received it for
personal data and a few cases in Taiwan

466
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:23,149
with the delivery of electronic
components were whether a letter was

467
00:34:23,149 --> 00:34:29,509
sent from legal partners network we have
changed our requisites can you send

468
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:34,460
money these to this account 65 thousand
dollars for everything was a pulled in

469
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:39,949
reverse direction when a client of
components supplier of his name was

470
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:49,790
broken and he says and he says this time
we need 10,000 mobile form shells not

471
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:54,440
for this address but can you send them
to Zimbabwe and people did send them to

472
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,960
Zimbabwe brothers without paying anybody

473
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:06,440
well another said trend is basically on
the dark side of the force that are

474
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,010
talented people in the dark side of the
force but did in fact that many

475
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:13,609
incidents rd are published in the mass
media

476
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:19,009
it happens that as some simpler people
date just read trends in use and they

477
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,690
copy this behavior

478
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:26,210
the copycatting and this can be seen in
DDoS attacks and other attacks when

479
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:33,950
something has been encoded for example
when these attacks over the down

480
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:38,390
they use encryption algorithms which
allowed us to restore data after doing

481
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:44,450
10 minute analysis of files for example
first bite of the header was changed and

482
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:48,020
then they recorded into the end of the
file and you made a screen for ten

483
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:51,440
lights and restored the encryption
without paying money but then they

484
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,849
started using good

485
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:58,340
cryptography many keys on the victims
machine could be interfered and

486
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:01,610
restored that the starter generating
their own server and they didn't have

487
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:06,650
any options and then suddenly they
started having options when you see on

488
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:10,160
this program called software called and
you see everything like five years ago

489
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,140
which tells us that by defending
yourself from those threats

490
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:19,100
sometimes better do nothing in our case
you receive a letter

491
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:26,000
can you pay as 30 bitcoins and you have
a DDoS attack and at the same time if

492
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,430
you clearly understand the word comes
from with a probability of seventy to

493
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:33,230
eighty percent in 10 minutes

494
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:38,270
it will end because people don't have
enough money to rent in the service and

495
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:44,840
it will be my simple for them to switch
to another victim instead of organizing

496
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,340
serious back against you

497
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:54,440
so be attentive to those who are taking
you protect you learn more thank you

498
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,440
very much

499
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,220
germany question

500
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:10,689
is there no questions everybody to feel
threatened and fearful i think five to

501
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,930
ten dollars

502
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,930
I didn't hear the question because it's
not asking the microphone

503
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:19,800
yeah

504
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,970
well speaking from the other side I'm
speaking not from the tech side but i'm

505
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:28,950
speaking about racial on how many
letters people have received any of tags

506
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:32,879
do you have in for 10 minutes or 30
minutes and having it were the repeated

507
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,630
here for attacks because we're coming
from the practical side how it was and

508
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,700
not from decide how this could be done

509
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,790
I don't hear the equation

510
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:53,490
our advice is a serious group is against
you like was with a bit convict before

511
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:57,240
they went to prison there's a chance
that it will be cheaper to wait because

512
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,470
for this hour

513
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:01,980
if you have not prepared yourself you
will not be able to do anything but if

514
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:07,320
you will pay you will lose money and you
will not get defense at least you will

515
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,340
try to pull time

516
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:14,730
just pull the time it's a question about
his status what do you mean by waiting

517
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:19,470
starting negotiations with a processor
is to hear of the interest yourself if

518
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:23,490
you don't have a plan of action well
maybe it makes sense just to say silent

519
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:27,660
and he will fall away or to make a plan
of action search for some assistance

520
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:34,380
inside of the company and the dialogue
will be considered as a possibility to

521
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:37,710
monetize and this attack will be
continued and it will take more than an

522
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:38,400
hour

523
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,350
so what is the option well I just wanted
to add to a Lexus statement

524
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:48,630
yes criminal he makes an attempt his
searches for open doors

525
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:52,620
he tries many doors and he is able to
enter any door

526
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:57,509
he will not try to break into the closed
door he will look for muslim simple way

527
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:01,980
of receiving money if it didn't work in
one case he goes to another one for you

528
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:06,780
it's not in your not interesting to you
well as an object only your volunteers

529
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,800
interesting to him he doesn't care who
should be broken he doesn't care shoot

530
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,480
who should be broken and if it's a mass
attack if it's a target a tank well

531
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:21,510
another tactic should be used and there
should be a mass command that is

532
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:25,230
dedicated for you if it's a target one
and it will be serious

533
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:30,030
it will not be limited by simple details
another small comment

534
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:36,420
there's an indicator which recently
worked many times when there was a mass

535
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:41,010
letter distribution with one address of
Bitcoin wallet

536
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:45,720
the attackers physically will not be
understanding who paid to them so it's a

537
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,980
sign of searching for open doors and
it's not coming for them to not for the

538
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,980
second time

539
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:13,669
hi everyone i will continue the topic of
what Julia said making money by

540
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:18,230
fraudsters my name is Anton Anton
checking in positive technologist

541
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:22,460
I work on defending the mobile
applications and we very often receive

542
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:27,980
applications of requests for mass media
from telecom operators from banks about

543
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:35,869
analyzing fraudulent software through
but of course we have to understand and

544
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:41,119
sometimes we do analyze such
applications and i would like to say

545
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:49,460
couple of words but which applications
were in the initial stage and how

546
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:54,410
different systems have been defending
themselves from this malicious God was

547
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,410
here

548
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:04,490
mass media had a news that there is at
royal for android we stills money from

549
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:12,470
the accounts of users of burbank users
respectively to the fact that it was the

550
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:21,680
a dozen 15 the Troy on was a simple one
simple trying schools were using 2012

551
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,669
2011

552
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:29,480
well this fear of mobile trends was
growing

553
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:35,839
of course it did have certain methods
which prevented its deletion from the

554
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,690
system but basically speaking it was a
very simple

555
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:49,910
Troy and software how did it work the
criminal in some way have spoke to this

556
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:53,629
application for beta obligation or some
other application made user to install

557
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:58,940
it and his android mobile phone then
after these criminal by knowing your

558
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,890
mobile number

559
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:03,980
it's very easy to receive it if you have
installed an obligation

560
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:10,759
he requested restoration of the password
for the internet bank

561
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:19,490
these true and have the functionality of
catching the SMS messages after the

562
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:25,220
installation user have seen the
notification that this application will

563
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:31,819
read SMS messages but many users they
don't really think about it and they say

564
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:37,970
yes okay if it's a game especially the
application kitchens this use SMS

565
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:43,879
messages and delete it from base and the
fact that it's been deleted and you

566
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:47,720
cannot see it in the list of SMS
messages you don't even receive a

567
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:52,520
notification that this SMS message was
sent to you has arrived so you don't

568
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:57,650
know that destroying have just catch
your password that was sent to you after

569
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:02,570
these froster with this passport enters
your internet bank makes a transaction

570
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:04,369
and for this transaction

571
00:43:04,369 --> 00:43:08,030
you need one time password he also
catches it in the same way

572
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:13,520
so what is the advantage for the
fraudster from the criminal of these

573
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,220
applications easy to development

574
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:20,270
if you never had an experience of
developing for Android but you can

575
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:25,400
understand how to write an application
and you have certain experience in

576
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:31,940
programming in 23 days you can write
such a drawing very easily so that's why

577
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:39,770
it was it became so common big number of
different variations of it were

578
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:44,390
available in the market in these trying
for Spain make i was really surprised

579
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:50,598
that it came so late to the market in
addition to that such droids can be used

580
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:54,349
not for one bank but for number of banks
for thousands of things because

581
00:43:54,349 --> 00:43:55,700
everything that can be done

582
00:43:55,700 --> 00:44:00,200
you just can't change the SMS message
you do a template for different banks

583
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,470
and then you catch messages nothing
difficult than that

584
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:08,990
so what are the disadvantages for the
fraudsters of this approach for these

585
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:12,890
fraudulent applications first of all the
difficulty of distribution if at the

586
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:17,450
initial stage this application will be
downloaded to google play and with high

587
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:19,730
level of probability it wouldn't be
deleted in there

588
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:25,700
a long period of time right now
automatic mechanisms and services in

589
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:29,299
Google they will discover this
application then they will not allow it

590
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:35,660
for publication and goodly or they will
delete it in day or two and want to get

591
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:44,149
high risk of discovery application needs
access to SMS messages and if you are

592
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:49,850
shared user and you take care of your
security which by seeing that

593
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:57,200
application for example game asks for
accessing your SMS messages you should

594
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,939
install this application so years have
passed

595
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:09,109
as I told you the first similar true
answer appeared in 2011 in 2012

596
00:45:09,109 --> 00:45:12,380
there was a big boom of those
applications they grown by thousand

597
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:17,000
percent on the market and a lot of
different versions have appeared in the

598
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:27,020
market and the first not in the first
but google summon banks have understood

599
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:31,970
that they should keep themselves and
they safe side from the such troy ounce

600
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:38,990
google has made two things first thing
just recently in a 60 version of Android

601
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:43,310
they have a dynamic distribution of
privileges if an application wants to

602
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:45,320
get access to SMS messages

603
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:49,490
it cannot request these privileges at
the moment of installation

604
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:56,689
he should request on the moment of work
we can say that it protects you that

605
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:58,700
much because you've pressed

606
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:02,450
okay at the moment of our installation
we'll press ok the moment of operation

607
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:11,419
but nevertheless i can say for the user
it's more easy to discover that

608
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:15,859
application wants to get access to their
semester of the given act then the

609
00:46:15,859 --> 00:46:20,119
principle of reciprocation of SMS
messages have changed

610
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:26,510
if previously SMS message could be
received and deleted from the database

611
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:30,170
immediately by them so that user
couldn't see it right now it's

612
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:31,380
impossible to do

613
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:35,849
so you can write an application that
will receive a sense message but it will

614
00:46:35,849 --> 00:46:40,829
be stored in your database where you
will be able to see in the least of SMS

615
00:46:40,829 --> 00:46:43,799
messages and you will not be able to
simply delete it

616
00:46:43,799 --> 00:46:54,329
banks have also tried to protect our
users and the only thing they've done

617
00:46:55,140 --> 00:47:00,779
not all the bangs but i would say only
few of them they've denied a certain

618
00:47:00,779 --> 00:47:08,700
amount of time from using classical SMS
messages they started stopped using this

619
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:12,990
for methods 0 plus SMS

620
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:20,549
so basically it's the same SMS the main
difference is that in the Android one

621
00:47:20,549 --> 00:47:25,440
while going to the Android when it
doesn't contact with applications

622
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,859
installed in the system it immediately
goes to the system applications so

623
00:47:28,859 --> 00:47:36,538
certain class and then you see popping
window popup window you can see the many

624
00:47:36,539 --> 00:47:43,710
banks especially lot of talk time they
use these technology network initiated

625
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:48,900
ussd this is the same us SD command but
it's not your call initiated from the

626
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,839
mobile phone but it's been initiated by
operator

627
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:59,369
it looks on your mobile.phone the same
way as the SMS messages so you cannot

628
00:47:59,369 --> 00:48:05,009
see the difference between them at once
again

629
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:11,359
malicious code cannot catch this command

630
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:19,640
the third method is more exotic one
which not many banks have done

631
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:24,049
it's creating outlets on the same card

632
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:30,770
you don't get SMS you don't get SSD
comment but you receive a package which

633
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:32,960
is sent by operator

634
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,819
it's a small yellow upload installed on
a sim card

635
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:48,470
meaning by that that malicious code will
not be able to catch these package but

636
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:57,890
as we can see from our research which
you can read on habra using a

637
00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:06,078
vulnerability in the android which later
were fixed in the version 51 after our

638
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:12,410
reports the militia scored using this
vulnerabilities can intercept any

639
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:19,759
message which same God sense to android
device but this is exotic method

640
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,740
not applicable some banks did want to
use it

641
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:32,509
well this is the first three ways there
are universal they can be used for

642
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:34,670
mobile banks and for regular banks

643
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:39,109
there's no difference and they look very
similar the fourth matter based on the

644
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:44,119
use of google cloud messaging and push
messages

645
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:50,660
it is used by him about banks with
modification which is registered on the

646
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:56,270
google cloud messaging network and
one-time passwords or restoration past

647
00:49:56,270 --> 00:50:03,619
passwords it comes to this application
through the google service in a common

648
00:50:03,619 --> 00:50:06,250
case

649
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:10,540
android devices it's a little painting
is used to get connected to the Google

650
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:17,350
service and by listening y5
communication and using when the middle

651
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:20,350
attack it's almost impossible to catch
them to intercept them

652
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:23,529
nevertheless for the fourth

653
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:28,750
ask for the first time the second
methods the opposite possible attacks

654
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:36,880
the attacks consists of the following
that many mobile applications are

655
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:41,770
improperly realized the work with the
data they receive a simple example that

656
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:49,840
we can use and we didn't have it in one
of the projects mobile bank receives one

657
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:57,280
time password through google cloud
messaging meaning that other

658
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,810
applications will be able to see it but
at the same time due to the fact that

659
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:07,509
mobile banking application has a
vulnerability and it's called this

660
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:11,740
mobile Bank starts sending this one-time
password

661
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:16,479
- all applications installed in the
system so if you have found this

662
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,350
vulnerability in the global bank you can
easy right

663
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:27,610
a malicious called which simply speaking
will not require any privileges

664
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:32,440
it will not require access to SMS
messages it will not access even access

665
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:37,870
to the Internet to transfer these
one-time password received by all you

666
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:45,759
need is to listen to this particular
application for this password in this

667
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:50,230
case were approaching the situation that
in the future we can see a possibility

668
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:57,430
of appearance of new types of bile
trillions banking trillions which are

669
00:51:57,430 --> 00:52:01,330
directed on listening and exploitation
of the nervous system of our

670
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:02,470
applications

671
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:05,470
this method does have two significant
disadvantages

672
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:13,549
it's not easy to write it but it was
difficult it is to find these

673
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:17,840
vulnerabilities for this unit time for
this you need good hackers researchers

674
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:21,530
who will research and search in
different mobile banking applications

675
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:25,670
this vulnerability and then we'll put
their functionality in the software of

676
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:31,430
this particular trial application and
the second dissidence it disadvantage is

677
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:33,259
a very narrow specialization

678
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:38,210
if you found it in one bank it doesn't
necessarily mean this vulnerability will

679
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:40,310
be operational in other paints

680
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:47,990
this method has two advantages easy
distribution

681
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:55,430
no antivirus will never be able to
detect this attack because with android

682
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:56,450
system

683
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:59,450
this behavior is legitimate listening

684
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:06,109
it doesn't send any messages or anything
antiviruses don't have those signatures

685
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:10,970
of this moment of time and they cannot
discover that and plus a low risk of

686
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:16,490
discovery so you can write application
which will not ask for any rules and of

687
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:19,399
course the user will easily try this
application because people believe that

688
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:24,380
it cannot do something because it
doesn't ask for anything which are the

689
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:30,470
mechanisms of defending yourself how can
you defend yourself from this particular

690
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:32,029
in android

691
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:38,720
not because android system built in such
a way that it allows for such

692
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:42,049
vulnerabilities to be exploited for the
banks

693
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:45,080
it's much easier

694
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:50,920
banks should analyze their software code
of the applications to search for such

695
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,150
vulnerabilities

696
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:56,440
they should follow the methodology of
writing the safe code as a mask and then

697
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:00,430
they should the regular analysis of
protection

698
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:07,240
that's all I wanted to tell you thank
you very much ok we're little time left

699
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:15,190
we have two small presentations right
now it's going to be our sydney is going

700
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:18,190
to tell us about

701
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:28,569
in marshalls emotions in the area of
malicious code

702
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:33,220
well what was it what was it what was it
was here

703
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:40,810
ok hi everyone I'm they are cine field
of three minutes

704
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:46,029
i'm researching security of applications
and today i would like to tell you

705
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:56,320
basic problem as Brent vulnerabilities
had paid drawn poodle and other ones

706
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,690
before the presentation

707
00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:05,230
I have figured out that today it's a 15
days since the last longer branded for

708
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:07,330
their ability to bridge

709
00:55:07,330 --> 00:55:14,200
it's a picture from twitter account of
infoset have tracker which by accident

710
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:17,080
that publishers every day

711
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:21,490
how many days have passed since the last
the publication of such for the reality

712
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:26,560
of our survivability today I didn't
check my Twitter but i do hope not

713
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:29,710
changes and vulnerabilities have been
published yet

714
00:55:34,779 --> 00:55:41,409
so the experience of naming the
vulnerabilities came from a be in the TV

715
00:55:41,409 --> 00:55:43,659
industry and travel industry

716
00:55:43,659 --> 00:55:46,659
well known viruses like Code Red Morris

717
00:55:47,229 --> 00:55:50,229
i love u Conn flickr other ones

718
00:55:51,579 --> 00:55:55,150
so the first and the most significant
brand

719
00:55:55,749 --> 00:56:01,359
it was of course heartbeat I think each
one of you do know what we're speaking

720
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:06,788
about this vulnerability

721
00:56:08,259 --> 00:56:17,319
you know they had be a little bug but
after the heartbeat i would like to

722
00:56:17,319 --> 00:56:21,699
point out that all other brands they
just tried to Reese repeat heartbleed

723
00:56:21,699 --> 00:56:24,249
success

724
00:56:24,249 --> 00:56:30,999
same as reported to drown that work only
in certain versions of SL and basically

725
00:56:30,999 --> 00:56:34,058
it was not such a big threat as a
heartbeat

726
00:56:34,569 --> 00:56:37,599
of course shell shock

727
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:47,619
this vulnerability didn't receive a
nomination for the most useless

728
00:56:47,619 --> 00:56:54,939
vulnerability which almost cannot be
used in practice and you can also

729
00:56:54,939 --> 00:56:57,428
remember about overhyped host

730
00:56:57,429 --> 00:57:02,619
there was a lot of articles dedicated to
it about big overestimation of its

731
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:03,759
threat

732
00:57:03,759 --> 00:57:07,749
venom vulnerability

733
00:57:07,749 --> 00:57:10,749
it's a very interesting story

734
00:57:11,439 --> 00:57:17,919
crowd security can strike they took the
old vulnerability in hypervisors and

735
00:57:17,919 --> 00:57:23,109
they shown it as their own vulnerability
like they have discovered it but there

736
00:57:23,109 --> 00:57:26,140
was nothing but just simple marketing
and

737
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:34,900
one of the racing from their abilities
bed lock in some ball was only with

738
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:35,620
meetin

739
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:40,210
it was announced they have created
certain side law go

740
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:45,730
everything perfectly two weeks before
the publication of any details about

741
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:52,720
this vulnerability and immediately there
was a party a side with a said lock

742
00:57:52,720 --> 00:58:02,680
brand were the others have expressed
their misunderstanding about such hype

743
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:05,680
vulnerabilities like deadlock

744
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:12,160
what is interesting here is a fact that
this vulnerability was discovered by

745
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:15,339
that person who produced that code

746
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:25,240
what was found the order of the code and
this scheme you can see that not all

747
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:29,259
logged the vulnerabilities brother
abilities are so dangerous

748
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:36,040
on the right side you can see those
which are truthfully three threatening

749
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:41,200
ones and the left side those which are
in principle not so threatening and in

750
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,180
the middle you see the cross section

751
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:50,290
you see these three other abilities that
were considered to be dangerous one

752
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:54,790
like but not like our be in the last of
our ability that I've heard about the 15

753
00:58:54,790 --> 00:59:00,940
days ago its image tragic i would call
it an exception from rules because this

754
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:07,630
vulnerabilities are really of a high
threat level it is present in a

755
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:08,620
component

756
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:14,980
well not like imagemagick for processing
images and this component can be used in

757
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:16,990
white cases and many sides

758
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:25,299
that's why you can say that it's almost
a heartbeat but i would put an equal

759
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:27,190
mark between them

760
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:33,040
everybody's waiting for the next
heartbleed something that will get over

761
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:38,319
its glory is a picture from the picture
that was published the first of april in

762
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:45,190
20 I blog and you can see this
interesting collage from different

763
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:48,310
vulnerabilities that can be used

764
00:59:48,310 --> 00:59:51,339
well thank you very much for your
attention thank you see me it's a very

765
00:59:51,339 --> 00:59:52,599
interesting selection

766
00:59:52,599 --> 00:59:56,109
you understand that you have prepared of
these for this conference

767
00:59:56,109 --> 01:00:05,020
it shows that not only researchers and
developers are interested in getting

768
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:11,890
attention and publicity mass media but
those who use this from their abilities

769
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:16,930
they also tried to earn some glory for
themselves and the final floor is given

770
01:00:16,930 --> 01:00:22,000
to you Lee war on the right and she's
going to tell you everything about what

771
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,470
you've heard about it and it

772
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:27,098
how does it reflect those works which
are done in real systems on

773
01:00:27,099 --> 01:00:31,510
investigating the security problems
security threats and she's going to

774
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:32,829
speak to college

775
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:39,579
hello my name is a volunteer you there
I'm a project manager and consulting in

776
01:00:39,579 --> 01:00:42,310
a defense analysis and penetration
testing

777
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:49,599
well i would like to say general things
a few gentle words about these words

778
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:52,900
everything that we see in this picture

779
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:57,400
maybe at some other guys don't see that
because there are working in a very

780
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:02,920
narrow field but in recent days we can
say that not everything is as bad as it

781
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:10,089
was previously security measures they
will move in the direction that it's not

782
01:01:10,089 --> 01:01:11,500
getting up

783
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:18,550
but it becomes it's even ahead of
fosters and we see some attempts of

784
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:24,460
products of which are preventive and
they prevent attacks and not following

785
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:26,890
the attacks yes they're not so common

786
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:31,868
they are not so widely introduced and
implemented but this is a good sign to

787
01:01:31,869 --> 01:01:32,530
all of us

788
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:37,359
it's a sign that someday we will have a
chance that attacks will not feel

789
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:39,120
yourself server

790
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:48,299
about plus a common question that would
like to verbalize we often are asked how

791
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:55,560
much it costs to attack us can you tell
us how much money should you have to

792
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:59,580
attack ask for example I speak about it

793
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:06,870
Fran stir it doesn't decide that he will
also talk a specific person

794
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:11,370
frost as they work in teams and teams
could look for no abilities everyone

795
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:13,529
there right exploits and then they apply
them

796
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:17,730
the team of criminals they don't work
for a specific line

797
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:23,280
more often they look on the basis of our
abilities and products where they can

798
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:28,350
find it and then they just search for
victims who use these particular

799
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:35,790
products and these and they attacked
them and your data will never be needed

800
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:41,490
to anybody but in fact that you use
known protected non-state version of a

801
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:45,899
certain software then you will have
broken your day will go to the black

802
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,430
market and back there

803
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:51,839
it can float for a long period of time
they can sell this data and then it can

804
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:58,170
be sold out the so your data can
disappear

805
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:03,990
free of charge just because you did have
this of vulnerable software you have to

806
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:10,140
be very careful to watch you use on your
devices and well it sounds very simple

807
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:14,100
you should follow the patches updates
and big great attention to that this is

808
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:18,660
a first of all it's related to
everything that you should take care of

809
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:26,040
well I'm ready to answer your general
equations if you have any we go

810
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:29,430
it is statistics but we can still
publish our statistical information on

811
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:33,899
our studies and those investigations
that will do so i think a lot of your

812
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:36,060
interest that you already have seen it

813
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:39,330
you can go and find it in our side

814
01:03:39,330 --> 01:03:43,980
ok let's release the trillion for the
next speaker do comics

815
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:47,790
you will be weighted in the whole you
will see everything and you can

816
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:50,310
communicate about their topical as the
equations

817
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:53,549
thank you very much have a good day and
these days

818
01:03:53,550 --> 01:03:54,300
thank you
