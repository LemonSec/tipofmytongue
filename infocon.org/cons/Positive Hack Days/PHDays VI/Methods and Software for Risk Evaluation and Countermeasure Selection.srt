1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I trusted you

2
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,280
my paws dog

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,590
in information security at st.
Petersburg e university and i will be

4
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:19,330
talking about risk assessments and
countermeasure selection there are three

5
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:24,070
stages do that process that is
identification if you like

6
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,669
benchmarking based on which you will
actually start risk mitigation

7
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:39,040
but alone has already been researched in
this area we propose a three-step

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,510
methodology here

9
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:45,430
identification and I was else's based
warmer

10
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:54,290
available protection and finally
mitigation a key characteristics of this

11
00:00:54,290 --> 00:01:02,420
approach includes assessment over your
assets events vulnerabilities threats

12
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:09,530
we also use the open standards of this
cap protocol for automated

13
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:16,400
representation of security data for risk
analysis we also use a multi-layer

14
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,920
hierarchical system that would
distinguish between different parameters

15
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,540
based on the amount of computing power
it needs for assessment

16
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:34,280
this approach also enables our stake
into account safe attempts or security

17
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:40,070
incidents shown here is the same system
that has been developed previously in

18
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:48,530
value my lab partners and their year
being partners essentially our system

19
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:55,910
but will collect related events from the
event analysis subsystem the objective

20
00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:02,179
of this research was to develop
implement and test risk assessment and

21
00:02:02,179 --> 00:02:05,179
countermeasures selection tools

22
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:14,130
so we wanted to achieve a more adequate
assessment of the current security

23
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:18,870
profile better selection of
countermeasures in line with existing

24
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,460
national standards based on the existing
standards

25
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,670
one can identify two different a risk
assessment methodologies to basic and a

26
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:37,070
detailed one and we can also be further
distinguish into static and dynamic

27
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:45,350
well the basic methodology is
exceedingly simple will be using CBS s

28
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:53,720
context assessments but we also sort of
adjusted by acid criticality and as a

29
00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:03,020
criticality will be a will be driven by
integrity and confidentiality in one

30
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,440
other factor sure

31
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:12,050
so then we have us we have a range of
scores from one to ten

32
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:25,640
Sean here is pretty much the same stuff
but in formulas so we will take away the

33
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,950
time parameters from the CBS s formula
if they are used and then start will

34
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:37,280
apply your criticality parameters the
detailed methodology shown here detailed

35
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:44,270
methodology is based on the traditional
understanding of risk as a multiple of

36
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:56,870
impact and probability and probability
is essentially based on air by evasion

37
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:07,310
at a graph that our algorithm is based
on three steps where we will s ass

38
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:13,910
the vulnerability of local horse based
on CBS s data for core nodes of the

39
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,358
graph will also look at access vectors

40
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,709
now we can all go home and this
assessment with a data on

41
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:28,760
burps historical data on successful
historical attacks and this will give us

42
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:34,849
conditional probability information and
full probability of graph notes

43
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,850
come from compromised

44
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:42,780
yeah

45
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,150
yeah

46
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,409
yeah

47
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:52,529
so for individual subjects a probability
of compromise will be recalculated

48
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:55,289
together with the calculation of risk

49
00:04:55,289 --> 00:04:59,519
we also take into account see analysis

50
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,869
sorry data coming from CM systems
reguarding reliability of the system

51
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:11,669
now if we see a particularly high risk
countermeasure selection algo will kick

52
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:19,019
into action for all the nodes that have
a high risk profile counter measures

53
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:21,209
will be a short listed

54
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:29,189
if a countermeasure sorry if several
countermeasures out will be applicable

55
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:34,469
to pretty much the same number of notes
of interest and we will actually

56
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:40,949
executed several lists will look at
costs and benefits comparison between

57
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:47,189
them in order to select the right list
of countermeasures for specific notes

58
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:52,079
shown here is the prototype architecture
so it shows input data sources of the

59
00:05:52,079 --> 00:06:03,360
data processing components that from
there like that the data will go into

60
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,089
the countermeasure selection component

61
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:12,179
now let me show the product of this
research and this is in fact a short

62
00:06:12,179 --> 00:06:13,589
simple example

63
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:17,789
so here we're assessing

64
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:24,240
network element of metrics of segment on
three counts as confidentially

65
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,510
criticality and availability

66
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:33,900
the initial at the graph is shown here
and shown in green are the notes

67
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:38,760
characterized by a low level of risk
after we process the incidence

68
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:53,469
she drops the subject now we have
developed a sequence of attacks are

69
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:58,630
based on that cap back templates because
uh we simply need to populate the

70
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:04,150
database as big as shown in think is the
particular sequence we analyzed so after

71
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:08,320
we adopted so to speak adapt to those
data

72
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:13,900
this is how the graph changed so after a
security incidents are processed

73
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:19,419
we obviously see that green turns into
yellow showing think are the incidents

74
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:27,760
currently being processed after the
first incident will see a substantial

75
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:34,030
number of knows that have changed and
they risk profile after the second

76
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,080
incident

77
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:41,620
we will see a particular node for which
the risk profile is different and this

78
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:47,170
is the big disadvantage of the proposed
method for this first subjects that have

79
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:50,170
loads of horse at the same level

80
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,948
we will see those changes in risk levels
for numerous hosted the same time so it

81
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:05,550
will be very difficult for us to predict
the sequence of future steps of the

82
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,550
attacker

83
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:16,190
yeah

84
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:21,200
now what can we do here first we can add
additional data additional

85
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:28,460
characteristics for example the nodes
that have changed their risk profile are

86
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:33,409
obviously part of the subset of at of
the notes that have really been attacked

87
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:43,218
so we can select countermeasures of the
subnet level now shown on top is a

88
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:47,570
sample of data to a sample counter
medicine will be proposed for the

89
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:59,690
compromise notes as shown below are
actually the shortlisted counter

90
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:05,060
measures that have the highest scores
such as temporarily blocking individual

91
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:10,160
nodes so within our prototype we
implemented several different methods of

92
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,110
risk assessments we tested them we
identified the air flows that we are

93
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:20,360
currently removing and will keep
focusing on expanding the functionality

94
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,660
of the system thank you very much that's
the end of my presentation

95
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,930
Thank any questions coming

96
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:31,910
sorry but AG

97
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:38,150
what kind of analysis you cheer on in
order to assess a probability of a

98
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:41,150
particular event is at the regression
analysis

99
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:49,810
I'm sorry couldn't find sure are usually
there are two sort of a component such

100
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,939
he will use for your analysis

101
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,590
that's the criticality of an SS price of
an asset and the probability of a

102
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,660
particular event

103
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,660
well as regards a so valia

104
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,500
now we are talking about business assets
right for business assets valuations

105
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:22,279
come from business so it's easing after
that we also need to assassinate Bela of

106
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:26,779
the technical assets that sort of
support the business s so this could be

107
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:30,439
software hardware for all of this we
will need to identify vulnerabilities

108
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:43,849
so essentially we start with a dollar
value but then we translated into

109
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:55,940
criticality score and then we assess a
local probabilities of being attacked

110
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:02,480
based on CSS index hello

111
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:06,520
it was slight sakes i believe

112
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:16,720
where you show that particular
assessment scale where you assigned one

113
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:25,250
- two probabilities that you couldn't
really very fight and the max level is

114
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,630
1.5 what's the logic for this is
actually see the SS scale this is not an

115
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:35,149
hour excerpt of scaling but the
logically therefore it is as follows

116
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:45,889
one serious ass combines data honor
exploitability and impact

117
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:51,139
who total the max he can get his 10 so
when they use this numbers in the

118
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:54,139
formula

119
00:11:57,319 --> 00:12:05,870
sorry if you scale it back if you go
from turn to the individual multipliers

120
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,589
you will get this range of 0.5 1 + 1.5

121
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:18,079
ok so you're basing it on CBS s but I'm
assuming you get have arbitrarily shows

122
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,989
in any other number rights

123
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:29,209
okay thank you

124
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:42,100
Thank You Lena so selection of
countermeasures will be driven or will

125
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,660
be made from a fixed exhaustively sore
can be updated and what about the

126
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,660
vulnerability of individual
countermeasures

127
00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:03,040
well so far no automated release of
countermeasure a delivery procedure has

128
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,839
been implemented but we understand the
rest standards for doing that there is a

129
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,820
scat protocol so i think we can develop
a remediation database it could be

130
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:20,770
linked directly to seee but currently we
assumed if companies want to use the

131
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:25,210
methodology they will be using admin
pre-approved lease of countermeasures

132
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:38,770
last question unless this one is very
sure that we can entertain another one

133
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:50,660
I don't get it correctly that the
assessment you make a base on attack

134
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,439
risk assumes it's a he

135
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:00,620
it's not a targeted attack because in
targeted attacks attackers usually try

136
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,220
to keep a low profile there they are
very stealthy

137
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:13,460
so there they will use social
engineering for example or they will try

138
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:18,440
to exploit low rank vulnerabilities so
that they are not seen

139
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:28,940
that's right we are no really taking
into account targeted tax here but we do

140
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:35,600
take into account the difficulty of
accessing a particular vulnerability so

141
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,900
that should sort of partially compensate
for it but CB says doesn't really

142
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:51,380
reflect this difficulty or complexity
say in css3 it's not really reflective

143
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:57,020
what CBS s Luke's are these are all
weather all the preconditions for

144
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:01,430
mounting an attack are controllable so
it has been combined the attacker or not

145
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,109
you agree with that

146
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,110
this will be the last question

147
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,939
well indeed some of the solutions have
been talking about have previously been

148
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:24,699
implemented within the massive or air a
project and we understand that they've

149
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:27,099
actually been implemented in open source

150
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:34,870
siem system called open world now do you
think that's the reason demand for this

151
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:43,180
sort of the research has has there been
any in interest for what you're doing

152
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,680
from siem developers have you tried
pitching your methodology - well

153
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,269
obviously we wouldn't do this research
if we thought there would be no demand

154
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:55,269
for it

155
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:06,680
I'm aggregate enka I did speak in the
previous phd's and I spoke about massive

156
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:13,160
array technology important thing to
remember is that you shouldn't really

157
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,870
assess it only the level of our lab
because work with 12 different partners

158
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:22,250
from different countries and we're all
developing the system in the different

159
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:27,230
areas there are several prototypes of s
I am systems developed by a number of

160
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:31,279
organizations well we are developing our
prototypes for example for cyber

161
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,279
physical systems

162
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,230
yeah

163
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,890
so if you're interested we shall be
happy to discuss it with you

164
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,569
thank you
