1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,380
the original trauma kalia and me as I
would bobbin of Alexandria have to study

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,920
a companion Alex undergo water from the
phone company

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,450
responsible for the certification of the
data protection solutions and we

4
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:29,430
and free time I also teach in the Moscow
technical university after Baumann

5
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,668
I teach information security

6
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:36,040
would love to explain the project that i
was in the room

7
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:41,860
and which is related to the development
of the national standard the russian

8
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:47,019
federation in the vault plate and accept
cept where

9
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,670
those of your ford truck down the trans
and

10
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,790
national certification system may point
out that over the last couple of years

11
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:04,069
the national certification systems have
become

12
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,590
you're practically oriented so they're
much more oriented to practical safety

13
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:16,950
and such activities like vulnerabilities
analysis is mandatory

14
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:25,740
when doing such certification test will
select a point all that the requirements

15
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,899
testing labs

16
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:39,890
actually in meet the international
standards that I used by the foreign

17
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:43,520
labs and the forest certification
systems

18
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:51,380
so cold

19
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,470
stuff to have honor abilities database

20
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:03,490
they're so used on the requirements are
provided to them information protection

21
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,670
which is related to

22
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:16,940
not only getting the certificate with
also supporting this certificate by

23
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:23,720
releasing the update also like to point
out that there may be some protective

24
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,180
measures here

25
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:37,310
I want to create the secretary with
minimal number of vulnerabilities

26
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,260
but unfortunately

27
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,510
it has not been defined in

28
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:56,450
big number we know the the needs of the
the actual needs for the implementation

29
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:05,239
if there is activities related to the
safe cetera so the regulator wanted to

30
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:17,870
have some research and as a result a
national standard was created a with the

31
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,890
name given at the scream

32
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:24,220
the development of the safe - safe
software

33
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:34,000
the standard was developed the first
time to protect the interest of the

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:43,480
regulator to protect information so when
the documentation was developed the

35
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:52,450
specifics was taken into account the
document would stipulate the best

36
00:03:52,450 --> 00:04:00,310
practices that are to create the safe
software this document should also be

37
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:08,740
compatible with the standard criteria
standard de facto

38
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:15,329
it's used as a basis for all the
national education system

39
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,829
this document

40
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:24,840
should be oriented to the developers of
the protection solutions and they're so

41
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,229
the

42
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:34,840
also those who could confirm that in the
organization best practices are actively

43
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:40,359
used on the slider

44
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,720
i'm showing you

45
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:50,530
the stages of the project started
working on its in april 2013

46
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,150
would test it the document

47
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,810
you

48
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:08,350
I made until September in 2014 2015

49
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:19,039
there were public listenings in the 360
to committee

50
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,750
which is about data protection

51
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:30,830
I'd like to point out that the starting
from april until September 2015

52
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,040
when the listenings were favored

53
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,049
the seventh version of the document was
adopted

54
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,230
and they received it

55
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,360
from kaspersky lab

56
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,780
how's it different things

57
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,780
general was taken into account

58
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,080
the current status of the document

59
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:19,690
all the formal procedures were passed
and country

60
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:27,219
the document is going to ross standard
procedures so we expected and june and

61
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,440
july nine

62
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:37,340
it will be confirmed the main part of
the document the national standard

63
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:45,409
document is made up of the safe software
development requirements we need to

64
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:51,020
point out that we're not reinventing any
wheel here

65
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:58,740
and the measures that are reflected in
the current version of your document

66
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:06,119
have been stipulated through the
analysis of different standards and

67
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:09,119
methods

68
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:18,930
and they have been developed by both
Western and Russian organizations

69
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,349
there are see a bank

70
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:29,099
free for example that's the standard for
the safe use of software

71
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,520
first simpler solution

72
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,950
each of them end of the measure

73
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:51,500
were compared with the standard life
cycle procedures

74
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,740
it's a standard

75
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,200
describing

76
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:02,469
various processes that can be related to
the implementation of the software we

77
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:13,270
need to point out that neither concrete
model of the software development is

78
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,460
declared

79
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,460
speaking in terms of

80
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:25,810
the software implementation i would like
to point out that in these four

81
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,810
processes

82
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,309
with a few vulnerabilities we offer

83
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,179
thank you

84
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:49,290
such processes as threats modeling the
use of static analysis of threats and

85
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,900
texture

86
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,980
apart from functional testing

87
00:08:53,980 --> 00:09:01,269
we recommend the use of different
activities to analyze the penetration

88
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:04,269
with dynamic analysis of cold

89
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:12,800
and application testing apart from the
main processes we have some additional

90
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:20,569
ones supported processes there is
processes related to the organization

91
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,600
matters

92
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,600
the document offers

93
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:31,980
additional measures for training

94
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:41,400
the search of the vulnerabilities and
managing the configuration to provide

95
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,400
protection from the

96
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,800
access

97
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,630
unauthorized axis

98
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,810
so for a few life cycle

99
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,040
I

100
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:02,130
solutions the document stipulates the
number of measures

101
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:12,149
it also identify the goals and the
results of the safe software

102
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,140
for each measure they have requirements
for its implementation would like to

103
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,050
point out the

104
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:26,839
such measures are not only related to
the developers so that the developers

105
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:33,410
need to implement these so that static
analysis we also have requirements

106
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,480
to the developer

107
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,480
that they need to use through different
activities

108
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:47,610
so is to be used to confirm

109
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,410
the processes of the developer

110
00:10:54,780 --> 00:11:01,020
i would like to show you the how this
project is really related to those

111
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,230
documents

112
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,230
that are already there in the ecosystem

113
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:12,290
and somehow related to be saved

114
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:21,050
software development it can be used as a
source for additional measures for the

115
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:24,050
protected software

116
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,880
it can be used to

117
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:32,529
or trusted criteria and so forth

118
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,360
i would like to point out that

119
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:43,490
at this document

120
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,490
is the first

121
00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:50,069
part of work which is done

122
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:55,260
by the ecosystem

123
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,470
you

124
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,290
there will be document released

125
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:09,649
which will be disclosed and some of the
end

126
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:12,819
items of international standard

127
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:15,819
so the description is given at a very
high level

128
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:20,459
I'm done thank you very much questions
please sir

129
00:12:21,629 --> 00:12:25,619
first

130
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
security at the the community which it

131
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,138
was the target audience

132
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:40,139
these documents

133
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:47,170
those would like to be contractor so I
also think that this document will be

134
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:53,290
used by the independent developers to
ensure the safety of the products

135
00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:02,660
doesn't contain and recommendations of
how to implement these practices

136
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:12,680
how to implement these practices and the
most painless way this

137
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,680
the main target audience

138
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:25,239
as the developers of the software those
who would like to certify those would

139
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,240
like to set aside

140
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:35,199
it would be nice if this document was
used by the developers

141
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:44,449
answer your last question i would like
to point out that such recommendations

142
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:49,789
for the implementations are not
reflected here

143
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:52,789
so most likely

144
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,599
it will be reflected in some other
documents

145
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,030
can read it somewhere

146
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:19,150
yes you can contact me by this
electronic mail

147
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:25,180
I can send you the cop but this will not
be the version published by our standard

148
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:32,170
there was something related to the
vulnerabilities search costs

149
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,979
yes there is a longer ability related
ghost justification

150
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,410
as far as i know

151
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:49,339
it's a still publicly announced and is
now by the different developer

152
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:54,230
it will take some time year said well
thank you

153
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,880
I saw some software for vulnerability
analysis

154
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,680
ap chicken it's called

155
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,680
which is used

156
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,620
usually uses a vast is that true but

157
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:28,949
I'm not quite competent answering this
question because I mainly about

158
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:32,880
certification here in nationala we have
developers where

159
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:39,450
City Engineer but if his sights states
that it checks that most likely it's

160
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:42,450
true

161
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,850
unfortunately I cannot speak more about
up checker

162
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,120
thank you

163
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,120
don't have time just one final question

164
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:05,330
very good question about the mandatory
fees datos of those who would like to

165
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,810
license license will really be mandatory

166
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:16,810
as far as the

167
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:21,420
document is concerned first to all it
will have some recommendation

168
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:26,689
and this was the requirements from data
protection are concerned

169
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:34,279
one of the requirements is that the
organization should use some activities

170
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:37,759
to provide the safe use of them

171
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:44,930
software so it does not really have this
mandatory requirements to stipulate it

172
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:50,420
says the word will be nice that if you
started using this safe software seems

173
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:57,949
like it's going to be a recommended for
a while and after some time in two years

174
00:16:57,949 --> 00:17:00,589
it will become mandatory

175
00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:03,649
that's what I know

176
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:07,459
thank you

177
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,460
our final question you spoke about the
need of the static analysis

178
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:24,849
the analysis of the vulnerabilities
during the development as far as i know

179
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:30,969
the static analysis is the control of up
possibilities

180
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:34,330
does it really say that the
certification issues

181
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,950
you

182
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:44,650
become the confidence of the developer
if not why should the developers should

183
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,570
do the entity on its own

184
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:53,679
the static analysis of called the two
referring to in the document is wider

185
00:17:55,299 --> 00:18:00,249
then this search the document dates back
to nineteen ninety nine

186
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:06,300
target audience our developers and the
document is too

187
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:16,610
encourage the developers to use good
activities to create software with

188
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:19,979
minimal number of vulnerabilities

189
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,309
as far as the certification

190
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:28,860
for this kind of your mansion is
concerned it so not really so

191
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,600
as for the static analysis and
vulnerabilities and

192
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:39,900
the other method supply certain
abilities the time required

193
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,260
for the developers to do on the

194
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,440
so that they have say
