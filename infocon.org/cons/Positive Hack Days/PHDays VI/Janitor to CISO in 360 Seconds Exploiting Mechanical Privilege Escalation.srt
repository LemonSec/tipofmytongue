1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
we're waiting for one

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:10,620
you have the power to make this go
faster if you have one

3
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,220
actually is

4
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,770
yeah

5
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,200
yeah

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,200
Oh

7
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,960
cool

8
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,960
let's see here and what's going on

9
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:04,579
yeah

10
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,570
yeah

11
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,570
yeah

12
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,180
well now I feel bad that he was looking
for an adapter that we don't need

13
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,180
anymore

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,360
yeah

15
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,360
yeah

16
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,250
yeah

17
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,180
is there any other staff from ph days
here at the moment are ready to go or

18
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,190
should we wait

19
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:59,840
mmm start up online are ready to go

20
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,140
yeah all right good good afternoon
everyone

21
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:09,080
so this is a talk about an interesting
topic

22
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:17,630
I call it janitor to see so and 30 60
seconds which is about six minutes and

23
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:22,579
we will be discussing a very interesting
attack against mechanical pin tumbler

24
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:30,140
locks so before we begin let me talk a
little bit about Who I am so I am

25
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:36,559
associated with tool tool is a
lock-picking organization founded in the

26
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,770
netherlands in 2002

27
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:45,200
i am the president and co-founder of the
United States division of tool we

28
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,480
currently have over 21 chapters in north
america and the organization does a

29
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,950
number of things including public
education running lock-picking villages

30
00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:01,429
and workshops like the one that is here
at ph days and principally the

31
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,430
organization serves a combination of
both

32
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:11,269
hobbyists and professionals so we have
you know many competitions all over the

33
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:18,739
world and meetings often concentrating
only on picking locks for fun because it

34
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:19,579
is fun

35
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:27,769
professionally I have a work with a pen
testing firm that I found it

36
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:31,670
we've also been around for around ten
years and we focus on education

37
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:38,268
independent research we do some reverse
engineering work and principally most of

38
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:43,760
our work is with red tubing or live
engagements and some risk management

39
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,828
stuff so we like to sometimes say that
you know security consultant by day

40
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,829
criminal consultant by night

41
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:58,000
but that's my background so let's talk
about some locks and wire wire locks

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,660
important

43
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,670
why do they matter well the reason locks
matter even in the information security

44
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:10,209
world is that if you can touch it you
own it right

45
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:15,130
if if I can physically get to your
hardware to your firewall to your

46
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:15,940
servers

47
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,180
we got it working thank you and that's
all right then

48
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:25,419
then there's a problem and so the
physical security is just as important

49
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:33,400
if not more important than the
cybersecurity and so oftentimes all of

50
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:39,099
the hard work that you put in at the
data center can be undone by using the

51
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,810
wrong locks that were purchased from a
hardware store and locks also serve

52
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,830
another interesting function that is
important to remember which is to say

53
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:55,510
that locks function as seals that are
evidence of tampering one of the before

54
00:04:55,510 --> 00:05:03,460
we had easy ways of locking up our
personal belongings sailors at sea would

55
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:08,289
often use special knots in order to
detect if someone has been in their bag

56
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:13,360
so if anyone in in here is familiar with
knots

57
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,740
there are some different names for them
in the US this is something we call a

58
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:29,590
reef knot and it's a very common not
used very often on boats and many years

59
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:35,409
ago sailors used to use something called
a thief not which looks very similar to

60
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:40,390
a reef knot but takes a very special way
to tie it

61
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:45,820
and the reason for that is is at the
time thieves would look at the knot of

62
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,270
the bag before they opened it memorized
it

63
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,539
look in the bag to see if there was
anything interesting

64
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:58,090
and then try to tie it again with the
same not to delay the amount of time

65
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:03,940
that it took before they were detected
and so the thief not because it looks

66
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,940
like a reef knot

67
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,980
if the sailor came back and saw that oh
it's been tied incorrectly then they

68
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,480
knew someone was in here and locks serve
the same function as well

69
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,220
the purpose of the lock is not only to
prevent access but to tell you that

70
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,480
someone was there

71
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:26,750
if you walk into your office and the
door is missing or there's a big hole in

72
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,470
the wall

73
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:32,510
you know there's a problem and if
there's a hole in the wall and nothing

74
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,650
was stolen

75
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:41,390
you know there's a big problem but if
you walk in and everything is normal and

76
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,650
there's nothing broken

77
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:46,880
then how do you know if someone was
there or not and this is the problem

78
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,820
with locks that can be manipulated so
today we're not going to focus on lock

79
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,330
picking but in order for you to
understand the exploit that we're going

80
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:00,380
to talk about you need to also
understand lock-picking so i will give

81
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,710
you a very brief overview of how
lock-picking works

82
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:09,469
the most common type of lock cylinder in
the world is the pin tumbler lock

83
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:14,510
they come in a variety of shapes and
sizes and they all look very similar

84
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,950
from the outside

85
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:19,190
who in this room has seen this type of
lock before it should be

86
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:25,850
everyone perfect from the outside they
all look very much the same and we can

87
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:30,290
use some terms to define the different
parts of the lock

88
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:36,950
we have the housing or the shell inside
that we have the plug

89
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:42,409
this is part of the lock that turns
inside of the plug we have the key way

90
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:46,880
this is the hole that you insert the key
and the key way usually has some sort of

91
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,810
shape and the shape is referred to as
the warning

92
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:59,710
so again here's the outer view and if we
were to look inside the lock this is

93
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:06,370
what we would see we would see a keep in
a driver pin and we can see that these

94
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:10,900
two work together to keep the lock
closed and normally from the outside you

95
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,780
can only see the key pin

96
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:18,520
so again normally you don't see the
driver pins you only normally see

97
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,659
they keep in and of course there's a
spring but this much is obvious

98
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:28,780
so without a key does the lock turn know
why not

99
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:33,459
the driver pin is blocking the rotation
and it doesn't matter if the lock is

100
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:37,960
installed this way or this way they work
the same way

101
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:43,540
in the u.s. we often install our locks
like this in Europe often like this i

102
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:48,339
don't know what's common in Russia like
this or like this like this first one

103
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:52,000
first one yeah pretty much everywhere in
the world

104
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,360
it's like this but it works the same way
no matter what

105
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,360
and of course when you insert your key
the pin is raised to the shear line and

106
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,260
the lock is open and in a real lock
there is a not only one pin there is

107
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:12,160
five or six maybe seven pins and so when
the key is inserted each one of those

108
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,620
key pins must be raised to the proper
height in order to allow for the lock to

109
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,740
open and if even one pin is too low

110
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:24,910
like you see there or - hi

111
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:32,110
the lock doesn't open it must be just
right and you can also notice that the

112
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,540
points the sharp parts on the key

113
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:39,579
don't matter the only thing on the key
that matters is the part that the pin

114
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,350
rests on and if you've never seen the
inside of a lock this is not very

115
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,340
obvious

116
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:51,910
this is also why sometimes if a lock key
has if the key has trouble working in a

117
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:56,920
lock if it's been copied many times why
sometimes you can wiggle it back and

118
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,920
forth and you can make it work

119
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,400
not really directly related but
interesting and movies we see people

120
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:12,030
shooting locks a lot so we shot some
locks and interestingly enough even

121
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:17,339
though we put holes through the locks
the shackles remain closed and it's

122
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:21,150
important to keep in mind that lock
cylinders are part of a system of

123
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:26,310
components and the cylinder is not the
only component of a lock even if the

124
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:31,410
cylinder is missing you can see that the
lock can still remain closed but we're

125
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,089
not going to talk about that today

126
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:38,820
so in a perfect world normally when you
apply any kind of pressure to lock all

127
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:45,300
of the pins are blocking the rotation
equally but in the real world there are

128
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:52,469
manufacturing defects and problems in
the lock in the pins that result in

129
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,240
issues with tolerances

130
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,580
does anyone see anything wrong with this
lock that's correct

131
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,960
it's not a straight line you can see
that some of the pin chambers on the

132
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,920
left hand side are not perfectly aligned
and this causes a problem in the lock

133
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:14,700
so when you apply turning pressure the
pressure is applied unevenly and this

134
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,680
allows you to manipulate the lock

135
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,300
so again on the left you can see a
perfect lock which does not exist and on

136
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:28,859
the right you see a exaggerated version
of a realistic lock and so this is how

137
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,430
lock-picking works when you apply
pressure you're able to raise the pen to

138
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:38,849
the proper height the plug turns a
little bit and now you can set multiple

139
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,630
pins and if you are interested in
learning more about lock-picking i

140
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:47,790
encourage you to come to our workshops
tomorrow and you

141
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,329
you can practice this yourself but today
we're going to talk about something

142
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,260
different

143
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:59,970
we're going to talk about master key
systems and these are systems where you

144
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,680
have large buildings or schools or
institutions where there's several

145
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,069
hundred or maybe several thousand lock
cylinders

146
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:15,300
and there are some people that can that
have keys they only open some doors and

147
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,589
then there are some people that might
have a master key or a top-level key

148
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:22,980
that opens all the doors

149
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,210
has anyone here seen a system like this
in use before where you have one key

150
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:32,310
that opens multiple rows so some it's
not as popular in different parts of the

151
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:36,540
world but what's interesting is that in
addition to

152
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:40,470
ok so we're going to say this right now
if you have a cell phone please put it

153
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:45,840
on silent right now if you have a cell
phone and it's not on silent please put

154
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,860
it on silent

155
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:55,830
thank you so master key systems offer a
couple of different advantages and

156
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:59,490
they're also vulnerable to the type of
attack that will discuss

157
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:03,690
so how does the master key system work
instead of only having two pins in a

158
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:10,650
chamber you have multiple pins so as the
key is inserted key cuts of different

159
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,350
heights can open the same lock

160
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:18,780
so in this example you can see that
we've replaced the number 8 pin with the

161
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:24,689
number 6 pin and a number to pin and
what this means is that a key in that

162
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:30,660
position can open the lock either with
the number 6 cut or with a number 8 cut

163
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:37,350
does this make sense yeah it's a very
simple concept and using this using this

164
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,880
idea

165
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,390
you can make very large and complicated
master key systems

166
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:46,829
so you can have individual keys that
open the locks and then you can also

167
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:53,970
have high-level keys that open multiple
locks so let's take a look at an example

168
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:57,090
system so here's four keys

169
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:04,680
we have Alice Andy Bob and janitor and
each one of their keys has a different

170
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,270
code a different building and this is
the code of the key that operates the

171
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,020
lock

172
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:17,579
each one of those locks is also a little
bit different so you can see here is

173
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,080
Alice's key

174
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:27,100
her key works in her lock in the upper
left-hand corner but it does not work in

175
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,860
Andy's lock or in Bob's lock

176
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:37,450
Andy's key works in his lock in the
upper right hand corner but it doesn't

177
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,970
work in either of the other locks

178
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:43,780
Bob's key same thing

179
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:48,970
lower left hand corner Bob's key works
in his own door but it will not open any

180
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:49,930
other doors

181
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:56,319
now you have the janitors key and you
can see the janitor can open two of the

182
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,560
doors but not the third door

183
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:05,859
because that's not a door that he's
supposed to have access to and about

184
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:12,400
some time in 2003 a colleague of ours
mad blaze published an academic paper

185
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:19,930
about using optimized attacks to decode
the top level master key and it received

186
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:24,849
at the time a great deal of attention
from locksmiths he even received death

187
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:29,710
threats for publishing this very simple
paper and it was news for a couple years

188
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,390
and then it was quickly forgotten

189
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:37,900
and what's interesting to us is even
today 13 years later we still see the

190
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:43,810
same problem and all sorts of systems
all over the world and what's

191
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:49,030
interesting about this attack is if you
compare the cylinder parts - how

192
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:55,660
cryptography works you can think of the
cylinder as an oracle think about what

193
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:59,530
does the Oracle check what does the
cylinder check when you insert the key

194
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:07,000
it checks the key bidding and how does
the cylinder respond to the key it

195
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,200
either opens or it doesn't open so it
gives you feedback is the key correct or

196
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,670
is the key incorrect

197
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:17,290
now using what we know about locks how
can we extract information from the

198
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:21,339
Oracle how going to get the Oracle to
leak secrets to us

199
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,440
well let's take a look at that

200
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,900
so here is Alice's key this is a lock
that she can access this is her own door

201
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:35,449
so the bidding her bidding is 36 - 35

202
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:42,050
obviously it works in her lock we don't
know what's inside the lock but we know

203
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,189
for sure

204
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:48,980
at the very least all of the driver pins
must be at the edge of the plug

205
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:55,160
so at the very least we must we know
that this is correct but if the system

206
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,180
is master keyed we also know that there
are other pins in the lock we just don't

207
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:05,179
know where these details are hidden to
us because we cannot see inside the lock

208
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:11,420
so what do we do well we can attack the
lock pin by pin because the pins don't

209
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,589
talk to each other

210
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:17,419
so what we will do is we will first take
some blanks and we're going to copy

211
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:25,400
Alice's key except in the first position
we're going to leave it 0 uncut and on

212
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,820
all of the other positions we are going
to use the cuts that we already know

213
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,899
from her key

214
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:35,330
what we're going to do is we're going to
sweep through this range

215
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:40,490
we're going to only concentrate on one
kit bit position at a time and move

216
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,290
through it and check at each time

217
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:45,980
so here's the first key we file it away

218
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:53,330
we put it in the Oracle the Oracle says
no the key does not open so we know that

219
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:58,669
the one position is incorrect and we
keep going we try the number two if

220
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,440
you're filing by hand

221
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,840
your cuts might look different but
remember the only thing that matters is

222
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:12,230
the lowest point where it touches the
key so we try the key again the lock

223
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,320
doesn't open so we try it again

224
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,629
we go down to three so what's going to
happen is going to open

225
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:28,130
yes why it's the same key exactly we
already knew that this was the correct

226
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,770
beating that the correct bidding sorry

227
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:35,629
and we've now duplicated that however
we've learned something we've learned

228
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,560
that at the very least

229
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:43,740
this pin is solid there might be more
pins above it but we know for sure that

230
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,740
this pin is solid so we have to continue
exploring

231
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:52,469
so we filed down one more position we
try the key and find that it doesn't

232
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,850
work we keep going

233
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:57,840
try number five try it again doesn't
work

234
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:03,570
keep going remove the key file it down
to number six tried in the lock open

235
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:07,350
now what have we learned in this example
lock

236
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:14,820
we have learned that there is another
pin and we have learned the height of

237
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:21,030
that pin so without opening up the lock
we've discovered this other in height

238
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:27,690
now we know this one and we can repeat
the same process for the rest of the

239
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:28,500
pins

240
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,210
there is a chance that there are more
sheer lines so if we want we can

241
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:38,640
continue exploring to number seven and
try it but in this case in this example

242
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,840
it did not work so we know in the first
position there is only a three and a six

243
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:50,909
and you can do this for any position now
in this example lock we're using a quick

244
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:54,060
set brand lock it's an American lock
that you'll never see here thankfully

245
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,200
it's terrible

246
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,230
there are only seven positions / chamber

247
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:07,260
so we don't have to go past seven so now
we're going to prepare a second key and

248
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:12,930
we use the six position in the first
part of the key because that's what

249
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:18,120
we've already learned in the second
position we put in 20 and the rest we

250
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:24,689
put in from the original key 0 deaths
with no cut are very rare

251
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,290
they're not used very often so if you're
trying to save time

252
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:32,070
you don't have to check 0 but it also
doesn't cost you a lot of time to check

253
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:37,679
0 so in this example we'll start at the
number one depth we try it

254
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:44,630
lock doesn't open file it down to number
two we try it in the lock

255
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:48,050
still doesn't open and we keep going

256
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:51,830
we're at three try it again lock doesn't
open

257
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,360
keep going try the key open

258
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,360
what have we learned now about this
position

259
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:04,760
well we know our it's the number that we
learned is different from our original

260
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,930
key

261
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:10,250
so we've now discovered the other master
pin in this chamber

262
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:18,919
now again we don't know about these but
we probably have all the information

263
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:24,920
from there because now we have a shear
line here and this year line below it

264
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:32,210
because we know all the other positions
from our original key

265
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:39,440
so now we're basically done with
position to Y in practice single pins

266
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,960
are very rare

267
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,530
they cause problems in the lock if the
pin is too thin

268
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:50,120
so you can usually in most systems if
you're performing this attack you can

269
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,379
skip numbers

270
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:55,910
you don't have to try each consecutive
number once you reach a successful

271
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:56,810
position

272
00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:01,580
so because of that reason a five depth
is unlikely

273
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:10,159
so we could try a set number 6 and that
would work but we know that because we

274
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,270
knew that from before

275
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:15,230
what about seven should we try number
seven

276
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:19,190
no one was in it

277
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:24,500
yeah exactly we wouldn't want to try
number seven because it would be a a

278
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:29,960
single position pin and this would be
very rare in the lock so

279
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,710
and since kwikset locks in this example
don't go past number seven

280
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:38,510
we don't have to keep going so now we
prepare a third key which cut will be in

281
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:41,540
the first position six

282
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:48,409
yep second position for third position 0

283
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:52,220
we have some people listening and for
the rest of the key do you remember you

284
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:52,670
may not

285
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,630
it's okay

286
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:58,970
three and five very good so now we
explore this position and as you can see

287
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,980
through this process

288
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,960
it's very very simple this is not
complicated and this is also something

289
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:13,130
that you can do without arises arousing
any suspicion because you're not picking

290
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,030
the lock

291
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:17,899
you're not using any tools all you're
doing is you're inserting a key into the

292
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:23,540
lock and seeing if it opens someone
watching you even on a camera will only

293
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:27,950
see you inserting the lock and trying to
open it and you can pretend that you

294
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,210
wrote the wrong door

295
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:33,110
or maybe you have access to that door
maybe it's your office

296
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:37,699
you can do this on your own door without
touching any other doors and discover

297
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,920
information about the rest of the system

298
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,840
so should we try number one or three

299
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:49,639
well no because we know that our
original key was to and we know that

300
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,320
single positions are very rare so we can
optimize our attack and we can jump

301
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,550
right to number four

302
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:59,870
so our third key is prepared

303
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:05,570
we try it it doesn't turn we keep going
we try it again and open

304
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:12,260
so what does that tell us well it tells
us quite a bit now we've learned even

305
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,330
more information about the lock

306
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:21,169
we don't have any news yet about the
final two positions but otherwise we

307
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:23,390
think we probably have the third
position

308
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:28,370
do we need to explore number six or
number seven

309
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:31,370
no why

310
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:40,389
seven maybe sure if you're not sure you
can check but if you know that there's

311
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:45,220
going to be if only one position if it's
not a very large system

312
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,820
you don't really have to keep going once
you've discovered are already one of the

313
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,320
deaths

314
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,320
so now we prepare a fourth key

315
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:59,469
645 we put in 0 for our cut but in five
four the last cut because we already

316
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,790
know that from before

317
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:08,530
and why are we skipping 0 1 and 2 and
going directly to three

318
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:16,180
well we're not we're actually not sorry
I apologize

319
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:20,080
you called me we're going to test one

320
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,490
we know three was our original height so
we're only going to test one

321
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,830
then we're going to test five six and
seven so we go to one we try it doesn't

322
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:32,050
work we go two three

323
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:35,260
we know that that works because that's
our key from before

324
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:44,530
obviously so we try five doesn't work we
try six still doesn't work and we try

325
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:47,530
the last one and it still doesn't work

326
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:54,310
what does that tell us there's no master
pins in that position to position for is

327
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:59,440
not mastered now we've decoded four out
of the five pins and so now we prepare

328
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,300
our very last key

329
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:07,419
so now the fifth position is free to be
explored

330
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:12,550
we could try 0 or 1

331
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:16,360
so we'll try number one and it works

332
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:23,439
so what have we probably discovered at
this point there's a very strong chance

333
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,060
that we've probably discovered the
master key for that system

334
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:35,530
what's the easiest way to check if that
key works just start trying it indoors

335
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:39,639
yeah walk around a different doors try
it and see if it works

336
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,860
that is all you need to do to decode a
master key system

337
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:49,959
it's possible that there could be
another cut here and maybe there's some

338
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:55,510
other cuts here but if you just start
trying it in different doors then that

339
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:58,570
could be all that's necessary in order
for it to work

340
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:02,439
now if you've done it with a machine
your key will look something like this

341
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,129
if you've done it by hand

342
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:10,480
your key might look something like this
if you've done it by hand poorly

343
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,809
it might look something like this might
get stuck in the lock

344
00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:18,700
so be careful you don't do that but
let's take a look at our original locks

345
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,419
again

346
00:27:19,419 --> 00:27:25,870
so here's our original lock and you can
see the master pin depths as well

347
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:32,290
here is an ultimate lock in the same
system a new lock a different lock this

348
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:36,700
part of the same master key system are
decoded master key would work there as

349
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:44,530
well and this is an attack that took you
what 20 minutes to learn how much time

350
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:49,899
do you think it will take to work
through all these keys if you have them

351
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:54,100
prepared in advance at most

352
00:27:54,100 --> 00:28:00,070
if you want to do all the cutting and
you're counting the amount of time that

353
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:04,899
it takes to cut short but what's
interesting about this is you can

354
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:10,090
prepare all of your attack keys in
advance if you have your working key

355
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:14,918
already that you're going to use you
don't have to go back to your key

356
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:16,690
machine between each test

357
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:22,000
you already know all of the possible
keys you're going to use and key blanks

358
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,140
are very cheap

359
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:28,120
they cost you know in 10-20 us cents

360
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:33,250
so you can buy 20 30 keys however many
you need

361
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:38,110
and prepare all of your exploratory keys
in advance and you can go through all of

362
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,969
these keys very very quickly

363
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:45,640
now with this attack is there any
evidence left in the lock

364
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:51,970
no normally with lock picking this
forensic evidence left in the lock

365
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:56,110
scratches here and there with other
techniques there's always forensic

366
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,669
evidence left behind

367
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:01,750
with this particular technique there is
no forensic evidence left behind because

368
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:10,000
all you are inserting into the lock is a
key if you perform this attack

369
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,560
do you think it's easy to detect for
others know

370
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:19,960
so what do you do if you have a master
key system

371
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:23,590
well you could just not use master King

372
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,399
but master King provides a level of
convenience that a lot of customers

373
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,270
enjoy

374
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:33,370
if you have to use master King I would
maybe recommend that you take your

375
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:41,080
important assets such as server rooms
wiring closets laboratories and don't

376
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,300
make it part of the master key system

377
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:47,320
there's no reason that every door has to
be master keyed

378
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,840
it's ok for whoever is important enough
to have access to everything

379
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:59,199
it is ok for them to carry one extra key
to extra keys or alternatively you can

380
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:05,020
use systems from different companies
that combine mechanical elements with

381
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:10,090
electronic elements such as you know the
AUSA click this is a lock cylinder that

382
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:13,840
uses a combination of a cryptographic
electronic token

383
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,230
in addition to high security mechanical
elements

384
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:25,870
that's basically it this is something
that even though it's a very simple

385
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:28,870
attack and even though it's an older
attack

386
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:34,600
we have run time and time again and to
clients that have never heard of this

387
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:42,370
has anyone heard of this attack before
today no is it kind of a scary attack if

388
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:44,080
you have a master key system

389
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,080
yeah sure absolutely

390
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,379
so that's the basic idea we have some
time for Q&A

391
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,680
I have a lot more content if anyone has
any specific questions about a topic i

392
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,820
think we have a good amount of extra
time so I'd be happy to switch to that

393
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,300
as well and that's what i have about
master King

394
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,480
so thank you for that does anyone have
any questions

395
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:26,690
yes in the back so have microphone
moving to the back and we have a

396
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:31,580
question here you guys

397
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:40,159
if i if i understand correctly you are
taking a visual rider key on your trying

398
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,570
on your own office

399
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:45,350
correct on your try each pin one of
those Rosa

400
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:50,510
but this this prison this assumes that
as a master keys

401
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:58,129
totally opposite from the regular key on
what happens if the master key is a part

402
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:01,430
of regular key on but of x star

403
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:04,520
can you guess at this time this

404
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:09,800
I don't know if I'm here ask me the
question once more i'm very sorry

405
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:16,159
ok to perform this attack you take a key
your key or get lucky

406
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:21,620
no you put it in the pin on the one of
the world's are you are getting the

407
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:26,120
missing but there's your tracking it
yeah it's great . one by one that's

408
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:31,310
correct one but one but and then you
eventually

409
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:37,940
fine every but it doesn't belong to the
urgent okie correct

410
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:44,120
so you are assumes that the master key
is only constituted by the opposite

411
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,909
about your is fine

412
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:53,420
cry on if it's only a combination of
your key on the extra pins you found

413
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,610
those are a lot of possibilities

414
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:58,649
ah yes I understand now so what you are
saying

415
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:05,700
is that in this example we are assuming
that any in-depth that we find that is

416
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:12,180
not part of our original key is part of
the master key yet if the system is a

417
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:17,370
smaller master key system then this will
almost always be true if it is a system

418
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,260
that uses multiple keys

419
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:23,160
so if it looks closer to let's see here
one moment

420
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:32,490
so for example if you have multiple
levels

421
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:36,660
yes intermediate 1 if you have
intermediate levels yes then you will

422
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:42,270
discover possibly multiple master key
depths and then you will have a

423
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:46,950
situation where you might accidentally
discover one of the intermediate Curie's

424
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:53,160
and you will have to do some more
testing and more exploring to figure out

425
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,600
the actual master key

426
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,810
so what would happen is if I am in this
system

427
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:03,240
i'm guessing which which cuts are the
master pins

428
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:08,100
so what will happen is i will start
trying it on doors and it will work on

429
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:12,179
you know maybe five or six stores and
then it won't work on another door and

430
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:18,540
then I know or i can assume perhaps that
one of my pin positions maybe is not

431
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,649
correct

432
00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:25,259
so then i can again use that door as
another test case and I can test the

433
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:31,500
other the other heights so with larger
and more complicated systems there is

434
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:37,199
certainly a little bit more work that is
necessary but you're still driving a lot

435
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:42,149
of very important information from the
lock without doing anything invasive and

436
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:44,100
without doing anything complicated

437
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,580
it's very much like if on a computer

438
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:51,389
there was something that you could do
where it would tell you what characters

439
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,560
were in the password

440
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:58,110
it reduces your key space considerably
and it makes the brute force attack very

441
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,700
very fast

442
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,399
does that help answer your question

443
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,980
ya just if his eyes only two
possibilities of course it's very easy

444
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:15,299
to know for sure that your keys master
key without spending time to office away

445
00:35:15,299 --> 00:35:20,910
i'm gonna write you are too to check

446
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:24,990
even if you are taking a small amount of
possibilities

447
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:30,599
yes if it's a if it's a small system you
can assume that the other the other

448
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:34,650
height is is the master key but if it's
a large one you will have some more work

449
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:38,730
yeah sure there was a question yes

450
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:46,619
well no my question is do think that it
is possible to butte some device that

451
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:52,349
will do it automatically without you
know cutting my memory

452
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:58,020
that's an ingeniously is there is some
kind of adds an interesting concept or

453
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,960
something over as an interesting
question

454
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,089
so actually it should be possible

455
00:36:06,869 --> 00:36:14,279
i'm going to try to find a picture of of
a tool here

456
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,359
while while I'm looking for this

457
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,989
this there's no hdmi here so i can't
connect my phone and I'm not going to

458
00:36:26,989 --> 00:36:30,769
connect my computer to Wi-Fi ok so i'll
just have to explain it i apologize i

459
00:36:30,769 --> 00:36:38,299
was going to look it up online if you
search google images for the Sputnik

460
00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:40,609
lock pick

461
00:36:40,609 --> 00:36:51,170
it is a it's a device that has a key
with holes in it and it has wires coming

462
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:56,119
out of the holes and the purpose of this
is to be able to change the heights of

463
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:03,410
the pins without without having to use
different keys and it's a very advanced

464
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:10,308
lock-picking tool and if you in theory
were to connect such a device to say

465
00:37:10,309 --> 00:37:17,450
some motors or some servos and use some
different sensors then yes it should be

466
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:20,180
possible to build a brute forcing tool

467
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:27,499
it's it's quite possible it would be
some work and it wouldn't be cheap but

468
00:37:27,499 --> 00:37:31,999
it would be very possible to make a
brute forcing tool i would say so

469
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,780
sorry

470
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:47,970
that was the question do 3d printed keys
work

471
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:51,118
yes 3d printed keys absolutely work

472
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,249
there's been that's it that's a great
question people have done a lot of

473
00:37:56,249 --> 00:38:02,459
testing with 3d printed keys and you
know they don't have to be very strong

474
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,309
in order to work in the lock

475
00:38:05,309 --> 00:38:10,140
in fact there are programs so you can
download that will automatically

476
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:16,769
generate the STL files that you need to
3d print keys so you feed it a code you

477
00:38:16,769 --> 00:38:23,160
feed the program a code for the key and
it will automatically create the stl

478
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,319
file that you send to your 3d printer

479
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:30,720
so if you wanted to make the attack more
simple more automated and you don't have

480
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,759
access to a key cutting machine then in
theory you could write a script or a

481
00:38:35,759 --> 00:38:40,499
small program that creates these 3d
models for you automatically

482
00:38:40,499 --> 00:38:46,499
and you could say type in the code for
your existing key and it would

483
00:38:46,499 --> 00:38:50,609
automatically print a bunch of keys for
you to try and this way you don't have

484
00:38:50,609 --> 00:38:55,920
to file anything you don't have to cut
anything on a key machine almost anyone

485
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,710
with a 3d printer would be able to
execute the same attack

486
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:02,819
that's a very good question actually
hadn't thought of that until until you

487
00:39:02,819 --> 00:39:03,569
asked it

488
00:39:03,569 --> 00:39:07,499
thank you we're here and then here yes

489
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:16,300
yeah

490
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,560
yeah

491
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,869
yeah

492
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:27,170
can we give me a microphone I'm sorry
I'm having some trouble hearing in one

493
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:28,190
moment

494
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:31,609
perfect once more please

495
00:39:31,609 --> 00:39:37,609
you say is is it took away we have to
check for any special yes crotch what if

496
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:43,339
we say about security service they can
CH cameras that some persons say stay in

497
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:48,470
front of God and try to open door with
many many keys

498
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:53,930
ah so that's that's a very good question
i'm glad you asked it so if you're

499
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:58,970
saying if there is a camera and there's
someone at the door with you know 20 30

500
00:39:58,970 --> 00:39:59,779
keys

501
00:39:59,779 --> 00:40:04,099
that looks a little strange and i would
agree you have to remember that this is

502
00:40:04,099 --> 00:40:06,619
not an attack you have to do all at once

503
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:11,089
when you think about lock-picking if you
stop picking the lock

504
00:40:11,089 --> 00:40:14,720
part way through and you let go
everything is reset

505
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,109
you have to start from the beginning so
sometimes it is necessary with

506
00:40:18,109 --> 00:40:22,609
traditional lock-picking to be in front
of the lock for 10 15 20 minutes and

507
00:40:22,609 --> 00:40:28,400
this is very easy to deduct however with
this you can spread the time of your

508
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,519
attack out over the course of days weeks
or even months

509
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:37,999
so if I am a vendor let's say I repair

510
00:40:37,999 --> 00:40:42,499
I change the air filter since and you
know the server room or something on the

511
00:40:42,499 --> 00:40:45,589
outside party and I only go there once a
month

512
00:40:45,589 --> 00:40:52,190
that means once a month I can try one or
two keys and if you're fast enough it

513
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:56,359
can look like a very normal thing
especially if you pretend that oh you

514
00:40:56,359 --> 00:40:59,808
know you're on your cell phone you're
talking you walked by the door and you

515
00:40:59,809 --> 00:41:03,799
try your key and you're like oh it's not
the right door and then you keep walking

516
00:41:03,799 --> 00:41:08,059
and so if you combine this with social
engineering and you're a little bit

517
00:41:08,059 --> 00:41:14,690
smart about how you test your keys then
it becomes again much harder to detect

518
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:16,369
impossible

519
00:41:16,369 --> 00:41:20,960
no but very very difficult that sounds
more reasonable

520
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:28,460
instead of doing all the keys at once
things and we had a question here to

521
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:31,079
soak ok we'll go to you know open you

522
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:35,249
see mr. Casey James in your practice
once more please

523
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:42,390
how often my sticky systems existing in
the world

524
00:41:43,109 --> 00:41:48,808
oh uh how many master key systems are
there in the world how when you home

525
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:53,609
that's a good question I don't think
there's any official numbers

526
00:41:54,119 --> 00:42:01,890
I think it varies depending on the the
part of the world in my opinion in North

527
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:05,368
America master key systems are extremely
extremely popular

528
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:12,029
I have found that in much of Eastern
Europe and in Asia

529
00:42:12,749 --> 00:42:17,609
they're not as popular and the reason
for that is because of a diversity

530
00:42:17,609 --> 00:42:25,799
within the locks and because people seem
to change the locks more often and so

531
00:42:25,799 --> 00:42:28,200
master key systems aren't as practical

532
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:35,069
there also aren't necessarily as many
institutions that are interested in

533
00:42:35,069 --> 00:42:41,729
spending the the money and the labor of
paying a locksmith to master key system

534
00:42:41,729 --> 00:42:46,259
if you consider the extra work that goes
into preparing each lock from the

535
00:42:46,259 --> 00:42:51,839
factory and you multiply that by the
number of cylinders that you have then

536
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:56,969
some customers may not be interested in
paying for that it might be cheaper just

537
00:42:56,969 --> 00:43:01,650
to have a bunch of different keys and
this is why you know some people have a

538
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:04,650
key ring with you know a hundred keys or
something on it

539
00:43:05,609 --> 00:43:10,920
I can't say how popular it is here
because I don't spend a lot of time in

540
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:15,150
Russia unfortunately but i can tell you
at least in the u.s. master key systems

541
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:20,160
are very very common they're very
popular every university that i have

542
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:25,440
been to has had a master key system
every major office building that we

543
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,569
visited has had a master key system of
some kind and you won't find it in

544
00:43:30,569 --> 00:43:35,308
smaller businesses but if you have any
businesses that have hundreds or

545
00:43:35,309 --> 00:43:36,599
thousands of doors

546
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:40,589
then there's a higher chance that they
might have a master key system does that

547
00:43:40,589 --> 00:43:42,490
answer your question

548
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:48,939
thinking and I think we have a question
here our--our from any angle males sort

549
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:59,470
of protection agency this temple for
ethics if convenient to you some minor

550
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,009
key

551
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:06,040
are there the question was are there any
protections or mitigations against this

552
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:09,490
attack an equal protection mechanical
protections

553
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:15,939
unfortunately we're not exploiting a
defect in the lock the lock is working

554
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:21,340
exactly as an intent as intended and any
kind of protection that we come up with

555
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:28,720
would break the master key system from
working so this this attack is more a

556
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:33,879
problem with the entire idea of Master
king unless a problem with the

557
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,850
individual design of the lock

558
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:41,410
so really the only practical way to deal
with this attack is either to not use

559
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:49,629
master king or to use different locks
for doors that are very important or

560
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:56,680
just to use a electromechanical system
that combines as i mentioned something

561
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:01,720
electronic with something mechanical in
the Loch itself not access control not

562
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:10,509
rfid but something electronic in the key
as well that's unfortunately none of

563
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:12,520
those answers are very good

564
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:17,230
so the short answer is that there's no
there's no easy way to avoid this and

565
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:20,590
still have master King since the last

566
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:23,890
here's the question ok

567
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:29,500
any more questions yes yes oh yes yes

568
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:35,650
is there any way to create a I'm just
key in this attack you show that i have

569
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:44,530
one key that opens at least one door and
I assume yes I know the L'Occitane what

570
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:45,850
I don't hear anything

571
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:50,620
ok so the question is right now we are
starting with some information

572
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:54,460
yes go to get dropped if we have no
information

573
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:58,270
what do we do you have a couple of
options

574
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:05,470
one of them is you could pick the lock
with something like the Sputnik tool

575
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:11,740
that i described which uses you know
wires and then decode it that way

576
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:21,370
the other option is to use a technique
called impression and actually i can i

577
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:27,850
can show it briefly since we have some
extra time if you guys are interested

578
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:38,110
doesn't want to see another covert lock
opening technique so with imprint

579
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:44,470
impressionen is another technique that
often is used by intelligence agencies

580
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:50,560
and locksmiths alike and we'll do this

581
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:56,050
here we go so with impression we can
take a blank key and turn it into a

582
00:46:56,050 --> 00:47:00,190
working key to get some exactly the type
of information that we're looking for

583
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:06,730
and with impression when we insert a
blank key into the lock and I apologize

584
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:09,790
to the translators they don't have a
copy of this slide deck

585
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:12,790
so they're trying their best right now

586
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:20,649
you raise the key to the maximum height
and if you turn the key really hard like

587
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:26,320
with some pliers or something to hold
the key with then some of the pins in

588
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,670
the lock get stuck

589
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:34,570
they bind and as you move them up and
down they create a small mark on the key

590
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:38,250
the mark tells us that this pen is not
in the car

591
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:44,040
- position and so by removing the
material and performing this over and

592
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,000
over

593
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,260
we keep going and any time we see a mark
on the key

594
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:53,910
we remove the material and we try again

595
00:47:54,660 --> 00:48:00,330
and what happens when the key and
reaches the proper height then there

596
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:04,470
will be no mark because that pin will
not be getting stuck

597
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:13,290
it will not be binding instead there
will be a mark that appears a numark

598
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:17,640
that appears and these marks are very
just so you understand they're they're

599
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:21,180
very very hard to see if you're not
trained

600
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:29,250
does anyone see a mark on this key it's
right there it's that little dark spot

601
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:35,100
it's very delicate work it's something
that requires a great deal of practice

602
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:40,710
far more practice and lock-picking but
you can very quickly create working keys

603
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:43,020
for lock

604
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:46,020
I think we might even have yeah

605
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:50,040
here is let's see if this video place

606
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,919
it does not

607
00:48:56,430 --> 00:49:04,560
sorry we had a video and it doesn't work
but this this man here this is yours -

608
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:09,450
he is currently the Dutch impression
champion in our games are global

609
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:15,750
championships and he is able to
impression open a novice 16-cylinder and

610
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:18,930
about 1 minute 20 seconds by hand

611
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:26,100
so if you use such a technique to create
a working operating key then you can

612
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:33,420
then combine it with the master key
attack and decode the master key so that

613
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,100
would be one example that I would use

614
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:40,410
yeah and now we're out of time yeah okay
thank you very much everyone

615
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:44,720
yeah

616
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:48,670
favorite questions to get them sure

617
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:55,780
thousands of shoot I don't know

618
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:58,780
just think about that

619
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:06,009
yeah sure that I like all she knows i
like the the 3d printing question

620
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:09,010
because that was a good idea

621
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:26,620
the last where his question was a very
good one

622
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:33,490
yeah very much thank you
