1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,299
that's my presentation here in little
thing in telecoms issue

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,490
ok

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:16,200
and i want to focus on something that
has been a leader research in terms of

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:22,560
how attackers leash money of telecom
operators

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:29,340
well they're actually companies in
Russia are you trying to sell their is

6
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,230
services to tell you come off the
greatest could be is orders for example

7
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:43,150
and for some reason we're only focusing
on technical issues but then

8
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:49,269
only one these guys talk to the operator
is this a while we can interest subsidy

9
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:55,300
attacks so we can interest up to call
the operator will say well it sounds

10
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,919
interesting but is that really dangerous
we're losing money there are we

11
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:06,520
well if you're it

12
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,149
subscribers calls get intercepted that
will circulate damage your reputation

13
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,150
but not that much

14
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:20,020
let me first their hotel about the
technical things everyone i believe

15
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:28,990
should know that is all I will be
talking about the technical attacks

16
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,470
against the telecom networks

17
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:40,130
we'll talk a little bit about them to
self abuse base station attacks attacks

18
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,770
of I jeering IP networks

19
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:55,610
ss7 location SMS interception and cool
interception in Moscow def corn

20
00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:01,369
kaspersky guys had a great story
recently about femtocell attacks

21
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:08,929
i'm actually in providing a link here to
their presentations of FL to sell

22
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:20,060
essentially a small gadget like a Wi-Fi
router anyone can by installing his

23
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:25,280
words or office to route mobile traffic

24
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:34,220
now you might have heard this story of a
las vegas Paris care now senior service

25
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:43,830
where any company can actually eavesdrop
on all the calls going through the come

26
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,610
to herself

27
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:51,720
we're all the sounds bad this is being
discussed a lot for what I know in forge

28
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,570
did not really develop the hardware even
like the software for the system

29
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:10,530
themselves so kaspersky lab's you
started it felt herself with you

30
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,710
not for this purpose but rather and in
order to do a reverse engineering in

31
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:24,630
order to learn more about the traffic
going through it to the wrong so able to

32
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:30,420
get access to the IP data but
essentially it's a security gateway for

33
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:37,200
the operator for any femtocell will
connect through VPN concentrator by an

34
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:45,929
ipsec tunnel so they were able to get
access to be on the ipsec tunnel

35
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,369
you gotta really not all they did that
because they didn't really disclosed but

36
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:59,010
when we are interested in this so there
s some of the times in there traffic

37
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,359
will be rather H&B gateway you

38
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:12,760
we're here will do we are the majority
of attacks against ss7 network requires

39
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,760
a particular requests that you need to
be alone

40
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:22,960
hmv gateway in most cases will block
this request which obviously read user's

41
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,190
the one on the attack surface but the
frequency of probability of such attacks

42
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,100
nothing so that you must look at how are
you having another attack is pretty old

43
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:43,000
so what you do is build your own fake BS
BS is are easy to buy

44
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:51,880
so you have your old laptop and a stack
of open software that needs you

45
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,090
fire up the GPR restoration use for
handing it out

46
00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:02,230
it's a pretty complicated sort of attack
because most operators have pretty dense

47
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,550
coverage

48
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:11,620
meaning that very few see you guys
actually offer a GPRS most of them do

49
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:17,290
3g or LTE and in this rage assume is
frequently just a little the other

50
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,010
issues

51
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:23,500
yeah so what we can consider it either
an academic case and forever sort of

52
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:32,290
feasible case properly covered areas so
users will get connected and we give

53
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:37,810
them access to the internet all your
stack and this enables you to do your

54
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:46,419
regular mitm so essentially you do the
same stuff as he will do in a regular

55
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:55,659
matter announced mitm and if we have
somebody is a small term can actually

56
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:02,919
start sending voice through the same
cell for the same base station that

57
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:08,320
requires changing the default settings
and then he can eavesdrop on the voice

58
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,099
calls

59
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:15,940
moreover you can automatically analyze
this voice data are looking for key

60
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:25,479
words must look at a different attack
this one

61
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:29,500
hate gays grx is a global roaming
exchanged at work

62
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,180
this is the last part that our internet
traffic goes through when you use mobile

63
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,470
internet with enrollment status

64
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:41,970
when you're traveling so all telecom
operators are part of this network so

65
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:47,640
whenever you access the internets
overseas are your internet traffic will

66
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,590
be routed for this network

67
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:57,330
it's an interesting vector of attack in
order to mountains i can need to be

68
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,450
inside the natural first now this is
quite difficult to know

69
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:09,690
so the configurations i have seen our
regular ipsec tunnel leading to grx hub

70
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:14,640
using fair

71
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,630
so you won't be real able to read
external traffic

72
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:26,099
usually it's the big operators or balls
of the g RX not worth you boo

73
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,900
but if you have access to jareds network
you can come up with a feasible attack

74
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,200
you sure you want but I haven't really
seen successful attacks of this kind of

75
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,200
defaults publicly so to speak

76
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:47,639
and I don't see it as a significance of
actual attack for an operator there for

77
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:52,590
another one is a solid location sort of
attack had guys reports of psychologists

78
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,859
have already talked about this one it's
in fact a pretty well know when the

79
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:02,520
matter of the time you can mount this
one when you have access to the ss7

80
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:11,099
network you can locate a particular
subscriber using a couple of the ss7

81
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:17,310
request to you need shade at tax to
recall and the network will tell you

82
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,310
which but secular switch you

83
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:24,539
this user is connected to a beaut

84
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:32,519
so all switches and all the other
movements are registering the database

85
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:39,269
the database is publicly available the
same is true for the location data so

86
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:45,000
you can see in this picture how know
guys were able to identify the location

87
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,649
particular subscriber

88
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:52,290
well in the vicinity of a particular
destination is like before

89
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,740
so again this is an attack against the
subscriber which means that they operate

90
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,010
for the carrier doesn't care that much

91
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:06,899
I mean they would want to mitigate those
threats but not very much

92
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,680
it would be passionate about it SMS and
call interception in ss7 again positive

93
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,209
technologies people have already covered
this one if you have an ss7 access he

94
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:27,329
can intercept texts so we have their own
variation of a mighty em we're not

95
00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:32,640
talking the subsequent you essentially
you represent yourself as sue you're not

96
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:43,680
yeah take an intercept course you can
interest on the SMS is like this

97
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:55,910
it's not easy to melt but it can be done
again

98
00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:00,920
I know that this is a subscriber
targeting attack which means that the

99
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,849
operator of the carrier doesn't have too
many sentences to protect gates it

100
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:11,390
let me switch now to the main part of my
presentation where I'm gonna focus on

101
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:15,439
the things i'll be Kerry's really really
care about because this is where they

102
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:23,210
kept his money made Morris Morris has a
very active and also young person who

103
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:28,640
knows a little bit about operators and
he is going to be for all sorts of

104
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:37,280
interesting arrangements for attacks
using now let's distinguish between

105
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:46,910
internal and external schemas or crime
that you be so this suspicious activity

106
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:52,850
can be allocated either inside the
carrier's metrical roadsides outside its

107
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:57,140
it could be a violation for example the
roaming agreement inside and a spark

108
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,380
there will be many more potential cases
that were looking at

109
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,279
yeah

110
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:13,819
- let's start with the external one who
has given you the music that rescue is a

111
00:11:13,819 --> 00:11:17,389
wall showing here is that we have a
Russian operator and say here at the in

112
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:20,579
operator

113
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:26,910
so they have an agreement on billing
each other

114
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:40,259
you go roaming traffic with and a
roaming operator will undertake to use

115
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:45,929
up to use this particular sort of a kind
of an exclusivity agreement so if the

116
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:55,079
Russian tourists stays say in Europe and
then calls his family in Russia the year

117
00:11:55,079 --> 00:12:02,248
being operator and will undertake to
serve this traffic by early home

118
00:12:02,249 --> 00:12:08,970
operator not some other operating room
now will cost everybody ten dollars but

119
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,569
you do understand that sometimes they
don't feel like doing it

120
00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:16,439
that might cause some ten dollars to
send this train this is where Boris

121
00:12:16,439 --> 00:12:19,319
comes in very says hi

122
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:23,040
I know you're getting loads of tourists
and the old cold home

123
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:29,669
you must have heard already I'm sorry
I've heard that you pay ten dollars per

124
00:12:29,669 --> 00:12:34,949
minutes and the carrier agrees to stay
Casey well I suppose the same kind of

125
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:40,709
service they will cost you ten times
less who agreed he's a strong motivator

126
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:57,220
Lord system can actually sell the order
for a dollar so Boris cool down son is

127
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:06,700
traffic to Moscow and the ER operational
sunday in Russia I'll traffic through

128
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:14,290
Boris start actually discovering it with
more than anti-fraud systems is pretty

129
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:25,329
easy and righteous Russia's a leading
carriers reacts violently actually

130
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,630
whenever they really seen

131
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:33,430
that's some somebody's suspicious they
will disconnect Boris right away

132
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:37,810
no making for is significantly less rich

133
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:40,810
I used to be a profitable business

134
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:51,180
Boris status let's look now at internal
friends do

135
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:57,689
let's stop the same box singles as
possibly the most well-known sort of

136
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:58,589
activity

137
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:03,540
ok seen boxing is when you've got all
these specialized equipment

138
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:12,000
it's already available in the market he
can easily ball you know a gadget like

139
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,230
this done he put into the same box the
same cards you gold from a different

140
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,160
operator

141
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,689
let's look at case number one you have
several sim cards say the same cars from

142
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,690
operate for to that is located in a
different country

143
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:31,649
yeah

144
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:41,869
about you can advertise traffic to that
particular operator

145
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:49,520
for one dollar per minute while calling
the same country and legitimately or

146
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,520
coerce people two times more

147
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:57,889
pepper's own zone there's nobody here
and store

148
00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:04,459
yeah my name is the way it works is as
follows the forest the purpose is to it

149
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:10,430
yeah he is physically inside the country

150
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:14,899
he speaking in local rates

151
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:25,699
you guys look at that I guess him an
heir really nice profit margins because

152
00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:31,008
he can have a simple where the non-state
connection with operator 12 so he

153
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:39,230
doesn't pay a lot but we must look at a
slightly different case you can have for

154
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:39,949
example

155
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:45,740
unlimited sir for calling plans and then
you will be calling to any operator

156
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:54,079
whatsoever you because he have unlimited
coal plants use on in this case you get

157
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:59,209
a higher profit then he'll probably have
more issues again it's very easy to

158
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:02,079
discover the law is like this

159
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:09,550
because their systems will show that and
small number of SIM card is generating a

160
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,680
lot of traffic

161
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,439
however legislation can be different in
different countries

162
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:22,330
so what can happen for example that a
carrier will blog the same card but i

163
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:27,190
will not actually be able to see the
berm

164
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,959
so what the purpose duly simply obtain a
new sim cards

165
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:36,459
so this particular technique in many
countries here is still viable

166
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:42,369
I'm sort of inviting you to try it out
but do remember is criminally not okay

167
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,940
let's look now it's stuff that slightly
more complicated

168
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:54,760
I'm about to tell you oh oh carriers
building is structured as shown here on

169
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,649
network switches

170
00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:02,740
you know where calls from other
operators land in the cetera

171
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,870
somebody will go through additional
information for exam

172
00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:00,100
both leave here I'm sorry is some custom
ourselves especially postpaid others

173
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:09,699
will be prepaid and billing for them
obviously will be done differently then

174
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:17,350
feeling system will put everything into
dwh a data warehouse for example 3

175
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,820
months old data

176
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,840
nobody needs it really easy we'll go
back through will go straight to storage

177
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,639
service or something that will go into
an erp system first interesting stuff

178
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,179
goes to the payment gateway because this
is where the settlements with other

179
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:36,700
operators are executed and settlements
with other policies interested in our

180
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,450
money

181
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:44,830
report generation you discounts they all
happen later as well

182
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:53,559
we don't care about them that you can
actually learn more if you follow this

183
00:18:53,559 --> 00:19:01,300
link you see you again

184
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:09,139
let's look at it's a particular attack
scenarios or crime scene ears

185
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:16,760
I hiding from building so Boris in this
case is an employee of the operator

186
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,760
he could be a manager but not
necessarily

187
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:26,659
well maybe he knows somebody who works
there and he device this person sharing

188
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:30,140
his profit so Boris is our year

189
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:34,760
he just felt this is a test let's
establish a link like I have my own

190
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,890
company a small telecom operator and
blest ever shall link now between the

191
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:47,780
two operators able mask mean bound
traffic from me

192
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:57,110
our cameras flashing it as yours what
this means is that Boris will find

193
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:03,979
subscribers pay him money they will make
calls that operation one will end up

194
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,320
paying for this course

195
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:13,909
speak easy to perform really all we
gotta do is connect to one more cable in

196
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:17,299
his server room and do a bit of setup as
well

197
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:28,220
yeah I lose your world more such an
arrangement can be discovered if you do

198
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:37,039
financial analysis and if the operator
is a analyzing the evolution of course

199
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:43,699
well they should be able to see that
they actually paying money for the

200
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:57,649
overseas calls but when I getting paid
for them launch operators have found

201
00:20:57,649 --> 00:21:01,879
what they call yields us

202
00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:10,189
yes but effectively they have agreements
with other operators so say that the

203
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:13,190
kind of promised a particular volume

204
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:54,440
mr. like you you should remember that it
could be enough to just make for a

205
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,070
pretty comfortable life where two or
three people but you can't get a single

206
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:05,539
reach really do you will get noticed
your operators obviously will do sort of

207
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:34,790
customer among the operators to North
care about deviations of three to five

208
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:37,399
percent so if you keep a low profile

209
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:47,240
you do not get arrogance you can
actually stay below the Raider and now

210
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:52,190
i'm guessing that many people are
actually living up a scenario like this

211
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,170
quite nicely

212
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:58,700
but again they don't feel the reach
let's look now at a more complicated

213
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,470
scenarios

214
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:08,030
what's interesting about it is that
while in the previous while we most the

215
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:17,060
outbound traffic in this one will be
hiding the incoming traffic so Boris for

216
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:22,790
his friends are working for operate 40
showing a clock here

217
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:26,330
it could be a local club

218
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,620
inbound traffic -

219
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:51,100
no numbers some operator one is inside
and that's where night

220
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:58,450
it's inbound traffic we don't pay for it
right

221
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:08,800
which means that the magnitude of what
you do will only be limited by your

222
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,240
greed

223
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,460
there's nobody base I mean the victim
doesn't really pay for this traffic and

224
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:20,200
the way that equipment is set up the
stuff will not get noticed

225
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:27,280
e

226
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:37,600
what's also interesting about it is out
the anti-fraud systems even if this data

227
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,439
actually go through the anti-fraud
system else anti-fraud systems are not

228
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,500
taught to actually discover it

229
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:54,280
let's look into the technical details a
mediation sister i mentioned previously

230
00:24:54,280 --> 00:25:02,678
will translate the information coming
from switches into billing data so we're

231
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:03,970
showing here

232
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:07,090
individual user level so when a user
makes a call

233
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:15,639
CDR is generated LCDR he recalled utrs
you dr d 2 goes into the mediation

234
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,669
system and

235
00:25:18,669 --> 00:25:25,570
ml grated or transform data goes into
the billing system shown on the right is

236
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:26,889
the example of such data

237
00:25:26,889 --> 00:25:40,899
it's an XML we have a nice eh coll
dinners you can easily compromised it he

238
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:50,139
can for example change the kind of coats
that apply to either in rate plan or the

239
00:25:50,139 --> 00:25:58,748
trunk numbers so you can easily swap the
ids and that's why traffic coming from

240
00:25:58,749 --> 00:26:04,899
some suspicious location will be
identified as to traffic coming from a

241
00:26:04,899 --> 00:26:09,609
well-known operator so that he will have
to pay for it or we can delete this data

242
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:15,158
you can actually stay that all called
data coming from this trunk or this

243
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:20,169
numbers will nolles be contributed to
the billing system will be simply

244
00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:21,609
deleted

245
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:28,059
moreover some billing systems are set up
in a better you

246
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:33,050
that make sure that's how whenever

247
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:41,240
yeah they get CRA you are so don't have
trunk IDs

248
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,780
they won't processes information so
nobody gets billed at all

249
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:57,080
now he's gonna be you and this is a
pretty easy to pull off sanara if you

250
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,409
know the right people and it's very
difficult to discover

251
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,460
yeah because you're anti-fraud systems
will not be able to discover it because

252
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:15,020
so interested in attacks like listen
while all the interested parties could

253
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,430
be brought

254
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:19,430
yeah

255
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,340
the most

256
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,830
traffic loping with you

257
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:57,780
shown here is a simple technical loop so
an incoming cold is balanced two

258
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:03,330
different operator a for some reason
will return the call back to our

259
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,770
operator

260
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:11,639
you know in our operator you

261
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:17,340
this is an incoming call you there and
returns it to I that's a regular

262
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,770
technical problem

263
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:28,860
so if you do that you can easily get a
ddos because you Jim up the channel very

264
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,860
quickly

265
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:41,389
well this is where you can actually make
money because here you have three

266
00:28:41,389 --> 00:28:45,529
operators we have the victim operator

267
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:52,880
I operators a and B which one

268
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:59,269
yeah I was not enough word

269
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:07,070
you know for this stuff to be workable
and a red blouse should differ in

270
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,779
balance calls for

271
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:16,549
hey we should cost more than outbound
calls for my and that's what we're

272
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:18,649
showing here operator his pay

273
00:29:18,649 --> 00:29:27,289
as1 while a base be as - well be base
operator s3 and i want to show you here

274
00:29:27,289 --> 00:29:29,419
is one is the largest payment

275
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:32,419
that's the way it works and all

276
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,760
when operate

277
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,780
b will return this call to her victim
operator

278
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,780
that's an even lower price

279
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:34,240
actually some of this other a press can
be bond of the same company some big

280
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,560
telecom operators work around the world
and operator B can easily be a

281
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:43,659
subsidiary of our victim operator in
another country and in this case s3 can

282
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:48,070
be very close to zero because there's a
lot of the same family

283
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:18,010
it's actually quite difficult to
discover in areas like this because a

284
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:24,460
number can easily change you know that
will be difficult for us to track the

285
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:27,400
cold

286
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,090
he has been Lopes and we want even know
whether it's the same

287
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:42,159
: initially we're not so easy even a
good anti-fraud system can be useless

288
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,800
CDR

289
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:53,860
our example we see three lines there one
corresponds to call that was made

290
00:31:56,669 --> 00:32:05,489
the moon and the calling numbers started
with seven and they came from trunk one

291
00:32:05,489 --> 00:32:18,330
to switch 0 you and he was redirected to
operate for a from switch 0 this is our

292
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:30,539
s1 here after the chart that operator a
sends it to operator B we only have

293
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:37,499
limited information here which is really
shown here are our CDR log doesn't show

294
00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:38,460
it

295
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:44,909
and next we see a name coming call from
operator be so we see it's the same

296
00:32:44,909 --> 00:32:47,909
calling party

297
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:55,320
but you'll see that the trunk ID and the
switch

298
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:01,649
IDR different and since we care so much
about the price

299
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:08,730
we sound the call again to operate right
you there by closing the look

300
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:12,420
actually after that operator a can

301
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:16,530
re regular call two different operator
not be and that's where you can go

302
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:19,980
through several loops able to the know
it

303
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:28,440
such an elegant skiing really difficult
to discover but operators are trying to

304
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,870
fight it

305
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:34,530
this is it for me usually

306
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:24,820
which

307
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:29,710
we know well logs and about existing
attack so that's kind of God way we

308
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:34,900
operate really terrible have to be money
right away but it's difficult to

309
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,900
monetize it in any other manner

310
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:51,610
you know what it's for a purpose that
she didn't mention the type of incidents

311
00:34:53,810 --> 00:35:00,290
where user equipment is compromise in
order to send traffic to

312
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:06,540
the rise of expensive destination this
is how you can bankrupt telecom operator

313
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,540
that's true sure

314
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:22,140
you want to see if he can easily happen
at a corporate customers equipment is

315
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:27,270
compromised and then feeling words of
traffic

316
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:31,740
these bastards so everybody loses right

317
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:38,520
i Sh night I didn't mention it is right
well because actually the losses their

318
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,390
colossal compared to the losses from
scenario you described

319
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:47,070
I'm sorry I should also give you a
t-shirt

320
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:51,660
I've got to thank you for your report

321
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:58,230
so you talk about some Boris who could
do seem boxing you

322
00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:11,719
and I wondering what will keep Boris for
all month

323
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:16,880
having several seen boxes and separating
the traffic so that nothing is

324
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,170
suspicious

325
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:25,849
nothing now if the amount of traffic
doesn't trigger the alarms to the

326
00:36:25,849 --> 00:36:27,619
anti-fraud system

327
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:33,890
he's pretty well protected so if he's
not arrogant if he's not to agree

328
00:36:34,489 --> 00:36:40,130
he won't get caught but the way it works
is is that schools go through the same

329
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:44,719
cars all the time so much will really
depend on the set of the anti-fraud

330
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:47,719
system

331
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:04,870
there's also transporter transmission
case right where you have Boris in a

332
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:18,460
difference but in an adjacent territory
and that way if he uses a narrow focus

333
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:22,930
and Tina to actually get signal from a
different country

334
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:29,890
so formally is physically outside the
country where he bought the same card

335
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:43,990
now that's an interesting vector and I
think that's a more than a the same

336
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:46,419
boxes it already

337
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:50,710
hold each other and they can easily do
you

338
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:59,590
by doing that the older and I pro
systems can you please go back to try

339
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:02,590
angular's schematic

340
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:07,680
ok an s-1 be bigger than a stream

341
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:19,859
I don't think i will be able to sell a
transit call at a price higher than what

342
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:25,589
i'm paying and if it's a little somebody
will have to terminate a bowl

343
00:38:25,589 --> 00:38:31,560
otherwise nobody will get pays so
holiday I know when I will start

344
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:36,930
monetizing it do is a separate case
we're not discussing it

345
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:39,930
we are trying to monetize the goal here
after all

346
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:48,960
so operator hi yeah it's an inbound call
if this call is not supported satisfied

347
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,520
nobody will get money

348
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:56,490
indeed it's I should have shown the call
termination here the second leg service

349
00:38:56,490 --> 00:39:02,970
but i actually believe it's hugely
complex this arrangement you're showing

350
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:12,689
that it requires a lot of insider
information where you have links that

351
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:21,000
allow their capacity series while the
simple case is when you have operated 40

352
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
and operator be that are part of the
same family

353
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:30,000
and it's sort of easy if their friends
they know a lot about each other

354
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:34,590
other questions please

355
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:59,910
all about anti-fraud for SMS in German
and suspicious as I mass campaigns

356
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:07,230
no I mean the ones from don't have phone
numbers or go into details or contact

357
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:20,670
links who I know is that the recent acts
of telegram involved SMS confirmation if

358
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:24,780
you have access to SS 70 can interest of
DT so what you're talking about no it's

359
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:29,250
a different case and wonder even who
takes in boxing or a sum as banking

360
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:32,550
brother

361
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:40,859
initiate calls we can land the tags
there by selling a summers based

362
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:43,500
authentication I don't have any data on
that

363
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:48,930
Thank You senator okay thank you very
much

364
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:55,118
I'm a hunting over t-shirts the to jump
in here

365
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:55,359
thank you
