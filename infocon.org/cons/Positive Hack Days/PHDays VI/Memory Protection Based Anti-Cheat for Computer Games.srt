36
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,280
lot of money around 1 million u.s.
dollars per year right

37
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,000
not now some of those pairings are
reinvested in the development of you

38
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,430
cheating software

39
00:03:53,430 --> 00:04:01,320
why did to the compete vs you when you
entertaining software products

40
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,459
the developers and publishers of games
are the new rule

41
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:14,619
you have the dough little not putting me
out the door

42
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:23,380
I need to sort of thoughts to do my best

you

45
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:41,889
you doing here which is there is a graph
with the cheetah paw on what it's like

46
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:48,189
basically what his skin comfortable the
system seems online

47
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,480
yeah

48
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:08,180
it's a smooth them yet that's considered
several examples examples of cheats for

49
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:19,460
popular online games such as the World
of Tanks the developer of war gaming

50
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:27,859
created a dedicated directory for
notified files which include binary

51
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:40,700
files for scripts textures in one way or
the other of the developer encourages

52
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:45,979
the developers to develop such things in
order to find out about your experiences

53
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:52,340
in order to improve the client side as a
developer

54
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,909
yeah I don't know that is long guys with
them

55
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:04,040
nice in financing down here that's easy
Google's four hangers to be able to see

56
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:09,770
information about a lies on ourselves or
to analyze calm down on the other hand

57
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:18,770
they're forbidden notifications for
which tankers may be down for example

58
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:25,370
factors set allowed to identify the
vulnerable tank modules in order to make

59
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,430
it easier of fighting the fellow
fighting an enemy

60
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:34,400
another example is a cheat for the
removal or

61
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,830
or bushes here

62
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,039
tanker in the tank believe that he is
well protected

63
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:43,260
however he's 100-percent exposed and
this is the second screen shot the way

64
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:47,130
it looks like it looks the way it should

65
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,540
you cannot see of the enemy another
notification is a script that allows

66
00:07:54,540 --> 00:08:07,110
reloading tanks guns a repair tanks on
the fly and nothing to do with my dad

67
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:19,169
image is playing you almost everything
good - doesn't lose my voice out onto

68

69
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,599
the annual she didn't

70
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:37,740
and here you can see shitting a product
for the call of duty

71
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:45,660
it is commercial product key and a we
developed anti-cheating methodology for

72
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,260
it

73
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:56,189
it is a commercial trading software of
that allows to aim and enemies personnel

74
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,270
or equipment

75
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:06,959
automatic land you can use 2d or 3d
renders you can see of enemy troops

76
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,810
behind walls

77
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:20,790
oh well and the the enemy's troops are
depicted as those squares here on the

78

screen for you to understand will

79
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:33,680
developed the shuttle to the caption

although of the can be combined for some
reason in a game or you're in no

independent if you're working on a local

95
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:40,170

111
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:14,399
ago or bicycle our writers were accused
for using mothers on their bikes

112
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:23,310
I a try to find out how much such a
concealed water with the battery would

113
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,239
cost

114
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:32,070
well everything is riding percent
concealed you will not see it on the

115
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:43,200
bike with control bottom on the steering
handle what kind of lessons can we draw

116
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,450
from at some time ago

117
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:54,149
the press release was published by of
international of a bicyclist a union

118
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:57,149
adult

119
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:08,740
in them mr. we used to look at the rear
wouldn't steal the election with the

120
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,760
chicken meal and hold it thinking the
present in the fridge to do with mr.

121
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:26,110
Shin need to be vigilant in the future
to teach in a basket with a visit to the

122
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:36,490
idiot machine continue living in the
trust the solutions that are used such

123
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:44,050
as the server solution for cheating
software are those server based

124
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:49,630
solutions really secure allowing to
every gate information what does the

125
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:57,700
server do it collects the user starts if
you can compare game results you can

126
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:03,340
compare gamers their statistics
deviations from the typical styles

127
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,370
well it cannot be broken

128
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:13,030
a server-based a trading software cannot
be welcome

129
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:23,650
because for this you need to crack the
server itself the worst . here it is .

130
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:27,189
the absolute easy we g2

131
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,600
mhm

132
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,870
Chester communica social justice system
100 cities which are talking about

133
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,880
political comment

134
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,319
she got the solution that will be just a
little party but instead of anything

135
00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:47,329
let's make a position at least according
to my mind you

136
00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:54,979
what kind of the most diverse cities
there are stealing over because it

137
00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:02,600
didn't feel like he's just you know
people at home watching a great don't

138
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,149
want people with all that money

139
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:08,360
kitchen develop a spare you will come to
send a single

140
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:16,040
that is because our school social
relation to the bottom of the conclusion

141
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,300
that i would get off work at the Greek
Theatre sweet petite Fleur

142
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,930
I will help of the short story

143
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,870
she got the little icon

144
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:37,010
i need <percent> twenty percent
</percent> possibility to deal with that

145
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:41,330
some of my spirit of a 27-6 team

146
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:46,100
the simplest approach is it down you're
scanning your system

147
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:53,180
I'm always afraid and you love such
things when I plane I don't find myself

148
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:57,650
sometimes county and it doesn't really
scare me

149
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:06,560
you usually go well although treating
products they make screenshots usually

150
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,869
knows which I don't like it was really
good to see you

151
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:20,420
just people as you need to the women i
was interested in exploring how one of

152
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:27,349
pretty old to the cheating new product
of work in this unit at a certain point

153
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,400
of time

154
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:34,670
antivirus software started identifying
and please do live as a virus

155
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:43,699
salmo what do they do interviews they
declared this industry that use that

156
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:51,350
they were a antivirus software
themselves they a shot just generally

157
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:58,460
it's all the other antivirus products
and use us to the biggest challenge your

158
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:09,500
local cheating products are is getting
access to personal data which are to be

159
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:14,720
protected by various licensing terms and
agreements

160
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,720
we're not kidding about pulling in this
direction

161
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:32,230
in our work we started from analyzing
simple cheats such an art

162
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,820
really

163
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,340
yeah

164
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,340
do you

165
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,929
you

166
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:47,929
but you know

167
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,290
yeah

168
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:52,340
yeah

169
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,340
normal

170
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,510
which the business

171
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,890
you

172
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,750
yeah

173
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,750
you just

174
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,800
you

175
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,690
is the court in land on the server

176
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:48,669
them are we engaged in considering
exploring more advanced the cheating

177
00:18:48,670 --> 00:19:02,500
products for specific games allowing the
gamer but we have advantages of that the

178
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:12,610
other players cannot have the grant
access to normal and concealed data we

179
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:21,280
have analyzed the cheat for 10 shooter

180
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:33,730
it features an aimbot allows locating
enemy troops all this slide you can see

181
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:43,120
the sheet the way it is seen by the user
you can see where the enemy troops are

182
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,370
their names

183
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:53,590
distances their state owes other objects
such as first eight kids weapons rounds

184
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,760
and so on and so forth

185
00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:03,460
on top of that it features automated
shooting you can set up in such a way as

186
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:10,840
to make it should automatically aiming
an enemy troops heels you can do nothing

187
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,870
and it will be doing everything on its
own

188
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:19,540
killing enemy troops we decided to
explore

189
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:28,720
under standard we use closest monitor
but we found out that she was using anti

190
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:37,480
debugging and every time process monitor
was used of the cheating software would

191
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,929
be identified and shut down

192
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,470
actually

193
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:54,330
this point

194
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:59,370
yeah

195
00:21:02,269 --> 00:21:04,360
yeah

196
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:13,449
except for the fact that it was
dependent on kernel32.dll that we try to

197
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:20,590
analyze the memory the memory of the
game always connected cheat

198
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:30,970
we found out that there would be file a
variable pointing at the Chiefs and the

199
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:38,440
file on the disk but unfortunately we
found nothing specific or useful

200
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:46,750
we also compared memory dump sweet with
chip and without it we looked for the

201
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:52,120
differences in the editor with the use
of template and we found out that a

202
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:58,899
mouse of the differences were in a
relocation sections only which was in

203
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:09,700
line with normal behavior proceeding
from the results we are understood that

204
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:18,309
the chief was using traditional code
intrusion method that works in the

205
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:19,299
following way

206
00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:29,740
the cheat is launched on behalf of the
administrator is included in the game

207
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:37,210
requests memory in the process of
playing record some code into the memory

208
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:46,720
and X the game to execute as a result we
are playing a game with a cheat's

209
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,940
incorporated in as we decided to protect
ourselves against that cheat in the

210
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,990
following way

211
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:58,840
firstly we decided to add something to
the executable memory should that should

212
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,870
be introduced

213
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,870
it means that it will change a

214
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:30,710
e were checking their integrity of the
process of playing every five seconds

215
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:37,580
however we did not find any
notifications the integrity was a

216
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:46,370
interact at least is a memory about we
subscribe to witch mountain top of the

217
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:51,500
sheet was working differently or about
uh it was capable of restoring those

218
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:59,630
sections of memory after penetration
which led us to another idea we decided

219
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:06,620
to find out how the cheat or was getting
access to the required data we are to be

220
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:13,459
bugger and decided to change the name of
the game in the memory which affect the

221
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,460
information displayed by the cheat

222
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:21,830
we found out that at least the names of
the players of the gamers were not

223
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,060
stored by it

224
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:32,210
after that we decided to change the
sequence of fields of the class and we

225
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:36,530
found out that it affect that the
behavior of the cheat it will stop

226
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:37,460
working

227
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:50,260
now we decided to increase those
critical data in order not to ELA a

228
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:53,560
the cheating software to understand them
and to display them

229
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:38,990
and we see nobody here

230
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:46,670
we engaged in short study a hundred
percent

231
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:55,520
how much of the day time should be
increased its to make the cheating

232
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:00,139
software stop working and we found out
that at least the coordinates of the

233
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,410
gamers camera should be encrypted

234
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:09,740
we also encrypt the coordinates of the
camera

235
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,780
and after several attempts over

236
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:48,180
cheap I was bound to cheat cheating
software was installed on my machine and

237
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:55,410
we thought that we were threatened or we
decided to ask for a reason of being

238
00:26:55,410 --> 00:27:02,190
down as a form of the next day I came to
the forum but i did not find the topic

239
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:10,020
with my questions and I try to start the
cheating software and i found it working

240
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:16,230
with me that I had been gunned down in
the same way him down after that

241
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:22,800
a colleague of mine decided to install
the chip on his machine and he was down

242
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:14,190
test of the methodology isn't that
different

243
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:24,200
diversion the game had direct access to
the critical data and then now we have

244
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:35,470
game and the game started to gain access
to data through the trusted codes will

245
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:40,720
trust integrity verification module so
the game can't get the data and this is

246
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,380
corrupt

247
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:49,539
well it's corrupted and if somebody has
corrupted such as heart money then the

248
00:28:49,539 --> 00:28:52,990
trusted code informs the games about it
now

249
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:57,399
more details about have this dramatic
works in this case the code is not

250
00:28:57,399 --> 00:29:00,399
encrypted which

251
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,100
it informs the trusted code what

252
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:11,178
you either to update the code in the
memory or just three

253
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:21,380
at step to the trusted code has two very
fire who has called it what the calling

254
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:27,590
function wise to to do this we need to
sign the game is any special tools where

255
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:34,399
we can see where the return address
belongs which range and if it is indeed

256
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:39,830
the game's called a yes we can protest
the request otherwise it could be just

257
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:42,439
cheese and we say sorry but no

258
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:51,169
now once we've verified that it was a
game function that called us we start

259
00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:56,450
verifying the data integrity in the
memory using the key

260
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,779
the integrity has been

261
00:30:01,779 --> 00:30:08,799
premised we start executing the request
it is either to return the data if it's

262
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:15,309
about a read all to sign new data
business and write it back into memory

263
00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:21,279
if it's in the case of right to protect
the key

264
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:29,439
that's embedded into the trusted code we
recommend to obfuscate it rotten apples

265
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:36,339
grown please put it this way and the
National Bank didn't go

266
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:46,839
uniting 1,000 years to get you the
present you this year with this union

267
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:51,908
it's all because of all the next comment
about this method is that this method

268
00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:58,629
protects the game from the simple from a
simple cheap such as art money if art

269
00:30:58,629 --> 00:31:06,879
money girls here then the trusted codes
will see the changes and will inform the

270
00:31:06,879 --> 00:31:08,439
game about it

271
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:19,029
the second schematic shows the operation
of the method where we are encrypting

272
00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:25,359
the data here we'll use the key to
encrypt and decrypt critical data in the

273
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:32,769
memory the difference from the previous
schematic is that trusted code is

274
00:31:32,769 --> 00:31:37,239
responsible for encryption here because
this case it was only spare responsible

275
00:31:37,239 --> 00:31:43,089
for signing it also offers skates the
code that has verified the code that is

276
00:31:43,089 --> 00:31:49,029
called it and we know we also recommend
to obfuscate the key

277
00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:54,040
Queen up with one hand this message is
you well as protecting the game from

278
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:59,050
the device collection because changes
and we're further

279
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:05,050
I got to show you a video how the gay
we've done museums with a sheet and you

280
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:09,250
might get perspective about our anti
cheat the first and second violent

281
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:14,200
I can be combined so as to protect
yourself from any kind of tampering of

282
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:22,480
data in the memory the pros and cons of
our anti-cheat method of the pros

283
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:29,110
I'd like to note that there are factors
like for instance the valve advance and

284
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:36,280
sheet sometimes bands so valve
anti-cheat such as band those players

285
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,379
who were not to Lane

286
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:45,730
our method does not conflict with
antiviral with antivirus then we do not

287
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:52,360
infringe on the country inches in den
she ality of the game is of the minuses

288
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,199
I'd like to note the requirement for the
refactoring of the game

289
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:03,670
implementation is needed integration of
the cheese and sophistication signing us

290
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:06,670
a function that interact directly with
the module

291
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:22,030
we have made our implementation of the
end of sheet using the Intel tools for

292
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:25,540
education and population we succeeded

293
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:30,010
and so we brought into this situation
that she'd stopped working

294
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:37,240
we understand the software protection is
not so reliable because works in the

295
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,910
same domain as the user and the akka

296
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:43,870
so we were developing this methodology

297
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:51,550
considering that modern hardware already
protects hardware-based security methods

298
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:55,780
and that relates to both the intel cpus
and arm

299
00:33:55,780 --> 00:34:04,480
they're quite accessible to the problem
is that the users are worried to get the

300
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,770
latest model of the GPU rather than cpu
so maybe in the future

301
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:19,629
I methodology may be applied may be
extended to hardware support fit very

302
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:25,330
well our understanding that the software
that the anti cheat consists it contains

303
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:31,960
is only a part of the overall cheat
fighting strategy

304
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:38,949
it makes sense to take care that game
developers should follow certain rules

305
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:42,219
and recommendations and make cheat safe

306
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:48,310
engines something similar to a secure
coding for a regular developers

307
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,030
thank you very much for your attention
we are about to show you the video

308
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:55,030
perhaps the most exciting part of the
presentation

309
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:19,309
so this is the first version of the
video when the game happens with h

310
00:35:19,309 --> 00:35:22,609
let's hope it's not protected just for
you to compare as a benchmark

311
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:34,190
yeah

312
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:40,579
sorry mistake and this version its
protective version sorry about that

313
00:35:41,089 --> 00:35:44,270
let me go back to the unprotected one

314
00:35:44,869 --> 00:35:48,290
so were killed

315
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:55,550
often but not that sorry

316
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,100
yeah

317
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,589
yeah

318
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:08,630
yeah

319
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,770
yeah

320
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:12,770
Shh

321
00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:18,510
yeah

322
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,970
yeah

323
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,970
yeah

324
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,399
yeah

325
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,210
yeah

326
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:31,920
yeah

327
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,200
yeah

328
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,200
yeah

329
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,990
ok

330
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,069
yeah

331
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:45,450
yeah

332
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:48,538
yeah

333
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,740
yeah

334
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,100
yeah

335
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,270
yeah

336
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:57,270
yeah

337
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:03,190
ok

338
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:06,589
yeah

339
00:37:06,589 --> 00:37:11,269
that's where

340
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:16,640
and now you're going to see a chief
protected version

341
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:27,200
yeah

342
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:34,990
yeah

343
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:39,680
yeah

344
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,549
ok

345
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:45,600
equities erica is a cozy at the radar is
empty

346
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,990
that's fucked him these are out of
action

347
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:54,270
it's not but it's some remains of the
teeth still in the game

348
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:04,590
yeah

349
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,340
yeah

350
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:11,090
I don't show

351
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:15,140
so that's that's it welcome puzzles

352
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:19,460
welcome your questions please please use
the microphones

353
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:26,060
thank you very much for the presentation

354
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,560
have you seen the blizzard games how
protected are they

355
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:34,370
no we haven't as far as I remember

356
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:39,650
<operand> one </operand> there's a thing
that we haven't talked about

357
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:43,190
it's called the battlenet the reason
Heather out saying they start asking of

358
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:49,790
uses asking real IDs of users to make it
so that the game account should match

359
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:53,150
their you know physical address and the
real person

360
00:38:54,590 --> 00:39:00,440
they started very actively to push this
and then there was a row that one of the

361
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,940
employee said it doesn't matter i can
assign an address to anyone and

362
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:08,810
immediately all the information about
them became available to everyone away

363
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,790
lives way it goes for shopping

364
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:16,759
no we didn't look at visit they have
some social engineering of their cheats

365
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:22,340
in addition to what I've said they try a
to understand using your friends who

366
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,450
your friends are

367
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:27,770
if you retreat or not if you achieve
that then perhaps so you carry a higher

368
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:33,380
risk protections are basically the same
with everyone both server side and local

369
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:37,940
side of the methods and approaches are
not very much different to everybody

370
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:38,750
knows that

371
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:45,950
thank you very much you mentioned how
our protection methods and you mentioned

372
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,060
that the

373
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:52,160
already some in existence in did you
mean the in place a system that in turn

374
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,870
is now implementing I forget the code
name or marketing name or did you mean

375
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:58,130
something different you

376
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:03,020
well armed as far as I know has a system

377
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:11,210
I forget the name is interval has n
plays the so-called and place the

378
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:15,170
marketing name is different so specific
next you can use that

379
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:22,100
why not this is memory protection and
execution and TPM a is applicable

380
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:26,060
what TPM just about about the model

381
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:36,950
I don't think that it has a simple and
easy public access compared to live or

382
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:40,129
do you mean all the specifications are
old one

383
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:46,160
we have to understand the reason that
there once to replace let's say software

384
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:55,310
application by some hardware mechanism a
TPM and has a reputable codes a vm such

385
00:40:55,310 --> 00:41:01,730
as management engine but I guess it's
not an easy thing to get access to it

386
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:05,690
I mean for a developer of an answer
sheet just you be on the year

387
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:08,750
so you must explicitly acknowledged for
encryption

388
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:17,210
perhaps some things could be used but i
don't think that is going to be much

389
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:24,470
more secure than software based
methodology based in office keishon you

390
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:28,970
have to understand that people who
cheats they owe the system they can

391
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:35,209
debug the processes and the gate access
to what they want did ask us a question

392
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,830
yeah

393
00:41:42,619 --> 00:41:49,880
thank you for your presentation you can
you tell me your methodology does it

394
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:56,390
allow one to protect myself from data
school thing

395
00:41:57,079 --> 00:42:02,240
it's a server protocol that's going to
be so it's not just a memory-based to

396
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:10,729
data modification but rather strip a
packet-based consideration and

397
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:12,740
modification of data at this level

398
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:20,240
so in the implementation that we have
been sharing with you here

399
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,240
well perhaps this methodology can be
modified

400
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:30,769
we're saying about the translation of
this data from one entity to another

401
00:42:30,769 --> 00:42:37,758
entity you can establish between them a
security channel of communication you

402
00:42:37,759 --> 00:42:38,599
know this

403
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:43,940
keeping keys in both of these entities
and encrypt the data as their

404
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,019
transmitted

405
00:42:45,019 --> 00:42:53,538
well if the server is sending clear text
data is clear the modified clients will

406
00:42:53,539 --> 00:42:56,599
gain access

407
00:42:56,599 --> 00:43:00,769
yes I got to go to hear in this case you
need to encrypt the data on the server

408
00:43:00,769 --> 00:43:01,640
side

409
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,118
send them to the game and then the game
will be busy

410
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:09,019
d decrypting it so it's outside the
scope this methodology

411
00:43:09,529 --> 00:43:16,369
now I'm gonna say is that I methodology
can be modified to accommodate that

412
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:19,789
it all depends on the level of
protection you want to achieve because

413
00:43:19,789 --> 00:43:25,880
we're not saying that our protection is
like a one hundred percent that our

414
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:30,049
answer sheet of the year one hundred
percent protection of course any

415
00:43:30,049 --> 00:43:34,430
motivated cheetah will be able to hack
it

416
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:38,149
the other question is how much time they
will need for that

417
00:43:39,869 --> 00:43:45,269
so here everything is based on the
premise or on our tools you're going to

418
00:43:45,269 --> 00:43:52,049
use for office location for signing even
these are tools that are too difficult

419
00:43:52,049 --> 00:43:56,339
to reverse engineer then you can provide
a good level of protection

420
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:02,730
so in this case the important thing is
that nobody should steal your key

421
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:17,220
thank you there's another question about
MPX the end plays the question is I'm

422
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:20,609
not clear how to write the code for the
end plates because as far as i

423
00:44:20,609 --> 00:44:22,980
understand it should be isolated

424
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:27,630
it should have dependencies to
third-party modules do you need some

425
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:30,630
special compiler for that how do you do
that in real life

426
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:34,230
for instance somebody wants to implement
it that in a game

427
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:39,839
how to use that i'm not quite clear in
terms of industrial development

428
00:44:40,499 --> 00:44:49,558
well let me paraphrase the name for EM
plays is sgx secure Gaiden extensions so

429
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:53,430
basically it's just regular code the
only requirement to this code that

430
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:58,529
should contain instructions just normal
c code without instructions affecting

431
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:03,599
the product of the process and world and
without put in there are some more

432
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:08,069
restrictions so it's clear that some
code with first thing that the compiler

433
00:45:08,069 --> 00:45:16,259
needs to know how to link its assembly
to place it in a certain region of

434
00:45:16,259 --> 00:45:17,160
memory

435
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:24,058
like for instance to do I don't know agx
compiler today accept any code compiled

436
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:27,390
by a regular compiler so it's just a
special components

437
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:30,779
no regular code compiled with the
special compiler with a

438
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:37,540
the rule is such a kind of Lincoln no
it's just loading special cpu mode that

439
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:43,359
has special entry instructions similar
calls when I know how it looks in

440
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:47,380
assembler in the assembly language but
what to do with dynamic memory

441
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:51,100
you need to have a special heap for that
or you can use the system here for that

442
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:58,900
I usual methods are supported for memory
allocation within the enclaves as far as

443
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:06,430
I know the only restriction is that I
think it's 128 or 64 guys a little bit

444
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,850
megabyte store for the system so special
API

445
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:17,109
no no regular APA so i can take some
boost can use a boost in the pee in a

446
00:46:17,109 --> 00:46:22,210
cup and so that will be in SG x or will
i need to use some special memory

447
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:29,470
allocator some special libraries for
that if you're writing code for the

448
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:32,740
enclaves you are using

449
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:39,368
lipsy stl libraries that arrive together
with the enclaves they taken from a

450
00:46:39,369 --> 00:46:45,940
regular is the importance of freebsd
lipsy so those functions have been

451
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:50,560
notified that are not supported by the
place such a screen print and but most

452
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,450
no you can't clamp

453
00:46:52,450 --> 00:47:01,540
thank you look you are saying that you
encrypt the data the question is what

454
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:04,119
happens if I modify your code

455
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:13,660
I'll patch it in such a way that is
going to always that the section of the

456
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:16,509
code that's being executed is always
valid

457
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:19,840
it's a good question Shh

458
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:25,750
I can add a small detail to the
description of our methodology trusted

459
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:31,480
code does not only does encryption
decryption it also does some useful work

460
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,730
something for the game

461
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:44,650
some mathematical something with magical
so correspondingly if it all gets office

462
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:49,930
skated for instance with an obfuscated
ER that generates a self-modifying code

463
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:52,240
then

464
00:47:52,240 --> 00:48:00,368
well firstly again everything is based
on the office cater refuse if you are

465
00:48:00,369 --> 00:48:07,359
saying that you are always going to
return the ok

466
00:48:08,109 --> 00:48:15,339
Magnus's then it's either you have that
some reverse engineering of the coach

467
00:48:15,339 --> 00:48:20,619
always just not calling the trusted
codes having thrown it away if you have

468
00:48:20,619 --> 00:48:22,000
thrown it away

469
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:28,599
we derive that this trusted codes
include some useful in computing without

470
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:30,220
which the game can't run

471
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:39,160
so it's worth mentioning or guessing
that's the true code should be executed

472
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:46,990
so therefore you should change the true
code but true code cannot be this

473
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:55,569
assembles you taking some returns
putting zeroes instead of ones

474
00:48:55,569 --> 00:48:59,109
so that's basically it so it's a good
question

475
00:48:59,109 --> 00:49:06,490
it's a good question yes you need some
useful trusted codes a valuable feature

476
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:11,109
that would do something valuable for the
game so that without it they coat the

477
00:49:11,109 --> 00:49:18,098
sort of the game couldn't exist with
this without this module may I ask you

478
00:49:18,099 --> 00:49:19,330
another question

479
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:27,700
thank you for the presentation i would
also like to know about the cheetah

480
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:34,450
detection method that can you modify
your answer sheets

481
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:39,009
- so much so that should identify the
cheat during the game and block the game

482
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:45,730
if it should happen within this
methodology you can't it just blocks of

483
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:51,670
the work of the cheat it becomes useless
to do what you want

484
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:59,740
you need to use some system based
features also just got this is too

485
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:05,680
and based on this information you can
get it but otherwise ok thank you

486
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:18,790
well the only thing we can block the
operation of our money we can notice

487
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:23,380
that's this is a lot of integrity but
it's in this case

488
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:27,759
nothing really happens is just passive

489
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:37,510
thank you so much for your presentation
and I now request you to pick two best

490
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:43,210
questions doin that you like the most
and awards of presence sir to their

491
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:46,210
authors

492
00:50:53,240 --> 00:51:01,819
yeah

493
00:51:03,109 --> 00:51:11,900
we would like to offer this gift to the
lady to leader thank you for the

494
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:20,119
question and to the gentleman with a
question what happens if we change the

495
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:25,609
module modify the module so that should
always return the ok statement

496
00:51:25,609 --> 00:51:29,869
thank you very much thank you
