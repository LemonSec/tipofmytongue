1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,350
teach us another winter is your shadow
much right now

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,769
it's a night in the western hemisphere
is the modernist writers of all invited

3
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:17,970
mafia is keeping the way

4
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,930
so good morning ladies and gentlemen .

5
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:29,820
hello venus and mercury from kaspersky
lab I here we have gathered here just to

6
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,000
take a look at who plays for the Mafia

7
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:41,430
the actual effects of the technology
which was developed all the recent years

8
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:55,230
nice fire walls etc can result in only a
very well-known application can i

9
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,230
launched use the internet is the truth

10
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:07,110
not really that's the view of the
whitelist the concept which has been

11
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:14,220
reincarnated in different ways you with
this year by community firewalls white

12
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,520
leases and applications we are not
perfect

13
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:25,710
illogical and the drugs and logically
you cannot split the black and the white

14
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:37,080
yes we did Charles really did you ever
try to get all the doors close to you

15
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,950
yeah yeah yeahs anymore I did

16
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,210
all I did

17
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:51,919
sometimes you failed nothing in the
childhood but now I done really well

18
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,650
developed a few criteria and martinis

19
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:59,119
you know if three applications out of
the white list so if there is an

20
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,050
application with a trusted certificate
if you download

21
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:15,150
malware you should be analyzed would
take some statistics we check what are

22
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,349
the applications connected to the
suspicious service and download

23
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:24,690
something they were trusted applications
section

24
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:33,450
what we ended up with was this the
result for a few months for detecting

25
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:39,988
approximately 30,000 protections from
different computers and servers located

26
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:42,810
or 90 from the world are

27
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,810
it's a global problem

28
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:53,349
we were trying to find out how these
applications turn out to be the airwheel

29
00:02:53,349 --> 00:03:03,849
thinking about the vulnerabilities
direct hijacking would wear found is

30
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:07,060
that a large number of applications

31
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:14,050
no whitelist for analysis where
applications years with containing the

32
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,380
browser components

33
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,380
one of the popular years you know models

34
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,000
you are you here his system remains
later

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,190
internet explorer components do you know
how it happened

36
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:44,780
let's get this . an actual factor in
this functionality and the erp systems

37
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,650
go

38
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:55,190
we think this analysis for their own
name is injected the cold into an

39
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,130
earpiece system

40
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:10,180
the system was going to post terminal we
hear those cards i will send to the

41
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:19,870
processing center and the copy of data
were sent to the hawkers hear from you

42
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:25,510
and your dumb cat version eight six
o'clock in the morning

43
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:31,330
they have been a still asleep I did
would connect to this address

44
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:40,690
download on 65 and how was it was not a
zip file per se

45
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,449
yeah

46
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:51,259
it was launched in an executive file a
good application sometimes

47
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:59,120
do not download executive files normally
date download scripts and I'm really

48
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,249
honest they launch another file a

49
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:14,840
with the dll files and for the both
movie file and trips and do not acquire

50
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:25,789
are downloading suspicious executive
files again he might be necessary on my

51
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,690
scale

52
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,690
well download a lot of files

53
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,690
and more files exact files and your name

54
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:40,350
well for some reason for some reason to
be somebody else the place with a model

55
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:49,650
and we're in the lies that you know the
first category was deed or supports he

56
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:56,789
does bought so far different types of
almost all of them you were made in

57
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,920
China

58
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,920
they're not huge

59
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,180
it was all the hostess the SQL server

60
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,730
I was watching the server yeah going
under throughput capacity was quite big

61
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:17,850
but it might be easy

62
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:32,780
it was in between there are no last
grills and also the data which is stored

63
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,780
at those service

64
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:47,240
it does the decryption and the utility
pop some of the server which allows you

65
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,540
to play with the database and they
exploit the role of vulnerabilities

66
00:06:54,350 --> 00:07:04,100
that's on the one on the other hand the
exploitation of vulnerabilities was not

67
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:09,410
the first one via for instance very
often

68
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:21,600
they used direct hide chicken instead
here and we detected a number of cases

69
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:34,050
one either download in we see
instruments populated even now if you go

70
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:39,750
back to them with mass media and how
direct I chicken is used there will be

71
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:51,300
going back to the incident investigation
with the D does bought so just sent here

72
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,490
for ddos attacks 2013 13

73
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,680
that was not they would brute force we
want

74
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:07,410
you know what you must be quite active
layer in 2015

75
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:16,380
there was some information that those
were the people who are usually dll

76
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:23,280
substitute methods you here is
substituted by the UDF libraries and

77
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,359
mysql so it was direct hijacking and
such

78
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,360
we all right let us think about that

79
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:42,799
we need to mention that it is a very
popular technique

80
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:49,880
along with the Chinese all of them by
using such methods

81
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:56,149
what does it look like there is an
archived with the executive file

82
00:08:56,149 --> 00:09:01,430
he and the dll file in it which looks
innocent

83
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:07,160
yeah but you know there's a trick in
there

84
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:16,310
it has a profile night it has a proper
export you know one problem exactly what

85
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:24,380
the file is launched shirt recognizes
the dll and download this just does not

86
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,329
look delicious

87
00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:36,349
animation or just blows this code from
the dll file the address space for you

88
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,040
mom

89
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,459
as far as you can see it

90
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,460
it does not really look like a very
malicious activity

91
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,310
this is a very effective solution and it
works

92
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:57,440
this is how all the heresy starts in the
system

93
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:05,930
number three and how the malicious
software gets into this list when the

94
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:13,400
operator the administrator the user is
downloaded in torrance with the bat file

95
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:18,860
inside a very popular case with
accumulated some statistics on

96
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:30,890
well applications from different lists
downloading malicious software from

97
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:39,319
India China and Russia all these three
countries are notorious for using the

98
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:45,020
free version self different software was
a cracked version of different software

99
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:53,290
by using payloads we figured out that it
was really popular in china chinese do

100
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,439
some doors bolts etc

101
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:05,650
he is this hijacking we walk in
massively yeah yeah

102
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:12,910
through those whitelist applications
that they either use d else or they do

103
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:21,699
not use exact files or the DLLs oh
really using scripts and the embedded

104
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:35,590
utilities and I they would still be
using some power shell and West scripts

105
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,700
to pull out some information

106
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,870
those of you who are warned to armed
protected

107
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:47,370
what do you do two more DLL hijacking
chicken

108
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:58,830
so first World analyze your software
hardware utilities applications that can

109
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:07,260
actually show the deal hijacks it still
remains a very relevant solution that

110
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:13,200
it's not exactly so we're on the
inventory and we limit these

111
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:19,500
applications their internet access
traffic accident where do we find the

112
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,660
magic bullet

113
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:30,990
white list defaulting on deny there is a
magic bullet there is such a solution of

114
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:36,210
laser technology and it's even affected
from the other hand we still have some

115
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:38,340
human error

116
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,320
you

117
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,520
we're going to use to purchase and was
definitely the correct way

118
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:50,390
how simply nice around mafia with the
city but to help the dancing around will

119
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:53,030
be 1 by peaceful citizens

120
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:57,890
thank you very much what processor

121
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:07,230
yeah

122
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:12,060
spicy was in serious and thoughtful
mystical think a lot like to clarify

123
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,649
this

124
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:16,950
about linux

125
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:23,160
do you have such solutions for linux you
mentioned into mysql but also related to

126
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:28,170
Windows you can do it

127
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,649
here it is

128
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:33,649
actual idea would be exactly the same

129
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,839
so infuriating

130
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:45,269
we don't have the real cases here thank
you

131
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:53,859
when each other

132
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:58,120
the quad what was both a coke addict
statistic a with amber color statistical

133

over from Christina pogo the worst ever

134
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:06,370
and Christina I came over somewhere
somebody with sits slightly to the

135
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,760
traffic um is not only on a teacher

136
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:14,258
sistema or which they're kind of pipes
much substance

137
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:20,799
I keep watching a movie with protective
about me just or interruptions in your

sunglasses but I'm websites for not for

rainia don't suppose it wasn't

141
