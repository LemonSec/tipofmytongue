1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,460
holly gets dressed which password for
mass starts

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,960
all right

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,900
breakout session

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:17,890
please take your seats and we're going
to have the biggest transportation

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,470
system in moscow moscow city

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:25,479
we're going to require just a little
time for all that it will not need any

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,850
special tools provided

8
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:41,650
smartform the an android nfc-based
smartform will do here i will briefly be

9
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:45,760
speaking about myself i had been
implemented and the automated

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:53,589
transportation fee charging systems for
10 years and normally thats related to

11
00:00:53,590 --> 00:01:00,730
the proximity cards are related to
transport payments have been involved in

12
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,269
a couple of projects in the country

13
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,050
I was the first to test NFC solutions

14
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:16,860
remember in 2009 line a telephone not a
smartphone to go through the turnstile

15
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:23,039
and the personnel there was quite
shocked not calling the police because

16
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,700
it was an unusual solution
transportation

17
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,490
payments transportation charges

18
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,710
I'm not widespread one hundred percent

19
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:40,210
they use my first technology in my phone
is a brand by an XP

20
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:48,820
it's actually combines a large number of
contactless chips

21
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:55,570
the one being my friend was six of which
you have heard in 2014 this technology

22
00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:02,619
is celebrated its 20th anniversary so
it's not a new technology and officially

23
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:10,508
those in fact back in two thousand eight
it was eight years ago my for classic

24
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:15,579
solution in the briefly and sometimes
people ask questions of what about the

25
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,360
battery

26
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:23,320
there's no battery and the card it's the
better less ship

27
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:30,549
it's exposed to the magnetic field
strong enough to power of this card to

28
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,550
provide data exchange was

29
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:41,460
it has memory which supports up to six
or eight commands and it splits into

30
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:47,280
sectors age sectors made up with a few
blocks by 16 provides the first three

31
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:54,690
blocks for user data the last one is to
locate a 66 by two keys and Lee and her

32
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,050
either write or read or read-only rights
etc

33
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:07,110
my friend go seek was hacked in 2008 by
using while the developers used security

34
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,380
through obscurity and provide early and
protocol

35
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:18,450
I will have to explain it briefly we
don't know

36
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:29,770
so the analogy is related to the Enigma
machine how it was hacked

37
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:34,930
when we send commands there is any
property place and there and one of

38
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,910
these data should be random but they're
pseudo-random so they're quite

39
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,989
predictable

40
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:48,280
so the students like in 2008 from home
and had reengineered the cryptographic

41
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,870
protocol where

42
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:56,720
i have already exchanged between the
bottom the reader and we all know Holly

43
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:03,980
Liam's solution for Fantastic Sams it
has some you utilities

44
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:11,480
there are plenty of handmade you want
bilities buy windows and we all know who

45
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:17,478
has under what taxes to with the new
chapter famous or notorious chinese

46
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:24,590
internet store and for fifteen dollars
you have a reader which supports I can

47
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,489
utilities

48
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:33,830
you can also acquire a special cards to
make clothes using my focus sick . a

49
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,830
unique number was divided

50
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:44,159
home which is in the member which you
cannot get the Chinese close solutions

51
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:49,349
allow us to this song so in 2009 the XP
company

52
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:55,679
the actual all power of the brand that
had released

53
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:05,609
am I 4 plus chip fixed the random number
sensor the Edit das support and they

54
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,610
left me my friend 26 emulations

55
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,290
the opposite direction is compatibility

56
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,650
so

57
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:20,799
what would be the mode that is it is
applicable here to my 4 plus 6

58
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:26,620
neither the integrator for developers
wanted to change anything

59
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:32,889
so the letters every night was the
biggest projects so i can still talk

60
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:41,110
about the origin here in Moscow by using
my phone plus chips but they're using

61
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:45,490
the micro classic principles and they
found a very interesting

62
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,948
reply are some of the officials and sane
people bought it myself

63
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:58,270
los cards and they wanted to do that in
order to avoid going down two feet

64
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:03,159
tickets but they left the same protocol
there

65
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,500
so how do we expose my blessing my phone
was sick

66
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:12,139
previously we could

67
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:18,800
not be moving anywhere the second the
cards actually quite competitive goal is

68
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,210
packed so we take a sniffer and we buy
it

69
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:26,229
something Indians in that store for one
hundred and fifty dollars and eighty

70
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:27,190
bucks

71
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:32,229
we do it ourselves on the internet there
are plenty of specs available how to do

72
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:33,849
it on your own

73
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:37,120
those who would like to economize can do
it on your own

74
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,770
and then we take a look at the protocol
we come up to the validator was so in

75
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:42,880
going on bus

76
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:50,620
we're using our troika card and we
applies for which is a small box and

77
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:56,380
then we go back through and while
drinking our coffee which is just three

78
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:02,290
minutes to process data with the
utilities available packet and get the

79
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,480
key out of the system

80
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,540
my story was about someone else

81
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,540
some time ago the bank in the school had
released

82
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:15,480
oh praise noi application we share

83
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,740
and I was you to acquire electronic
tickets woman

84
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,260
I was quite shocked at first

85
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:30,669
by the introduction of the other police
yes it's convenient but knowing how the

86
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:36,159
vulnerabilities are in Michaels think I
was quite surprised that they launched

87
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,870
it because we know that

88
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:42,849
take a look at the protocol you don't
need to go anywhere just to take a smart

89
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:49,719
for more with application is stolen and
it is used as a reader what I wanted and

90
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:56,470
further and I started thinking something
didn't you normal

91
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,710
actually now we can even do without the
day

92
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:07,060
hardware-based sniffer because knowing
their android-based sniffers principles

93
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:14,110
just going to use the key in the open
ways the open keys for the keys are

94
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:18,789
stored either in application of the
application gets the keys from the

95
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:22,090
server . by the international

96
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:27,460
we'd be compiled application and we see
that we don't have the keys there we

97
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:33,490
received my the internet so we need to
go through the HTTP traffic to pull out

98
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:40,510
the key is not the washer because it's
not a capable of coping with a co

99
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:47,890
so we use some proxy applications that
can decrypt the cell in traffic

100
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:54,370
we use the man in the middle attack
principle we put a certificate anymore

101
00:08:54,370 --> 00:09:05,620
we will decrypt the traffic and we see
the applications use the URLs read

102
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:10,029
transport car and we see the replies
using this machine

103
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:20,230
he's keys the second number value time
heart attack me is the key

104
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,230
that's what we have

105
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:27,650
had the power to the to the crippled
different models to have painted them

106
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:34,970
out so that you don't really understand
what the way to the actual here to

107
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:42,050
toggle and how do we do the triple we
take a look and it looks like we reminds

108
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,180
us about it at least 64

109
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:49,670
that's more to the encryption of is just
a little coding we have been coded it

110
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:57,740
was when you have a six light key that
we use to the card when we download the

111
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:03,380
google play with my free classic
application and more laughing our

112
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,730
assumption was correct the problem

113
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:10,500
in a very simple way without actually
using any hardware as sniffers

114
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:19,050
we have acquired he's to the transport
cards of the Moscow seek city rated

115
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:24,389
transit system and we use our rapist
transit systems here for free but I warn

116
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:34,019
you that it's a felony so please don't
do is remove what's the conclusion of

117
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:39,839
the conclusion would be that they trip
the protocol of the card is unsafe but

118
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:47,940
everyone keeps on using it because of
the various reasons and the application

119
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,500
itself is not safe

120
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,269
we can actually find other ways to
safely send the keys to the application

121
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:57,020
here you can start session so that

122
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:01,430
the time you limiting his have other
examples of other services in other

123
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:04,760
cities and towns they do it another way

124
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:10,520
as far as we're going to see to expose
the largest system we just need to have

125
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,500
an angel but it's not for me

126
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,500
and we have to have closed

127
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,990
you just need to spend a little less
than one in dollars and is it even a

128
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,580
schoolboy can pull it off

129
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,820
it does not require the specific
knowledge

130
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:30,950
I'm done thank you very much in another
you know the reminder once again you

131
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:36,140
should not do that and I'm open for
questions although i think it's so

132
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,850
straight forward here

133
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:44,810
yes please what about our q and A's

134
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,550
goddamn it

135
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,550
maybe some of you have questions

136
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,040
you know something i use pieces is what
you mentioned

137
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,490
so we have the anti-collision here for
you

138
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:04,400
it's not related to their

139
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:09,319
management and the collision so it just
choose one card and that's all

140
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,870
absolutely better

141
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:25,150
so basically we're talking about like an
explosion with the use of the readers

142
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:31,180
like to maybe a referring to today's
famous picture when there was one guy

143
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:35,020
the metro using the terminology

144
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:45,010
so you can use it some conditions you
can have thanked thinking cards because

145
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:48,520
i was just so you're referring to the
toy use case

146
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,800
it's a perfect

147
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,329
ok

148
00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:09,769
the actual fact the problem here is that
you're aware of the keys to that these

149
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:15,379
kids are diverse like you know in the
keys on one priority you know you

150
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:21,189
this from all the cards because the keys
should be diverse and each card should

151
00:13:21,189 --> 00:13:27,610
have their own specified key by hacking
one card will be able to go out

152
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,970
I need the key and to make clips

153
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:39,160
seems like that every hacker is aware of
this excuse that if the keys are on no

154
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,230
one if you don't have a hardware

155
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:45,730
if you don't know where to find such
money using you can do it in five

156
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:51,610
minutes time by just using your
android-based smartphone home

157
00:13:58,019 --> 00:13:59,170
yeah

158
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:02,380
that's right that's right you

159
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:07,420
that's exactly what they're doing and
commanded by tracking

160
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:12,480
got it it's not possible to do and there
is a time lag

161
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,329
we going to be about 24 hours and you
know how many your rights you can do

162
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:19,779
with 24 hours

163
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:22,880
Oh

164
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,870
they will be banned by the unique from
ID number

165
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:36,290
but you can actually take yet another
card and to just the same thing you do

166
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:42,110
exactly the same and you can buy and
spend 50 rubles for the card make a

167
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:54,770
clone and use it for as many rights as
you can do up to 1000 rubles of you can

168
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:58,670
find it even for less money and we're
such people find them

169
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:02,449
is a separate question thank you very
much i'm done i would like to give the

170
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,250
floor to the next speaker
