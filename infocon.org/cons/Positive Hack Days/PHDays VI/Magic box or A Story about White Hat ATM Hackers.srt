1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,230
cambria possible start a particular
situation

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:10,440
you wanna do is sleep a solution - the
club thank you very much for having take

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:16,770
one yourself way here to listen to a
presentation and it's would like to tell

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,350
you about how we had to make some
material Cena protected lang CL those

5
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:33,360
who have been at the presentations that
in previous bish days already would be

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,210
interested to know that when I work for
kaspersky lab we take different events

7
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,489
so it should happen at the black days

8
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:45,959
varies whichever you're welcome and
we're going to report them

9
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:56,190
so I mean work is to run the analysis oh
security and safety of different secure

10
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,739
systems and family in different ways to
start with I'd like to tell you what an

11
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,860
ATM is because as experience shows

12
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,950
not everyone has a clear picture what it
is

13
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,650
even people working with HCM don't
always know how they work inside an ATM

14
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,650
is basically

15
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:20,600
a Lego block for you know how big that
is

16
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:28,759
so there are all sorts of hardware
modules produced by all sorts of

17
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:35,270
companies they are put together in a box
and then you get an ATM

18
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:42,679
the top part of an ATM the core
so-called services on her cabinet house

19
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:52,910
a system book which is your looks or
almost the same as for desktops at home

20
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:59,990
apart from that there's a card reader
have been pad the CCTV camera and other

21
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:04,669
devices all devices are connected to the
system

22
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:10,728
look you didn't comment USB ports and
there are also older models may have

23
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:13,729
hated me another bus

24
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,410
the vendor believes that the service
zone is not about money

25
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:29,810
the service zone is a covered by some
plastic cover with just one lock and

26
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:35,930
each vendor for the entire line of atms
has the same block

27
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:42,470
some banks change them when they start
understanding that looks all over the

28
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:46,940
world in all atms of the specific
producer the same

29
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:51,800
some of them will change the logs of by
unique ones but most don't even think

30
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,820
about it

31
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:57,829
the lower part of the ATM is about money

32
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:03,590
so it's a safe box sandwich of steel and
concrete with two types of a lot

33
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:11,480
the safe contains all devices having to
do with the money with a cache of the

34
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:19,399
cash dispenser to dispense to my they
normally have for the cash cassettes

35
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,730
into a jessica sets each - go set
contains from two to three thousand

36
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:33,140
bills so therefore each ATM contains a
better 15 million rubles or maybe 10

37
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,079
million dollars or Euros

38
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:43,970
so you can descend that the attacker can
i benefit that value from just one

39
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,019
attack

40
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:50,930
so it's clear that and not always and
not every team has this much money but

41
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,290
this gives you an idea of the average
check

42
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:57,319
so to speak for each attack also the
safe

43
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:08,328
it contains a difference - in modules
now about software the system unit has

44
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:12,650
runs an operating system typically
windows

45
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:21,350
they also house to the main software
controlling the ATM the UI to interact

46
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:30,139
with the user and all right in the
engineer and collector and on the other

47
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:36,919
hand a module to communicate with the
processing and also the middleware

48
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:44,419
modules to control the hardware modules
of the ATM such as Kadri dispenses and

49
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:45,320
rest

50
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:52,520
also some banks they use different
antiviruses all integrity control

51
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:59,810
systems sometimes they install video
surveillance over the same unit

52
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,460
sometimes the you see strange things
such as a and obsolete

53
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:13,070
archive a backup system the observation
of flash player other curious thing and

54
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:17,930
I've calling them curious because they
have owners built yourself a well known

55
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:23,720
regarding the hard work it's all strange
and not easy to understand because

56
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:33,400
these are all the real time control was
that people love ID pro don't like at

57
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,210
all

58
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:43,450
so this is the schematic of a typical
ATM where we see that the windows based

59
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:49,240
application is the main a software that
controls the ATM that accepts commands

60
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:57,130
from the processor and lastly is that
the them through the hardware the the

61
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:02,950
XFS manager different event is called
them differently depending on them

62
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:09,280
the web but the entire software is a
picture of s compliance and this is a

63
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:16,150
set of specifications to simply find the
operation all for an ATM

64
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:23,799
regardless ill the manufacturer of the
standard was developed in 1991 started

65
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,060
to be developed by Microsoft and this
should basically give you an answer why

66
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:36,880
windows so using this excess manager the
main application translates the commands

67
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,440
the service providers to the different
drivers and then via the service

68
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,710
provider to the hardware dispenser in
pad and the rest of the status responses

69
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:55,090
or other responses to commands return
the same way just the opposite direction

70
00:06:55,090 --> 00:07:03,580
and yes you're going to love but the
windows XP is still used in ATMs some

71
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:11,020
experts say that XP doesn't exist that
embedded systems are used to in ATMs but

72
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:17,950
that very few some banks were in time to
migrate to windows seven really simply

73
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:22,750
you can still a find

74
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:30,220
ATMs are running windows NT and given us
to but the vast majority runs windows XP

75
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:36,700
as you can see any of our abilities
identified them later on we'll never be

76
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:44,349
fixed on the other hand there are banks
whose atms and run software and

77
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:50,530
operating system that is never updated
so once it's been installed the weight

78
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,059
runs and how it runs

79
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,300
Alexei my colleague Alexa will tell you
hi everyone

80
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:02,920
all were talking about malware XFS let's
now speak about a network the typical

81
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,130
atypical ATM network looks like this

82
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:09,400
there are lots of atms across the
country

83
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,890
maybe across different countries it's an
multinational Bank they are connected

84
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:19,090
through different technologies so with
the processing center but this is the

85
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,270
minimum that is required for an ATM to
rum

86
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:28,659
it would seem that it doesn't make any
decisions once owned the connections to

87
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,360
the processing center can be different

88
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,960
sometimes it's very easy and and
understood

89
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:42,190
x 25 and even it yes x i-25 still exists
and runs where you don't have anything

90
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,830
more than the phone

91
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:52,960
copper wire so if an ATM cause your
phone please don't be surprised you can

92
00:08:52,960 --> 00:09:00,310
respond even more popular our wireless
connections especially when it's about

93
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:04,959
remote connection remote location since
a small village

94
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,839
not too far away from

95
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:16,510
some company web work then it only takes
installing and industrial professional

96
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:21,880
modem and see it could see you as a 2g
or 3G network to connect to the

97
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,950
processing center on their own

98
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:30,580
it would seem that's all very good but
gsm/gprs modern modern so vulnerable to

99
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,450
attacks

100
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:36,280
basically these are the epic all the
technologies that have been with us for

101
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:41,860
more than 20 years most of you have
phones or sometimes more than one phone

102
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:47,620
you use the internet and everything
seems to be ok but other several

103
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:55,090
different particles such as a cdma GPRS
EDGE cdma is almost done

104
00:09:55,090 --> 00:10:00,010
there are not too many companies in the
world who continue using the standard

105
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:08,080
GPRS is the writing horse of the entire
industry and the standard of choice

106
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:14,890
using which had data sent from RT use
and controllers and whatever else

107
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:22,720
3g is expensive and you basically don't
need that speed setting from 25 to 35

108
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,340
bytes per transaction

109
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:29,350
you don't need a pipe like that as to
the encryption of the data

110
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:36,460
yeah it's it all looks pretty bad cdma
has been hacked along time ago and there

111
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:42,190
are companies who would charge you a
five to six thousand dollars to get a

112
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:48,040
commercial product that you can install
intercept any requests within the radius

113
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:54,969
so like 300-400 meters which is quite
enough for it to intercept control of an

114
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:55,780
ATM

115
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:00,819
re channeling a request for yourself gsm
is broken

116
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,930
first it's our colleagues from positive
technologies

117
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,410
I feel the reaper and I do not occur how
I

118
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:15,879
you brought the network up last year and
any user could connect to it

119
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:21,579
sometimes they made users to connect to
their . sometimes other and they were

120
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:24,399
sending some SMS some text messages

121
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,819
well it's clear that if you can send in
text message

122
00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:32,410
you can also use the internet connection

123
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:40,449
so basically once inside you'll be able
to connect to the approaching santa with

124
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:44,199
the mts and lt it's not that simple

125
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:52,120
there are still information that's not
not everything is perfect about these

126
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:59,470
technologies you can familiarize
yourselves with the presentations of

127
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:05,199
such people's garden and your sight of
who spoke at the american conference

128
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:06,910
last year

129
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:10,959
they're saying that not everything is
good and how a person that with no more

130
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:16,180
than 300 to 400 dogs in their pocket
they could get access to all the

131
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:20,019
sensitive information is clear that
banks are not happy about this

132
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:26,949
who would want that the date of the
customers should go outside to you

133
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:29,949
control that people

134
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:38,469
the thought of vpns so software hardware
implemented with the most popular copies

135
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:45,790
of the VPN that's not used so ATMs are
connected just like your own equipment

136
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,959
at home

137
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,410
some of them can be found in the
internet and all go

138
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:57,100
we'll talk about that later this
software is a split into the embedded

139
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,360
operating system and third-party
software because windows is used

140
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,559
everywhere

141
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:07,629
it's clear that the number of operating
8 operating systems

142
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:09,480
it's got limited

143
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:17,970
as to a third party OPN vpns there are
lots of them from cisco juniper any

144
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:25,019
other people but as far as hardware
support his consent

145
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:33,029
it's quite difficult to I didn't
separate it so you can actually

146
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:42,360
distinguish between the tools so that
operate inside the ATM and those outside

147
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:47,519
for instance if you look at that they at
an ATM

148
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:54,420
sometimes you see a modem next to them
and that would be exactly what i'm

149
00:13:54,420 --> 00:14:04,079
talking about the advantages of eps are
include the inbuilt a firewall so

150
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:10,410
basically if you don't know how to pass
it's all your requests so will be

151
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:17,610
rejected it runs separately and it's
good and bad at the same time if the

152
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:25,350
malefactor can attack the sort of the
ATM software they are not going to get

153
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:30,660
direct access her to the APN client and
it's a good

154
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:36,600
however thing that you may take
measurement hold in your hands but this

155
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,000
is also it's a drawback

156
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,920
if it did pay does not depend on the
operating system it can be in and it can

157
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:51,000
be held in a heads it can be taken away
and then he getting into some cafe with

158
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,980
the access to the internet get access to
the whole network

159
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:05,030
of atms of this specific bank where this
thing has been taken away from of course

160
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:11,569
it is not sold by physical access tools
with the software

161
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,520
it software implemented vpns it looks
like everything's good

162
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:23,510
they're cheap and easy to install you
don't need to buy a piece of hardware

163
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:29,840
before you can install it you don't have
to pay the salaries of the service

164
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:36,890
engineers and technicians and will never
break if ATMs about a break then there's

165
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:44,660
nothing to be done about that but if
ruta is broken then gets a similar to

166
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,140
like ATM seems to be up and running but
not working

167
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:52,069
unfortunately and not to be inclined
clients useful

168
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:55,280
quite often you can see that picture

169
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:01,970
well I in the ATM screen or wet for some
reason the connection goes down the VPN

170
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:12,230
tunnel goes down and the screen flashes
the window saying and you can't got a

171
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:22,460
comforting here working the all data
encrypted and containing use useful

172
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:29,630
information for malefactors such as pans
transaction parameters they will be sent

173
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:36,530
out and clear text so you just cut the
ethernet cable from the ATM connected to

174
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:40,459
your own computer and you're going to
see all the data in critics

175
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:47,060
these are some deadly sins that people
using ATMs either don't understand the

176
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:54,739
order quantity a software implemented
VPN is useless without the network

177
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:59,120
without the firewall the hardware
related one that does not

178
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:06,280
sustain the criticism using a wireless
networks into the paris air

179
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:12,429
well security system for them but
everybody's ignores that it's broken

180
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:20,168
it has been act people who come to say a
gsm was broken

181
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:25,480
they usually get an invitation please
break my phone break my social media

182
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:25,959
pages

183
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:30,429
unfortunately it all works differently
and if you really wanted it can be done

184
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:37,270
and the size of that desire is measured
by an amount of four hundred dollars and

185
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:42,070
then you get the gap between the
theoretical knowledge of a bank or

186
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:45,070
organization and the practical
applicability

187
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:52,330
well on paper the atms are perfectly
protected but in real life that either

188
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:57,908
badly set up because of the employees
are not competent enough

189
00:17:57,909 --> 00:18:06,789
what can be just too bad because of the
bid the tender was one in a roof using

190
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:16,240
some approaches that go beyond
aboveboard the ATM network

191
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:23,409
so you betta at ATMs are installed all
over the city all over the country and

192
00:18:23,409 --> 00:18:30,940
then we get to the situation where the
customer the back using it you want to

193
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:36,130
control them from a single point they
use such daughters either active

194
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,350
directory or something else

195
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:46,059
some vendors also allow the service of
upgrading the ATM software from a

196
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:49,450
central point but unfortunately even
they don't know everything

197
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,860
it looks like this would be a
point-to-point connection and what they

198
00:18:53,860 --> 00:19:00,850
get is like this fully meshed recitation
we break one we moved to another one of

199
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,959
the management server seems too

200
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,470
will be required but why would you want
to do if it's clear without it

201
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:12,559
so it turns out that we can attack not
the ATM itself and we may not be focused

202
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:17,330
on collecting money from its cash from
it but we can follow the principle

203
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,779
one for all and all for one but this is
just a theory

204
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:25,429
it doesn't look very exciting let's
consider how to break it

205
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:30,140
take a nap take the ATM scan

206
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:38,960
it's for the handbook vulnerability of
going button to the ages

207
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,880
it was seeing that the people ms 0 0 0
67

208
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:50,539
it would seem that everybody has already
updated and fixed it but the problem is

209
00:19:50,539 --> 00:20:02,750
that all ATMs are rebooted from the boot
disk and the people are not prone to

210
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,770
upgrade it to this because otherwise it
may break

211
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:11,809
so the interesting question of what
makes the left-hand screenshot different

212
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:18,440
from one on the right ideas in actual
fact there's no difference in both cases

213
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:24,260
we can run arbitrary codes is just in
one case we're doing it remotely is

214
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:28,610
sitting in a comfortable chair and far
away and the other the other hand -

215
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,639
we're just doing it right on the console
of the ATM

216
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,770
we have already shown it and
periodically event is and people working

217
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:42,049
with the atms are say well we haven't
seen this ATM

218
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:47,330
you've assembled it yourself I was in a
garage and done something that they

219
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,960
don't turn instead but although will now
tell you how it really happens in the

220
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,640
large world

221
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,610
yes this is a screen screen shot from
the video that we showed that black had

222
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:01,419
30 14

223
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:08,320
and now let's try and show how can
actually execute arbitrary code on the

224
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,310
ATM

225
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:14,350
if it's a known ATM that you are so
yesterday that you see today going to

226
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:17,800
see tomorrow we're going to use it

227
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:23,139
yeah he is here we have a situation like
him

228
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:29,920
well the bad guy as far as the key
somewhere and now open this service zone

229
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:38,290
that says he said is protected only or
with the plastic door they take their

230
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:45,940
hacker flash drive containing this code
take the keyboard that the Phantom has

231
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,640
put into the ATM with a false ID

232
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:55,900
you're nothing but there are seventh is
who do include keyboards in the kids of

233
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:00,760
the ATM to simplify the demonstration we
already got access to the operating

234
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:06,190
system but in principle if I some of you
have attended Sergei's Galanos

235
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:11,710
presentation where they see an example
of a real-life malware to execute

236
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,360
arbitrary code

237
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:19,750
so the malefactor got the first portion
of foreign money so they run the code

238
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,750
once again

239
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:38,049
gets another portion of foreign cash and
this may go to finish you

240
00:22:39,429 --> 00:22:45,460
so a West great atms can be found with
this amazing

241
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,739
and if you go to shadow them and if you
ask the right questions

242
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:56,860
it will see both the IP addresses and
the operating system and the

243
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:01,928
vulnerabilities that can be found all
the ports simply open and in certain

244
00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:02,980
cases

245
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,159
please take notes of some letters here

246
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:11,740
he may even understand where physically
of this ATM years and i don't know if

247
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:18,519
you can see it very well or not but I
yesterday scanning result is like this

248
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:24,340
so actually you can come here and look
around to understand which ATM was

249
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:31,000
either built or abroad here so I can
explain that in terms of unsecured

250
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:38,799
networks anyone that can get direct to
the ATM equipment

251
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:43,929
sandy kelan's too applications that will
translate it to the heart into the

252
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:49,059
hardware language but guys can use
simple just emulating emulators

253
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:52,899
it's so kind of a gift from the vendor

254
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:57,908
these are the utilities developed
specifically for the bank's engineers to

255
00:23:57,909 --> 00:24:04,870
understand how correctly the banking the
atms work with the processing is

256
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:10,658
organized but as you can understand
malefactors can use all this in their

257
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:11,620
own purposes

258
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:20,889
so it's not rocket science also as they
can create their own magic box from

259
00:24:20,889 --> 00:24:26,289
which the same commands and will emerge
they will be very much like the commands

260
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:30,490
issued by the real processing center and
again i'm not sure how well you can see

261
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:33,900
but this is the admin log

262
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:40,200
in the host base bank and it's just too
simple

263
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:47,160
so what's highlighted in green are the
third pairs of zeros and the last number

264
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:56,010
of 40 which means that the ATM has to
hand out of 40 sheets of paper is it for

265
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:04,710
well meaning the about 200,000 for time
and you need to don't want to get to 15

266
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:10,110
minutes to protect - <time> seven
</time> p.m.

267
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:15,479
so even if for the bank has seen
something and tried to respond to that

268
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:21,390
they won't be even time for people to
ride and this is another example of how

269
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:29,100
we can exploit or better to say benefit
from an ATM where we as a matter of fact

270
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:34,800
I found some rolls over VPN client and
something like that

271
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:39,090
well it's clear that it's the picture
thinking about test labs

272
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:47,459
no bank will want their logos to be
shown at this deputy's but this is a

273
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:57,750
true ATM the malefactor sees that zero
ruta and so the come up there and do

274
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:03,810
their dirty things taking the patch
cords of ATM from the root soon start

275
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:06,810
waiting until the ATM goes offline

276
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:20,149
well it so happens and tell it can
connect it to its magic box

277
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:31,820
I'm sure you're guessing which companies
and hear some small processing center is

278
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:37,129
implemented we are waiting until the
manufacturers waiting until the ATM

279
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:43,519
turns off line so it happens and now we
told me it works from this small

280
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:46,549
processing system next to it

281
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:50,418
what is her the ATM doesn't know
anything about it they don't need to

282
00:26:50,419 --> 00:26:51,889
change any settings

283
00:26:51,889 --> 00:26:57,678
another matter of fact that has arrived
with some cards it may be just a regular

284
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:03,200
a lot of the card from the grocery store
and they can do are all different things

285
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,740
that are supposed to be done by an end
user when the world to suppress some

286
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:09,740
money from the ATM

287
00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:18,559
well the actions are simple usual but
not altogether because periodically

288
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,340
we're getting screens here we don't
exist in the normal mode for instance we

289
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:31,250
can select from which to the set to pick
the money so waiting until the

290
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,820
transaction is finished processing while
the ATM

291
00:27:35,389 --> 00:27:45,889
squeaks and scratches with its insides
and their hands out if you

292
00:27:45,889 --> 00:27:56,090
Oh builds the check in this case can
contain information organ and smileys

293
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:59,090
all happy new year wishes and whatever
else

294
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:14,299
so this is the way how we can withdraw
any amount of money and from any card by

295
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:20,960
just identifying some ruta some
networking equipment all free access to

296
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:27,679
the bank's passport or again by getting
haven't get a-goin access to the network

297
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,070
either using some drawbacks some
vulnerabilities

298
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:55,730
yeah

299
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:01,158
yeah

300
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:02,070
Oh

301
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:05,070
particular

302
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,850
here we are

303
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:17,100
he's got access to the server zone yeah
it's a good time for him to do the dirty

304
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:24,600
job in many of instances we do not even
need to make it into the ATM

305
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:30,479
if we look around we will see unlocked
atms

306
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:39,210
well their own right well well there are
you can also see a lot of network

307
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:50,850
equipment and patch cords sometimes
engineers are so lazy that the a sick of

308
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:57,658
the years became able out of the ATM all
these pictures have nothing to do with

309
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:05,340
what the shop they're real life atms you
can see such an ATM walking along the

310
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:09,389
street you see if you say let's take a
picture of it

311
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,280
sometimes we invite friends to enjoy
them

312
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:22,200
well the first part was about networks
now let's see what can be done when

313
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,200
there is access to a USB port

314
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,600
sometimes we hear of from a security
people from banks very interesting

315
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:37,860
stories on monday early in the morning
while of clerks are on the way to the

316
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,580
office

317
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:44,428
cash on chat guys come to maintain ATM
they see them a locked

318
00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:48,480
they expect them to contain several
million rubles

319
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:54,929
but the money is not there they look
into log files records answering nothing

320
00:31:54,929 --> 00:32:04,320
there but there is a video showing the
couple weeks ago someone looking like a

321
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,679
maintenance engineer approach

322
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:16,290
the ATM open the strike zone with his
key place some box there looking like

323
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:24,120
around her then locked of the ATM and
left after that some people came looking

324
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:30,209
like customers clients doing something
them another guy looking like a

325
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,550
technician comes about

326
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:41,129
um no pedestrians react to him because
he looks like an engineer he unlocks of

327
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:48,540
the ATM takes of the save box and goes
away for security guys and cash from

328
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,760
transit guys it looks like magic

329
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,920
there is no magic at all at least on
this particular keys

330
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:03,300
what happened is a trivial story

331
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:07,980
the bad guy connected directly to the
device

332
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:12,810
how many of you heard about a black box
attacks

333
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:19,440
hi I'm happy to see here keep on
listening

334
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:31,290
the system module is designed to control
the device this small device was

335
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:34,710
connected it can be any kind of
controller

336
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:39,090
it is connected directly to the
dispenser instance of the system module

337
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:45,990
that's why there are no log files at all
because all the log files are based on

338
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:52,470
the system module which is not part of
this configuration anymore as a sub

339
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:57,480
the device was connected for comports or
USB ports we can send commands directly

340
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:04,830
to any device by passing this
intermediate software with his drivers

341
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:07,730
and so forth

342
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:10,850
with a card reader or we can use it as a
schemer

343
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:18,620
we actually transform our ATM into a
skimmer the internet we can find a

344
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:26,540
software-based universe install them on
certain ports and collect a track

345
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,250
playing tax information

346
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:37,790
scenario two we can come up we've have
any dancer or a PRP a and you sold a

347
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:43,130
hardware-based never in which case we'll
have a mac stripe tracker

348
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:52,219
we can also a collect data from DMV
chips in the tracker such a tracker is

349
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:58,250
enough to duplicate cards in those
countries where there is so now AMV like

350
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:01,580
the yes in some others

351
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:09,080
moreover if we obtain a pink else we
will be able to collect cash

352
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:19,790
these data are also sufficient to engage
in cash not present with Cardinal

353
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:26,420
present transactions and i'll try to
show you what can be achieved with

354
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:35,510
dispenser in a lab again but it is a
real life ATM the bad guy bought the key

355
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:38,270
online

356
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:48,620
the ATM is in the in service now that
that guy takes his box with the battery

357
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,630
and the jungle

358
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:56,510
it is connect the dispensers USB cable
from the system module and connects it

359
00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:01,040
to his device to his box small box

360
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:11,098
the ATM yourself in the service mode

361
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:18,570
it doesn't work it doesn't see the
dispenser however these pants are

362
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:23,310
continuous working of the bad guy it
gets going to actor to the Donaldson's

363
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:28,950
come out from a telephone handset or any
other device and waits

364
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,870
yeah

365
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:52,380
and here he gets some amount in foreign
currency are the bad guys pretty modest

366
00:36:52,380 --> 00:37:01,110
only taking a couple of notes real-life
bad guys will be keeping on doing this

367
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:04,350
as long you know there is space in there

368
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:14,700
Rex oh I a mentioned last year all the
disadvantages are working with com ports

369
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:21,569
the manufacturers say we don't use any
comports we use USB is but in the

370
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:28,320
previous example you saw a an example of
taking an ATM we are through USB

371
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:38,640
unfortunately it is very dangerous to be
alone in such situations either bankers

372
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:45,600
here you should know about bankers in
many conscious experience this problems

373
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:49,560
the question that how can this be
countered

374
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:59,100
how can we protect ourselves against
this well we are trying something but we

375
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:10,200
never managed to achieve the result that
we want the classical answer may be a

376
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,040
why don't you engage all those security
options

377
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,250
they are there for your protection

378
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:24,360
unfortunately people don't do it because
every next option can break something

379
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,420
when an ATM is out of service

380
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:32,220
it does not yield any revenue however it
cannot be broken

381
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:40,110
real Banksy we're a small down we have a
network or 100 ATMs but you're not alone

382
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:44,160
gets united with other people speak
openly about it

383
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:49,350
say there are problems out there you're
not expected to disclose this

384
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:52,410
information to the general public

385
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,390
there is still into banks

386
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:57,720
interbank interaction

387
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,720
there are various consortium

388
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:10,200
well unfortunately pci DSS is not a
silver bullet in the audience that I

389
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:18,118
carried out in order to get licenses in
the process transactions they don't help

390
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:25,529
to get rid of all the problems secure
process rather than result to maintain

391
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:32,130
those processes it is necessary to
understand things and analyze things and

392
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:32,970
of course

393
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:38,430
Proactive analysis is much better than a
incident investigation

394
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:46,078
once you have robbed you have lost money
knowing the problems that you face

395
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:51,779
you're in a great position to get rid of
them and you can be held by the various

396
00:39:51,779 --> 00:39:58,559
people and companies and don't forget
about guys are always watching you

397
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:04,140
they are always near if you're not ready
to spend money on security

398
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:13,230
be prepared to the switch off all your
ATMs remove them and run about to

399
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,309
collect your mind

400
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:18,539
stay safe you know if you have any
questions don't hesitate to ask um

401
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,779
yeah

402
00:40:30,779 --> 00:40:50,459
hi my question is about antiviral
software and say virus vendors create at

403
00:40:50,459 --> 00:40:59,038
hog software product for banks but as
far as a no as per skill lab does not

404
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,169
have such software

405
00:41:01,169 --> 00:41:09,359
some of them are come up with
abbreviated classical antiviral products

406
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:15,779
others come up with application
controllers saying that that is what

407
00:41:15,779 --> 00:41:20,130
atms need what do you think what's more
correct for ATM networks

408
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:28,169
we believe that it is better to hear all
the available security a method in place

409
00:41:28,169 --> 00:41:36,749
and ATM is a pretty fragile tool and by
adding anti-virus software to and

410
00:41:36,749 --> 00:41:39,178
integrity control software

411
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:45,959
well are overloaded it can be tackled

412
00:41:45,959 --> 00:41:51,328
I think that the company is offering
different solutions also offer solutions

413
00:41:51,329 --> 00:42:00,269
to various operation maintenance
challenges you don't keep your eyes shut

414
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:07,319
of the fact that those applications in
white less can also have vulnerabilities

415
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:13,619
on the integrity control systems can
also be bypassed the can also have

416
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:21,749
vulnerabilities such heels of the
country code execution of the White

417
00:42:21,749 --> 00:42:30,749
House barrier there is no silver bullet
and we should get closer try to get

418
00:42:30,749 --> 00:42:34,799
closer to the ideal situation boy making
small steps

419
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:42,970
we have to know my question is about
hardware gateways

420
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:55,629
how comes that of the can be sold near
ATMs granting access to bypassers why

421
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:59,829
don't people build them in a good
question

422
00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:06,309
unfortunately those who maintain a
champs are lazy people and we should

423
00:43:06,309 --> 00:43:10,480
remember about it and it's not
accidental

424
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:20,650
laying you cable in an ATM in such a way
as to make other devices or fifth insert

425
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:27,369
is quick labor-intensive process with
thousands of atms it will take quite a

426
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:28,240
lot of time

427
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:34,180
you can do this on some part of your atl
but some of them will stay vulnerable

428
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:39,940
the problems that we demonstrated to you
the examples that you can see on our

429
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:40,660
slides

430
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:48,069
they are exceptions to the rule of
however each of those examples account

431
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:54,520
for up to 15 million rubles of loss for
banks

432
00:43:54,520 --> 00:44:02,710
there is another challenge an ATM is
just a box made from iron but it's the

433
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:13,420
front panel is plastic and quite often
gas heaters are used to make this

434
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:17,680
plastic melt down to cut into those
boxes

435
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:32,180
we helped some day of bankers inform us
why they don't hide routers

436
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:40,220
sometimes they don't fit into ATMs ATMs
are not designed to accommodate routers

437
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,709
or coffee machines

438
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:53,300
however some banks in Seoul metal
enclosures Wheelock's aware they put

439
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:59,390
their equipment peripheral equipment
sometimes cameras but many banks just

440
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:03,770
can locate them and it is so the
question mark a

441
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:10,370
why of the don't come up with such male
enclosures have the bank's learned how

442
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:29,420
to counter people making a several Nelse
cutting several roads of notes just 10

443
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:36,230
there can be a while

444
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:43,010
yes of course they learn how to do that
and it's as simple as that one should

445
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:44,960
improve protection methods

446
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,890
previous lot of people would use worse

447
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:55,430
scanners to read machine-readable
properties today the situation is

448
00:45:55,430 --> 00:46:05,990
changing radial and every time of wheels
fraudulent well take note or whether

449
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:19,430
couple notes or a while the vendors
engage in improving the firmware to make

450
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:22,430
sure of that

451
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:29,560
of counterfeit notes would not be
accepted by the elevators

452
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:34,330
it is about updating your firmware but
sometimes

453
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:40,869
how do i upgrade very quiet no
microphone sorry for this

454
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:44,860
the answer is you're right

455
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:53,470
good afternoon a question from bankers
which is actually methods or prevention

456
00:46:53,470 --> 00:47:04,060
methods would you consider being better
a better protection against a black box

457
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:18,070
attacks and which tools are the best for
each of the methods of boys

458
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:21,070
I could dwell upon each of those methods

459
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:30,759
well i think that the best solution in
the most complex one is to impel some

460
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:38,710
pressure at all up ons enters to make
them improve their devices in terms of

461
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:40,540
USB protection

462
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:48,640
they're all so they can also be
additional hardware that can be provided

463
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:54,790
by a those maintain the atms to the
attempt

464
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:10,910
I forgot what I wanted to say you have
been talking about prevention have been

465
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:13,430
detection

466
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:27,350
well there may be a detection of thermal
devices dispensers can be disconnected

467
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:34,520
from house of communication channels can
be redundant very often of banks only

468
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:44,030
use their mouths and uh if the either
not interface is just connected the ATM

469
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:47,030
is unable to come the any information

470
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:53,480
Oh an ATM as the large piece of hardware
if it hit it with a hammer

471
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:59,839
all your sensors will go down very well
from banks don't even some engineers on

472
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:03,140
site in such cases which method is
better in your opinion

473
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:12,470
correct me if I'm wrong but you seem to
have broken of many dozens of ATMs

474
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:23,029
well i think that the most efficient way
is to a boot in a concrete enclosure and

475
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:25,040
something more visible

476
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,040
I think it should be a comprehensive
approach

477
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:35,030
there are a lot of vendors are a CEO of
protected data protection methods for

478
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:40,160
complex or USB ports but we know from
experience that they don't work

479
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:50,300
you shouldn't L pressure upon vendors to
make them offer protective sponsors for

480
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:55,580
the Spencer's not to accept any other
commands but only the commands from the

481
00:49:55,580 --> 00:50:02,240
main application and for those commands
to be only accepted if they come from

482
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,399
the processing center

483
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:12,950
some vendors already offer solutions to
prevent network attacks substitution

484
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:19,580
processing Mac authentication based on
some protocols SL

485
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:23,120
although pci DSS do not like SL

486
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:28,850
there are a number of measures that have
already been implemented but are still

487
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:36,589
not used by banks when we come to
analyze ATM or protection

488
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:44,690
sometimes we see pretty scary situation
people buying ATMs installing them

489
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:45,470
pushing

490
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:51,980
ok with no additional settings if you
look into shutter you will see there are

491
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:56,060
thousands of atms across the globe

492
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:01,819
although they shouldn't be there so they
should be in the am to any other

493
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:04,640
approach is quite a comprehensive
approach

494
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:09,859
it's not enough to check out all the
boxes

495
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:24,230
it should be a set of measures employed
on a regular basis and you of should

496
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:28,250
audit your entire ATM networks for
integrity

497
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:36,740
you know work we identify a lot of
vulnerability of expelling ATMs -

498
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:41,400
attacks on a fortune plan

499
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:45,000
thanks em where we have to learn
something happened

500
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:50,609
they are reluctant to engineers
proactive approaches where we analyze

501
00:51:50,609 --> 00:51:58,558
accidents when your Shone's out the bank
could have spent money on a full flash

502
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:06,569
few tests but they don't do that and the
bank me have some 500 ATMs in one city

503
00:52:06,569 --> 00:52:13,170
either reals the vulnerability on one of
them it is very much like is that the

504
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:18,839
same for the liability will be found on
the others are there any good figures

505
00:52:18,839 --> 00:52:29,339
good statistics that some of atms for
example may require a higher skills from

506
00:52:29,339 --> 00:52:32,099
the dead guys to the welcome

507
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:40,380
what kind of style do you want theories
or letters any banks or ATM networks

508
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:50,579
that are really well protected against
but with less problems we've unprotected

509
00:52:50,579 --> 00:52:52,049
trousers and so forth

510
00:52:52,049 --> 00:52:56,309
if you're asking is a bank client or ATM
users

511
00:52:56,309 --> 00:53:01,920
it's up to you you have to a look around
and try to understand if everything is

512
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,599
ok with this ATM

513
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:09,539
if all of the wires are on their place
with respective places i recommand

514
00:53:09,539 --> 00:53:16,380
thought you use ATMs that are inside
bank branches of course they can be

515
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:20,789
exposed to attacks too but I don't
recommend that here

516
00:53:20,789 --> 00:53:28,109
withdrawing cash from ATM sluts are in a
little blind alleys for example

517
00:53:32,069 --> 00:53:35,219
good afternoon my question is plain and
simple

518
00:53:35,219 --> 00:53:42,749
or is a risk insurance practice and
Russia for such risks

519
00:53:43,349 --> 00:53:50,489
good question is exactly what's used by
banks is their lashes worth that helped

520
00:53:50,489 --> 00:53:55,259
bank to protect themselves they
understand that should there be a

521
00:53:55,259 --> 00:54:01,170
robbery in some amount is Stone their
insurance company of wood right coverage

522
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:06,420
but they don't take just one thing into
account it is repeated over and over

523
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:07,199
again

524
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:19,619
insurance fees grow in confidence in
such bank of boils down

525
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:25,979
it's like with automobiles in a certain
point in time the insurance company will

526
00:54:25,979 --> 00:54:27,118
say no

527
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:32,519
you know the bank will be left with no
choice if the Bing goes to another

528
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:34,140
insurance company

529
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:39,299
there'll be high probability that that
other a company uh will also say no

530
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:47,670
the last resort would be a going to
somebody of ready to protect the atms

531
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:57,890
no microphones ruthless

532
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:08,119
yeah

533
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:13,960
ok

534
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:17,380
any more questions

535
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:28,060
thank you very much for your
presentation thank you president of herb
