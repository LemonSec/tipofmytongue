1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,790
simply via NASA on tumblr you are a lot

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,929
of companies where our pizza pies Nicole

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:13,440
Marie provision invested GT nutricai

4
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:18,600
company so we check we check the product

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:23,509
we will teach we train we train the

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:29,400
developers and I'll talk about how to

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:33,809
start testing security myself in my free

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:38,160
time I work with bounty and in the

9
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:41,250
evenings I I launch clusters library

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:45,029
Qyburn niches kubernetes kubernetes

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:49,820
clusters I do it in the evenings so who

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:54,989
works everyday with kubernetes who have

13
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:56,120
who has heard kubernetes so could their

14
00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:01,489
natures

15
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:03,750
so it may seem very difficult instrument

16
00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:05,820
complex instrument but it's a very

17
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:09,479
difficult system it's complex system

18
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,979
that's right and so when you come across

19
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,740
it for the first time

20
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:15,900
divorce admin developer tester doesn't

21
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,140
mean who you are so the first little

22
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:23,720
victory is to make the system work so

23
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,720
it's a complex system and it works out

24
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:31,320
so then some some settings by default

25
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,909
and security settings by default this is

26
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:39,630
bad if they leave them at default level

27
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:42,899
few words about the architecture so the

28
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:47,470
most important is the master mode master

29
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:51,700
node then the DVD storage there

30
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:55,090
and there so then cubelets is an agent

31
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:57,820
of the node that that manages the the

32
00:01:55,090 --> 00:02:01,380
launch of pods and that takes care of

33
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:05,169
their safety then there are cute proxy

34
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:07,780
so that handles the traffic and then

35
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:10,000
there are some pods with containers so

36
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:16,240
let's imagine that we have this web

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:19,750
application and it comes in the users

38
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:23,320
come so they they buy they do something

39
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:29,200
they visit sites so then the application

40
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:33,100
works fine and then so what what what

41
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:36,280
happens if not very nice guys will come

42
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:39,730
with bad intentions what will happen

43
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:43,060
then so let's imagine that this cluster

44
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:47,950
this web application and certain the web

45
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:51,310
application showdown and some socks the

46
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:54,850
people like so let's think that this is

47
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:58,090
vulnerable right for example so this

48
00:02:54,850 --> 00:03:03,359
command injection so you send directly

49
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:03,360
this command to operate the OS and

50
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,510
that's what happens let's see what

51
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,510
happens

52
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,660
for you to understand so the attackers

53
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:38,830
so they send a command for the return

54
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:41,680
shell and and then at their own server

55
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:45,610
they open up the port and wait for the

56
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,530
connection and then they were through

57
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:50,170
web application and they get the

58
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:52,950
connection of all neural connections so

59
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:58,839
the attacker is inside the container and

60
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:59,589
now he knows where he is what he does so

61
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,970
what

62
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:11,379
so then what he can do so see the files

63
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:13,510
and see the files were just rights and

64
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:16,839
all about vulnerabilities so then the

65
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:19,570
zips and in to be shown and then the

66
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:21,369
attacker has a different task since he

67
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:24,280
understands that he is inside the

68
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:29,410
cluster he needs to follow through on

69
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:31,659
his attack Kim CTL that he'll make that

70
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:35,110
that allow us to communicate with the IP

71
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:41,669
server and the attacker downloads from

72
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:41,669
the server and checks there's a file

73
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:54,090
gives you the rights so the rights are

74
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:56,638
given granted the rights then by default

75
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:59,128
kubernetes

76
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,460
I also provide secrets of this service

77
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:07,219
account into the pod and you can easily

78
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:10,680
find them that's exactly what happens

79
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:12,810
and then the effect I found that there

80
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,569
is this he found this and this you can

81
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:18,509
see on the screen there's a certificate

82
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:21,900
and key for the connection to the

83
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:24,180
cluster and informing the command for

84
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:27,960
the keep city and the certificate opens

85
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:33,629
up this token the token looks like

86
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:43,859
Judith 64 then stores it saves it a

87
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:47,969
certificate and token so were to go grab

88
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:52,529
burn em burn HS and defined IP and the

89
00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:55,949
port where you need to go then the rest

90
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:59,069
is easy so I keep CTL is one of the main

91
00:05:55,949 --> 00:06:01,379
instruments they form a command IP

92
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:04,259
server identified certificate key

93
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:08,190
identified and get one simple honorable

94
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:11,039
and then you get into a space where all

95
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:21,000
these nice socks cards front them

96
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:23,759
everything so then you can see all the

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,520
parts everywhere called the Netscape

98
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,580
system everything and the socks and the

99
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,878
sock shop so where the attacker found

100
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,878
himself

101
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:41,759
and then attempt number two so then

102
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:45,990
first a service account so there's

103
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:49,199
rights exactly then you see naturally

104
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:52,310
that you can go further so that the

105
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:55,199
attacker comes and says we have some

106
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:57,630
some bias miss something good maybe I

107
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,599
should go and see those bars where

108
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:06,289
device were made and then he goes into

109
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:13,710
the pot with all orders purchases

110
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:18,000
sensitive information data data the data

111
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:19,549
file and then and then he he doesn't

112
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,889
stop already

113
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:26,669
gets to the other spot I can find

114
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:29,580
accounts emails accounts cards if they

115
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:32,780
go forbidden there so even if they're in

116
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:34,560
krimpets United incident incident anyway

117
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:37,628
and

118
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,629
[Music]

119
00:07:49,690 --> 00:08:00,500
what happened so this bad guy came yes

120
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:06,710
so then I found this vulnerabilities

121
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:10,550
went to pod also found secrets chapters

122
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:13,849
download CTL downloaded and went to the

123
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:17,360
master and then found more interesting

124
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:22,150
part so where the sensitive information

125
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:26,900
is is is available about the socks from

126
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:32,140
and he got the access to the shop and

127
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:32,140
all the information what's next

128
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:50,160
what else could have been done hmm could

129
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:53,869
be done okay we're still there and the

130
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:57,809
frontality now more interesting things

131
00:08:53,869 --> 00:09:00,230
are going to happen so they use the

132
00:08:57,809 --> 00:09:04,019
yellow file for different operations and

133
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:07,559
I am filed which which shows that it's

134
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:20,040
upon and then the images used in jigs

135
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:26,059
and then what's next so it takes the

136
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:26,059
directory and mounts it onto a host

137
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:36,389
what's going to happen why he's doing

138
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:42,119
that so I'm very accurate slow reliable

139
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:45,379
hacker checks every step and he launches

140
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:50,100
the command to perform yellow file

141
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:52,980
create support attack pod Creed

142
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:57,330
and then we need to wait until port is

143
00:09:52,980 --> 00:10:00,570
created the containers go away then he

144
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:06,300
has exact rights and he gets into the

145
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:09,240
attack pod and he can see the file

146
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:13,140
system of the node where the container

147
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:15,570
was launched in the pod more interesting

148
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:18,830
so there are the secrets of the server

149
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:21,750
already available to bleed disabled ECG

150
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:25,310
so using all the data I can actually

151
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,310
grab the server

152
00:10:40,380 --> 00:11:33,310
okay let's play the thought went to the

153
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:36,940
IP server master note to use the

154
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:40,839
dashboard dashboard this is dangerous

155
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:42,700
it starts with images and a close down

156
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:48,700
your dashboard everyone says but there's

157
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:52,150
no company's sound like web the

158
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:55,120
terminals dashboard and they keep it

159
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:56,920
there both inside the network so here

160
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,650
the attacker through the web application

161
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:05,729
gets into God and then he cannot go

162
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:08,560
further these settings do not restrict

163
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:10,660
him you can go to dashboard to see the

164
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,329
scriptures or pods that is safer for

165
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:16,540
even launched their own pods through the

166
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:21,310
dashboard but for this Ian sqrl that's

167
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:24,849
it and the knowledge of headers the same

168
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:28,030
with CD CD in old versions by default it

169
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:31,650
was decrypted and the access was open so

170
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:34,569
now it's better now but still it was

171
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:37,890
connector this EGCG defined all the

172
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:43,360
secrets description of parts variables

173
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:45,189
internal and hand points anything and to

174
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,060
see how cluster was built and found

175
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:50,100
tutorials

176
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:51,680
he will talk about cloud providers this

177
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:55,230
is a Google Asia

178
00:12:51,680 --> 00:13:01,620
digitalocean Amazon naturally so they

179
00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:05,820
provide their clusters but but for some

180
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:08,970
reasons so you can go to from portal

181
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:11,399
metadata and use metadata and drag and

182
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:14,029
steal the data and have to take away the

183
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:18,839
data can read all the security secrets

184
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:25,100
find this easy CD secrets and to get to

185
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:27,360
the inner sanctum of all the clusters

186
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:31,070
what have they found

187
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:40,410
you said kubernetes is a new product and

188
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:44,240
so then in 2016 appeared this is the

189
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:48,050
statistics of identified vulnerabilities

190
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:52,050
so then December 2018 when the

191
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:55,410
Commonwealth to upgrade the clusters so

192
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:58,050
they found a mistake in the end oh the

193
00:13:55,410 --> 00:14:00,360
logic of the processing of IP queries

194
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:03,359
that allows the attacker authorized

195
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,070
unauthorized to get access and to

196
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:10,079
increase their privileged preference and

197
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:13,579
privileges address of Cuba server

198
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,579
there's a gothic connection

199
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:22,769
query and then to be rejected others to

200
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:24,810
send queries the same connection and

201
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:30,360
they would go to backstory straight to

202
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:32,959
the nose and that allowed to to grab the

203
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,959
whole cluster

204
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:39,660
at the beginning of this year February

205
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:44,638
this year more difficult there's a keep

206
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:48,540
city HCP copy command by default if you

207
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:51,000
not to copy a container file it does it

208
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:55,050
they take the tar from container this

209
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,920
file and then archives it but what can

210
00:14:55,050 --> 00:15:00,750
be done if you replace dark appeals

211
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,300
network does not check if the difference

212
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:08,819
that that tower and instead of tar you

213
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:15,479
can just put in a symlink script shell

214
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:17,849
to head and scripture and then you do

215
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:21,120
things and then they come together to

216
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,199
that means and then debug doesn't work

217
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,560
help me

218
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:35,250
download the bug look and see what's

219
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:39,989
happening coaster operator out there

220
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:43,290
Loudoun see how they exploit this

221
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:47,190
vulnerability to to entice you as the

222
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:49,349
cluster iterator today to the of the

223
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:51,889
network and it's worth workstations and

224
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:54,420
the workstations there were more secrets

225
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:59,010
that you could get access to that could

226
00:15:54,420 --> 00:16:01,439
include minor death and so then to make

227
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:06,060
a command to send some information from

228
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:08,630
his and then that's that's that's how he

229
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,630
could do

230
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:17,710
what I'm driving at so it's our

231
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:19,719
mentality or not so because this

232
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:27,000
temporary things are very constant as

233
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:27,000
you know I will just I will do it later

234
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,850
using settings by default default

235
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,910
settings so this is very bad because it

236
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:39,850
might hit you in the back and so if you

237
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:47,260
forget about security and if you use

238
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:51,130
only default settings successfully if

239
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:56,790
they attack they're exploited here at

240
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:56,790
the beginning of the I became interested

241
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:07,448
kanji eraser searches they found some

242
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:12,010
things passport cards and they found

243
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:18,190
everything and I became interested so

244
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:20,920
other public clusters yes there are so

245
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:23,170
why on the face why should you open the

246
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:39,580
access to cluster for the whole world

247
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:42,130
and I watch clusters and went to sleep

248
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:45,250
and the others just are working on them

249
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:48,160
so the rest of the debug moments there

250
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:53,020
are some initial stages to get to earn

251
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:55,600
about technology more and then then this

252
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:57,790
cluster is vulnerable open because it's

253
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,659
being developed and this is bad and then

254
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:04,450
it could be taken full advantage of

255
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:05,440
because because they they put everything

256
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,600
in there

257
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:13,270
so this is an open door to the

258
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:16,110
infrastructure the rest when it's

259
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:21,340
Shradha when they show them some API

260
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:25,750
limit limits and and and and port at

261
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:29,500
thousand 250 so that works on a secured

262
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:36,100
connection ssl true and if you do HTTP

263
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:43,300
IP 2250 then you will see 404 that's the

264
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:45,340
query result so I hope the number of

265
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,180
results would be great now but it's

266
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:50,379
increasing

267
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:56,910
so then 660 500 added in the last two

268
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:58,120
months so I like showing guys that edct

269
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:06,310
atcg

270
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:10,350
so 2,000 homes support 2379 not all of

271
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:15,639
them just go in and see the majority

272
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:18,820
open a closed secure but nevertheless if

273
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:23,230
you filter short by the same standard

274
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:26,200
organization region then you can you can

275
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:30,250
narrow down answer again you'll see what

276
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:32,820
kind of car companies operate the city

277
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:37,050
they are exposed to the home

278
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:39,510
and then I thought maybe we shot that

279
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:45,570
automate something and I automated it a

280
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:48,170
little bit I like to automate cubone

281
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:52,050
cubone

282
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:54,720
just the right from cube let me know

283
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:58,169
what is what is the kind of utility is

284
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,890
it four stages looking for clusters of

285
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:01,440
shoulders

286
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:06,800
storing addresses or develop analysis

287
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:14,270
white cube off works only with the 10/22

288
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:16,800
10250 port and and besides for 10250

289
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:19,320
there are other interesting words where

290
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:26,340
the attacker may find sensitive

291
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:29,909
information for 10 5 2 5 5 so this read

292
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:33,530
only 43 you can build anything but you

293
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:36,510
can read spare clusters a container laws

294
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:43,350
mattresses and all this information is

295
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:46,650
very good for the attacker to prove the

296
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:51,679
vulnerability of the cluster so we need

297
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:55,020
at least one working and then keyboard

298
00:20:51,680 --> 00:21:00,660
execute command inside the container and

299
00:20:55,020 --> 00:21:03,810
then he hit parses so if you take URL

300
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:06,270
and send it to this port to 10 12 to 15

301
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:08,310
and you'll see the pods that are

302
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:12,389
launched up and running right now you

303
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:17,190
see containers that are working at this

304
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:22,580
time and if you said that so then you'll

305
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:22,580
see the whole list of pots then we check

306
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:29,509
and by thunder the containers the

307
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:31,820
containers and then we went then the

308
00:21:29,509 --> 00:21:34,460
command to launch so this as a

309
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:38,539
description like in running pods

310
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:45,739
so this long long line is is the name of

311
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:49,220
the pods cube system and container cube

312
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:52,129
control manager so cue ball does not

313
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:55,970
move for a specific name space does not

314
00:21:52,129 --> 00:21:59,649
look for specific Bolton container it

315
00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:02,269
just takes the first one because by

316
00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:05,268
default it rotates the results if you

317
00:22:02,269 --> 00:22:12,830
update the page so it generates new set

318
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:23,559
of information how can you do it with QQ

319
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:26,599
you seen URL so the cube system and then

320
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:30,830
cube controller manager or a know what

321
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:34,849
name and then cube controller manager is

322
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:38,299
the company so the ID command has post

323
00:22:34,849 --> 00:22:39,979
post dated nothing extraordinary if

324
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:47,200
everything is successful you will see

325
00:22:39,979 --> 00:22:47,200
this this list you will see this list

326
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:53,120
I'll show you how it works

327
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:13,249
[Music]

328
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:16,238
I want to warn you that when you execute

329
00:23:13,249 --> 00:23:19,489
any commands on someone else's resources

330
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:24,080
so you could be punished one day if you

331
00:23:19,489 --> 00:23:37,999
have no no no no permit for that so when

332
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:43,009
you want you to always remember to find

333
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:45,070
zero filtration and shuttle afford for

334
00:23:43,009 --> 00:23:53,210
organization operation

335
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:56,629
Ida faced IP trodden goes in and finds

336
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:59,989
three nine nine nodes that detection can

337
00:23:56,629 --> 00:24:04,759
reward me I did ID command and you can

338
00:23:59,989 --> 00:24:20,779
she asked you out let's calculate 392

339
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:28,219
host almost so ages too much I don't

340
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:32,450
know this is seem too many or little but

341
00:24:28,219 --> 00:24:36,849
if we practice responsible approach talk

342
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:40,700
so the attacker needs only one if he

343
00:24:36,849 --> 00:24:43,639
can't deform God get to the note he may

344
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:47,200
actually check this system and that's

345
00:24:43,639 --> 00:24:47,199
what's that's scary

346
00:24:52,700 --> 00:25:00,059
so again this marine battle so someone

347
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,129
has come he doesn't hit a web

348
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:08,129
application he has discovered that the

349
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:12,720
cluster is in in the internet or 10250

350
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:16,470
and and then again the same he would do

351
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,450
he would fulfill the commands inside the

352
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:23,660
container and the same thing now may

353
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:23,660
happen so you get to the dashboard ECG

354
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:30,570
it's not very difficult for is a

355
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:34,020
attacker but then I automated that's

356
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:40,139
good I played the Rosetta I liked it so

357
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:46,740
wide for one reason so along with q-ball

358
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:49,920
zero other larger useful utilities that

359
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:52,559
help to estimate the security and the

360
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:54,240
setting so DNS cluster q-ball is needed

361
00:25:52,559 --> 00:26:00,149
as another line in your security

362
00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:02,760
pipeline you just know you may get

363
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:05,790
public cluster in the if they are

364
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:07,830
protruding and sticking out and close

365
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:10,740
does it's on right now we're all people

366
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:13,889
we all make mistake on this line may you

367
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:18,260
know a failure one day if you find such

368
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:21,809
a cluster and call your security guys

369
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:24,570
just do it under so why does it happen

370
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:26,649
why does it work where is the magic

371
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:29,889
magic is simple

372
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:31,779
so in the source so there are two

373
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:35,820
functions get run

374
00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:38,409
that's why cubot works and get exactly

375
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:42,549
so one of them is going to become a

376
00:26:38,409 --> 00:26:45,490
legacy but it doesn't because anyway

377
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:49,029
there's only one of them get exact works

378
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:58,510
differently at least you will require so

379
00:26:49,029 --> 00:27:00,190
cat cat and Heather so you just do what

380
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:02,710
you see on the slides you do the same

381
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:08,260
thing if it is successful you will get I

382
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:15,460
should it be 302 as a negative residence

383
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:20,289
and you take this key and then add it to

384
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:24,940
the ID command so let me tell you about

385
00:27:20,289 --> 00:27:30,039
some stories from real life Cisco so

386
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:35,340
let's talk about Cisco earlier this year

387
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:39,129
I encountered a wonderful TCG cluster

388
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:44,260
that was giving me many interesting

389
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:49,360
things when I tried to find out who it

390
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:52,000
was when an attacker gets it gets and he

391
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,760
still in Amazon how can you find out who

392
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,120
is that it's some kind of cloud of

393
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:01,779
provider it's a cluster in my view one

394
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:04,330
of the simplest way to find the engines

395
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:06,700
is to find it jinks and then description

396
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:08,720
of the hosts hosts and understand who is

397
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:11,580
that

398
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:15,210
in differently if it is not a cloud

399
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:18,409
provider and the network is in data set

400
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:21,380
just take a local BSN and this IP

401
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:26,730
address was in the same system with the

402
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:31,320
main Cisco site what happened such

403
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:34,640
beautiful things default cluster and

404
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:39,809
tokens from Cuba DM and you can use it

405
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:43,260
to connect your node and then there were

406
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:46,080
hash passwords doesn't matter that it

407
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:49,230
was hash dollar six five one two but

408
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:54,590
these passwords were known so there was

409
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:58,080
no need to use magic and still after I

410
00:28:54,590 --> 00:29:04,139
wrote about this IP address

411
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:07,199
I asked within 24 hours after talking to

412
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:09,540
Cisco I realized that they know about

413
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,890
this vulnerability on the 5th of January

414
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:16,889
as I sent it to them probably because it

415
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:20,220
was some critical system their internal

416
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:25,140
system they fixed it this IP address and

417
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:27,540
seven others and at the port 10 2005

418
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:31,370
there was something else description of

419
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:31,370
the pause with all their variables

420
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:39,009
they were secrets you don't you just

421
00:29:34,479 --> 00:29:49,119
opened this idiot joystick you'll find

422
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:53,820
secret internal points and parameters so

423
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:59,668
it was a huge sis complication they were

424
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:59,668
many endpoints internal and external

425
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:09,070
[Music]

426
00:30:06,149 --> 00:30:11,168
they said nothing works but actually

427
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:13,239
there were some external hosts working

428
00:30:11,169 --> 00:30:16,149
and after our reporter they have closed

429
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:18,399
them down but still and there were other

430
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:21,248
interesting things but unfortunately I

431
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:23,758
didn't work closely with them you know

432
00:30:21,249 --> 00:30:27,220
this is centralized a secret storage

433
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:39,039
keeps of all the secrets in one box very

434
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:40,929
cool and protected there were secrets if

435
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,239
you take those secrets get into the pod

436
00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:44,979
and get to the note you get the pretend

437
00:30:43,239 --> 00:30:49,769
to be an application and get all those

438
00:30:44,979 --> 00:30:49,769
secrets that are available for this role

439
00:30:53,600 --> 00:31:01,949
so you can always state the cluster and

440
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:03,870
actually see what kind of hardware you

441
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:10,770
have a disk lustre what's interesting

442
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:15,239
and you know how it happens I imagine

443
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:17,700
those miners who mined in the evening

444
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,980
looking for resources they have this

445
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:24,330
automation they go to these Port Salut

446
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:30,120
prospects look for fat nice servers and

447
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:34,080
clusters and just attack them even

448
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:38,520
industrial IT Giants I may be wrong yeah

449
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:41,129
no rocket science it's that thing called

450
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:46,860
the digital network architecture Center

451
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:48,690
unauthorized access vulnerability there

452
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:52,860
was much information because the

453
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:56,660
password was weak and it was not secure

454
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:56,659
you can go and read about it who else

455
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:07,169
right empty AT&T unique University of

456
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:10,890
Arizona and this Chinese I thank God I

457
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:13,650
didn't go there but others got it very

458
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:18,510
funny I told about it

459
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:24,410
those clusters once you try they give

460
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:29,520
you this type of in the infrastructure

461
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:32,130
it seems to be oh and there was nothing

462
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:36,780
else to try but turned out wrong

463
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:39,809
remember is a cloud provider who gets

464
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:41,790
his post to metadata and when you have

465
00:32:39,809 --> 00:32:44,149
an IP address and you want you don't

466
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:46,428
know who and what is that

467
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:49,700
and for automation is convenient to use

468
00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:53,360
Asia pleasure they give you this and

469
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:58,279
pointer you are insert their IP address

470
00:32:53,360 --> 00:33:01,668
that you get and see that it's that you

471
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:04,039
look at it and then digital oceans good

472
00:33:01,669 --> 00:33:07,520
guys they recently launched their own

473
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:09,470
cue brunette custards so when you have

474
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:13,340
this master notice somewhere else you

475
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:19,279
don't have much access but in the courts

476
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:24,459
you could deliver wonderful secrets you

477
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:24,460
take the private certificate and you

478
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:37,010
bastard and my favorite Google they are

479
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:40,039
amazing metadata flavor without this

480
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:45,559
together you will not get anything but

481
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:49,580
if you do it you can get the same thing

482
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:51,649
for cubelet and again then you get nodes

483
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:54,549
and codes and secrets and whatever you

484
00:33:51,649 --> 00:33:54,549
want you launch

485
00:33:56,230 --> 00:34:07,570
and another summary so once he found the

486
00:34:04,149 --> 00:34:13,000
cluster he he look at the cluster in

487
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:15,520
kubernetes so when he wished and typical

488
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,119
vulnerabilities and tried to exploit and

489
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:21,759
then it goes as usual first you launch

490
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:24,429
the container and the nodes and then the

491
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:28,030
intelligence inside the system bug

492
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:32,560
bounty you must have heard about a

493
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:35,649
wonderful case with Shopify for twenty

494
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:42,040
thousand five thousand dollars what

495
00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:45,638
happened there was a web application did

496
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:47,349
Shopify screenshot and it looks like

497
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:52,750
give me a screenshot and smart people

498
00:34:47,349 --> 00:34:55,119
inserted this line generating the end

499
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:58,270
got a default token and then we took

500
00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:03,130
those talking we insert in the header

501
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:05,800
and go make an enquiry and they get a

502
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:13,060
response with a certificate a private

503
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:16,710
key and then it is simple we take the

504
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:20,740
cube CTO certificate and the token and

505
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:24,760
according to Shopify for most of the

506
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:31,299
shops you would go and see was there

507
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:33,320
why 25k bounty is not a payment it's

508
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,680
simple

509
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:38,530
[Music]

510
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:43,600
according to Shopify this cluster was 44

511
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:46,630
development but feels they were real

512
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:56,140
production cluster real users real cars

513
00:35:46,630 --> 00:36:03,940
the real payment that's why 25k why is

514
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:08,290
it dangerous you all heard what house

515
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:11,109
Tesla burned their sport after that we

516
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:15,369
got the phrase don't be Tesla close your

517
00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:19,690
dashboard so attackers were smart what

518
00:36:15,369 --> 00:36:22,840
was interesting about the dish some

519
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:25,600
secrets that allowed to launch in the

520
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:31,270
cluster miners with minimal resources

521
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:38,859
not to get burnt miners communication

522
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:42,750
they used they used command servers and

523
00:36:38,859 --> 00:36:46,600
thanking servers they used it totally

524
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:51,460
they hid the real IP addresses so any

525
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:57,850
ideas EPS most probably has addresses

526
00:36:51,460 --> 00:37:00,550
and it works well for mining

527
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:03,040
unfortunately we don't know how much

528
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:07,510
they mined but certainly a lot because

529
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:10,800
Tesla had big resources Aviva is a

530
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:14,260
British insurance company a large one

531
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:19,480
good player in the market and you see

532
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:26,200
the dashboard was hacked and they came

533
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:29,770
in and asked for a pod you see the way

534
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:33,450
as far as I know it's manera and then

535
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:36,670
you could see how much of they mind

536
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:41,169
another find unfortunately I cannot tell

537
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:46,990
you who is that just like in bug bounty

538
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:49,030
there are kilometers of report they will

539
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:52,000
just fix within one day and keep quiet

540
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:56,619
it's a large College in a large country

541
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:01,390
a lot of big continent it's a Jew the

542
00:37:56,619 --> 00:38:04,359
men age eg why I was walking across a

543
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:07,080
lot of the parts I certainly didn't

544
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:10,779
watch a minor so they were reps with

545
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:23,650
scientific articles some mathematic

546
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:34,690
calculations some clients were getting

547
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:38,550
access to those ropes scale shortened

548
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:43,390
says it was around fifty thousand I

549
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:52,470
calculated some 1.5 k for clusters not

550
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:56,020
pastors but hosts taking those filters

551
00:38:52,470 --> 00:39:02,250
country regions whatever filter and look

552
00:38:56,020 --> 00:39:02,250
for your company or any company you know

553
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:12,580
this cluster when you try can be an open

554
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:14,970
door into your infrastructure how do we

555
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,970
protect

556
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,220
there are a number of guides and

557
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:24,000
trainings and I cannot tell you

558
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:29,370
everything so what so what is the main

559
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:31,440
of a skin in the images of skin check

560
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:38,310
the packages for vulnerabilities don't

561
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:41,880
let search images more even if you have

562
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:46,410
have more than one customers if you have

563
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:48,690
a large organization and you deploy 104

564
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:51,509
is a day and you have totally a thousand

565
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:58,950
I really know companies with that one

566
00:39:51,510 --> 00:40:00,990
thousand two thousand clusters there is

567
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:06,180
an internal attacker why don't shoot

568
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:12,359
your side images because you reduce the

569
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:18,390
risk of insider a minor or evershell a

570
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:20,580
backdoor where the number of people who

571
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:28,379
have they seek the right to science you

572
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:32,069
mitigate that risk images and image

573
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:34,680
possible to avoid situations of

574
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:37,380
deployment of all packages because that

575
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:43,410
thing will ask you for a new one and the

576
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:45,360
second one will respond to similar

577
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:48,980
situations

578
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:52,390
throw out docker hub if you use it don't

579
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:55,310
you better have

580
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:58,450
registry and keep all the images and

581
00:40:55,310 --> 00:41:01,549
scan them and sign and be happy

582
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:06,230
utilities that can be of use the first

583
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:08,870
three allowed you to scan the packages

584
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:14,630
for known vulnerabilities and the floors

585
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:20,540
allows you to size so minimum privileges

586
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:33,140
use SPS cruelty in names face is a good

587
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:35,840
thing we landed mean from development I

588
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:38,029
don't know your structure if you know

589
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:42,410
that you have a big application from a

590
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:44,480
small service just as we provide the

591
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:46,730
minimum quarters it would not save you

592
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:50,750
and at least you know when a minor

593
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:52,580
launchers there and start just picking

594
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:56,120
your resources at least you will see

595
00:41:52,580 --> 00:42:01,069
their bug is not easy you need to study

596
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:03,080
it's not simple are bad is worth

597
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:08,210
studying when you have it look at this

598
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:11,000
utility I guess made by one of the main

599
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:16,580
contributors good thing

600
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:19,430
try pond security policy avoid

601
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:22,580
privileged containers in the second demo

602
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:25,879
it works because they launched of

603
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:30,200
privileged containers was permitted use

604
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:34,870
see comp of honor and see Linux the

605
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:34,870
launch under different users as the most

606
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:43,670
system if if you can avoid writing

607
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:46,480
something there don't try it for

608
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:46,480
security policy

609
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:52,630
we'll be there to assist the works

610
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:59,259
approximate relaxing previous utility

611
00:42:52,630 --> 00:43:02,470
and you feed them your configured more

612
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:05,440
or less reasonable policies than the

613
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:12,819
network perimeter issues restrict

614
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:17,260
restrict but policies IP addresses use

615
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:24,520
well we use tags whatever policies can

616
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:26,440
work with them ingress control with web

617
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:28,660
application firewalls remember the

618
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:31,420
injection format it's all the silver

619
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:35,410
over the vasila a simple one will

620
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:37,750
protect you from summer cats restrict is

621
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:40,569
an incoming traffic elements for bits

622
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:43,510
and system related data if you use well

623
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:47,860
providers is not easy because you needed

624
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:51,340
it but then if you restrict you will be

625
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:54,610
safer than air but we use a mission

626
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:59,650
controller in charge of security they

627
00:43:54,610 --> 00:44:03,460
have over twenty but still privileges do

628
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:07,330
not launch they activate container known

629
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:09,960
routes and dinners rotate certificates

630
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:13,660
is a nice keys that can save you or

631
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:16,300
mitigate the risk even they give the

632
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:22,299
attacker five certificates and keys this

633
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:27,460
key restricts a time it will just reduce

634
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:32,380
the time available for the attacker else

635
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:35,650
will help you you heard about my

636
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:40,820
security ah yes patriarchy is a major

637
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:46,370
market for applied and cue bench

638
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:57,800
launched on the almost on the masternode

639
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:59,509
and you can get much information they

640
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:04,090
will tell you how to do it's convenient

641
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:14,960
and automates very well what else I like

642
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:20,420
CSD IDs so you will have a panel with a

643
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:23,480
chart when you see that someone sends

644
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:26,270
exacto pod and you will be able to

645
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:28,280
respond adequately but it does not have

646
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:31,120
preventive measures so it will not save

647
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:35,780
you at least you will know about it

648
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:39,980
and a cool if you like check quick so

649
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:44,870
this is from the report about ways to

650
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:54,320
hack you or not to hack here so

651
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:56,660
pipelines you check the emergency your

652
00:45:54,320 --> 00:46:01,850
sign if you can sign it with

653
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:04,879
functionality restrict library's traffic

654
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:07,029
dependences and monitor suppose there

655
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:10,640
are villages and find known

656
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:15,240
vulnerabilities and it will help you in

657
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:17,190
case of emergency so when you

658
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:19,979
to debrief and understand how an

659
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:30,540
incident handler when you need to do the

660
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:38,010
forensic into the runtime to check you

661
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:41,759
bench the same money aqua security the

662
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:46,020
does pin tests it's interesting it works

663
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:49,380
fast and allows you to understand which

664
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:53,009
ports are open which as a vulnerability

665
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:57,119
and just like people try to perform the

666
00:46:53,010 --> 00:47:16,170
command inside the an arbitrary and we

667
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:21,240
use so I was shocked but in fact when in

668
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:23,550
December 2018 we found a logical mistake

669
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:27,839
illogical error we went to the cloud

670
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:30,869
good and it's it's easy or they have

671
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:34,020
already upgraded that a new release but

672
00:47:30,869 --> 00:47:36,300
think about they upgrade

673
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:39,480
what do we need to remember when you

674
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:43,140
work with metadata consuming is a

675
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:46,470
promise to remove it but still you can

676
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:53,160
provide your metadata one way you need

677
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:55,109
to recreate the cluster people in your

678
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:58,609
resources launching your cluster with

679
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:58,610
this takunda

680
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:15,420
users is their own directories and cue

681
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:18,919
bench and cube hunter work intends to

682
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:24,470
make an encrypted filesystem for their

683
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:28,020
secrets should be good but we shall see

684
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:30,419
I have more useful utilities for you

685
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:33,630
these are the more or less attacking

686
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:37,560
utilities except for the last one with

687
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:40,170
the audit try there are so many and you

688
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:44,369
have different infrastructures and goals

689
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:49,310
and businesses some of them will fit and

690
00:48:44,369 --> 00:48:49,310
the instruction to the captain upgrade

691
00:48:52,609 --> 00:48:59,690
if you Burnett is develop said I would I

692
00:48:56,510 --> 00:49:03,119
would take as a main version and then

693
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:06,570
upgrade there permanently try to catch

694
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:10,080
up with Google and think about security

695
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:15,309
at all stages from idea to deploy

696
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:17,799
deploying and automate cheers and

697
00:49:15,309 --> 00:49:21,719
if you have many things many clusters

698
00:49:17,799 --> 00:49:25,059
it's unreal two handles and me do it so

699
00:49:21,719 --> 00:49:30,279
add a couple of lines in to safe

700
00:49:25,059 --> 00:49:33,009
security pipelines starting remember

701
00:49:30,279 --> 00:49:36,009
that your resources and the keys and

702
00:49:33,009 --> 00:49:39,189
certificates cost money every mining

703
00:49:36,009 --> 00:49:42,669
story hits your resources they cost

704
00:49:39,189 --> 00:49:48,029
money and sometimes it may very strongly

705
00:49:42,669 --> 00:49:51,609
impact your infrastructure and our team

706
00:49:48,029 --> 00:49:55,779
was laughing when we was getting ready

707
00:49:51,609 --> 00:49:58,299
for the presentations we went to the

708
00:49:55,779 --> 00:50:02,829
places where miners are already present

709
00:49:58,299 --> 00:50:05,499
so we found those ID kilometers of idea

710
00:50:02,829 --> 00:50:08,799
when you go to Manila and insert and see

711
00:50:05,499 --> 00:50:11,919
how much they have mined and we saw that

712
00:50:08,799 --> 00:50:16,089
the two small clusters are mined some

713
00:50:11,919 --> 00:50:18,339
some $600 if you multiply by a thousand

714
00:50:16,089 --> 00:50:21,308
three you know they did it that's quite

715
00:50:18,339 --> 00:50:23,078
lucrative this is a wonderful slide

716
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:25,749
where you see nothing that's the way it

717
00:50:23,079 --> 00:50:27,609
should be there is an organization that

718
00:50:25,749 --> 00:50:36,218
called called native computing

719
00:50:27,609 --> 00:50:39,880
foundation that takes top utilities and

720
00:50:36,219 --> 00:50:42,339
the announcers and distributes and they

721
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:45,029
broke down into categories there is a

722
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:45,029
link for you

723
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:51,480
it's an interactive map where you can

724
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:53,550
select I'm a developer I want this

725
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:59,340
utilities I'm a security guy I want

726
00:50:53,550 --> 00:51:06,900
those utilities and you can go to the

727
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:09,590
public clusters utility and I'm done I

728
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,590
thank you

729
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:13,010
[Music]

730
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:19,280
unfortunately there is no time for

731
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:24,850
questions and after the presentation you

732
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:24,850
can approach the speaker personally
