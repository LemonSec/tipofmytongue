on post a psychologist applications

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:11,610
Department of the bay my colleagues who

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:13,469
are specialists in different security

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,198
will tell you about the problems in the

5
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:19,140
world that we are living at what

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:24,750
difficulties we see as experts and what

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:27,599
could be the solutions and a future just

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,670
wants to do which I to start calling

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,120
watching these pictures and they will

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:37,489
start telling you couple of sports in

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,489
which they are experts thank you

12
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:48,770
present Otsu can you turn on the

13
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:53,570
presentation please so the first person

14
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:56,309
and marble have specialists in incident

15
00:00:53,570 --> 00:01:00,260
investigations in positive technologists

16
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:06,750
welcome thank you

17
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:08,670
dima colleagues hello good morning a lot

18
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,420
to talk about targeted attacks and the

19
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,950
trends of recent years and do we really

20
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:18,439
have any innovations in targeted attacks

21
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:21,680
at a super difficult or complex not be

22
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:25,830
detected or we have some depredation and

23
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:29,450
we can talk about the misunderstanding

24
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,450
of organizations about double attacks

25
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:37,290
the first misconception is telling

26
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,939
people say it's super difficult

27
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:46,979
something extremely difficult yes can be

28
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:49,250
found but there's very few of them much

29
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:51,689
more attacks are just much personal

30
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,700
immediately no more attacks use

31
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:58,258
privilege less it's like it's not that

32
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:02,280
young yes yeah because it's logic decent

33
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:05,250
security with white targeted groups

34
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,950
disease myasthenia butter much in zero

35
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:11,210
day if they can use simple methods often

36
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:14,550
used wrong abilities if you patch your

37
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:18,000
vulnerabilities in time it helps a lot

38
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:24,240
so what nutritional started because zero

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,910
is expensive toy few of them that's why

40
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,520
it's a small chance that they would

41
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:32,190
decide to use against you some zero

42
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:36,180
thing which also they use very primitive

43
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:39,150
methods well known that you the

44
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:43,520
following stage this year in additional

45
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,520
significant network through the mimikar

46
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:59,220
just easy recipe basically I disagree

47
00:02:52,440 --> 00:03:03,120
that targeted attacks are very hard as

48
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:06,450
you will cope against most of them are

49
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,220
not so complex if you want to live

50
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:12,030
examples you know agent you know it's

51
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:15,540
coming to report as my colleague Dennis

52
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:18,140
Kushina see the way I like me to my

53
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:22,170
tactic you move and kill show examples

54
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:26,130
this is a very submerged how this group

55
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:28,530
of attackers was found second miss

56
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:32,100
concept that the these attacks could not

57
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:37,220
be protected against again the main

58
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:42,570
problem that we see is no basic hygiene

59
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:46,380
IT security and if you do it actually

60
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:51,530
complicates I bet the job all these fun

61
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:54,810
to do too much which lets enough

62
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:56,760
attention is a possibility security as

63
00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:00,480
such it don't have resources they don't

64
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:03,000
serve people and one important problem

65
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,269
is people don't know their own mental

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,990
structure

67
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:12,330
so defenders have a great advantage show

68
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:15,070
attackers that they play on the field

69
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:18,340
you know their infrastructure you should

70
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:23,140
know better than others in which and

71
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:25,630
it's great shaking nose with your

72
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:27,310
processor if you wish you when you

73
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:30,130
receive that derivative up is the cheat

74
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:32,740
wash a first stage thing you need to

75
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:35,700
know is to learn your network as much it

76
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:38,340
is that solutions I'm helping is outside

77
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:41,409
which finished University

78
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:45,369
you should not posting just we're done

79
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:47,740
we need zest nail salon Groupon third

80
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:50,380
miss concept they'll say we are not

81
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,600
interested to it for target groups were

82
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:55,900
not do anything well this could be

83
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:59,050
effect you might have a small company so

84
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:09,130
why bother attacking here but the

85
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:12,520
reality is use your sources your that we

86
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:15,159
see the small organization is hack which

87
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:20,130
has a client access to a larger

88
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:22,650
organization and this is interesting to

89
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:26,110
penetrate through the small ones

90
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:29,530
personas partner VPN access isn't

91
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:35,110
limited but if the organization is well

92
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:35,770
protected it's quite hard to attack you

93
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,770
directly

94
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:42,909
any company has a lot of subcontractors

95
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:47,169
small companies and they cannot use so

96
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:52,690
much attention the other case we've been

97
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:56,020
observing using your sources the

98
00:05:52,690 --> 00:06:01,510
passages your servers is chose to be

99
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:07,770
used as control ones it's also could

100
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:09,599
bring unpleasant things it could be

101
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:15,270
Melbourne

102
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:17,399
let us do member servers you can get

103
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:20,520
troubles with more enforcement they can

104
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:22,229
withdraw some of your equipment because

105
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:26,818
through your service another

106
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:29,639
organization or network was attacked so

107
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:32,550
you cannot be protected but you cannot

108
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:34,889
save your name start interested for

109
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:37,889
targeted groups because they have

110
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:40,770
nothing to take another things they

111
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:43,139
claim Oh we protected we invest billions

112
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:44,669
of dollars to security and we have the

113
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:46,709
best experts we're the best

114
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:51,628
but there is no hundred percent

115
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:56,069
protection many questions to efficiency

116
00:06:51,629 --> 00:07:02,369
of IT security are claiming about 5%

117
00:06:56,069 --> 00:07:04,919
protection you must be sure about if you

118
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:07,709
have regular penetration tests you

119
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:11,128
validate what you have built your setup

120
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:13,019
old processes and some shirts from a

121
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:14,909
billet you can say that your best

122
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:17,909
potential but of course never give you

123
00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:21,240
the best guarantee and if you've

124
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:22,889
protected once if you're sure as you

125
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,059
have an interesting organization you're

126
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:29,129
always targeted in any case having

127
00:07:26,059 --> 00:07:32,579
rejected one attack there's no guarantee

128
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:34,909
that you can defend again other attack

129
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:39,240
in the future it goes in the Narrows

130
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:43,979
amount of time so say that you can be

131
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:46,860
protected 10% is not a miss concept it

132
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:50,899
can prepare to targeted attacks and you

133
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:54,180
can having obtained information using

134
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:58,139
knowledge ins about coming attacks or

135
00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:03,119
about methods has group that groups use

136
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:05,309
or information about the groups which

137
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:08,189
are pressing and important for your

138
00:08:05,309 --> 00:08:12,149
region and industry it can be prepared

139
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:14,219
more effectively more effectively

140
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:21,520
understands your bottlenecks and you can

141
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:24,810
do proactive not to wait until your

142
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,789
the defense will detect something but

143
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:33,370
try to go ahead and if you know that you

144
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:37,169
a target for the groups it's interesting

145
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:39,669
to find such activity in your network

146
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:41,049
because there's no house and protections

147
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:45,360
cannot be sure that your protection

148
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:48,880
measures are going to detect everything

149
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,810
experience shows that need in difficult

150
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,360
cases

151
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:56,109
nothing will be detected and of course

152
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:58,360
expertise is required the organization

153
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:01,750
you need to grow such expertise if you

154
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:05,020
know that you have such targeted groups

155
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:08,260
enables people to resources to find

156
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:10,000
things right and I'm now thinking I'm

157
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:15,670
ready to answer questions if you have

158
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:20,399
them let's say a question from this

159
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:20,399
audience you want to ask something

160
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:34,469
really understood for the past half year

161
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:38,349
I already knew everything that goes away

162
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:40,930
from spearfishing mystical domains

163
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:43,690
without any thoughts we desire to send

164
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:48,829
millions of emails and get zero zero one

165
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:50,459
percent feedback or using a worm like

166
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:54,270
[Music]

167
00:09:50,459 --> 00:10:01,750
what a cry level which caused everything

168
00:09:54,270 --> 00:10:05,500
you can ape attacks people use zero one

169
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:10,270
percent of brain to customise malware

170
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:16,209
and emails for the target and purpose of

171
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:18,160
attacks not start mining groups and

172
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:20,680
doing some stupid things but instead

173
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:26,290
understand the system like in written

174
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:29,040
tests understand where we want to go and

175
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,040
do pivoting

176
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:37,990
is going to be considered targeted

177
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:41,180
attacks in general yes my disagreeing

178
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:50,000
that you gave example as massive attacks

179
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:54,229
and at this apt apt their massive

180
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,709
attacks but banks trillions it's very

181
00:10:54,230 --> 00:11:06,050
hard play hard it's very difficult organ

182
00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:09,109
grab cryptids mass distribution but

183
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:11,899
technically it's made very very good

184
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:13,820
quality again there's been a reporter

185
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:17,149
flying Polly can get the person but

186
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:20,990
thanks trying RT it those developed very

187
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:25,459
good quality it's very complex by the

188
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:27,769
setup but very widely spread idea the

189
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:28,279
more victims better it's about something

190
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:31,220
else

191
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:36,260
what you said guys could me initially

192
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:40,060
spend some time to develop very common

193
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:43,459
blacks utility not into lines but

194
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:46,160
afterwards they can go into the wild and

195
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:50,810
don't touch it it works by itself that's

196
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:55,910
why it's complex Heather should organize

197
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:58,640
itself and no need for manual control

198
00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:04,839
and that's a difference between targeted

199
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:09,350
attacks that and these spearfishing and

200
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:11,570
works general yes I can add that in

201
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:15,410
targeted attacks normally you need to

202
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:20,959
have involved ins of operator you see in

203
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:23,029
cases management movement inside indeed

204
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,310
there's an operator sitting and gives

205
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:27,019
commands searching for data makes

206
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:30,290
mistakes and commands we have

207
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:33,380
interesting examples when people see in

208
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:35,779
the windows console and type commands

209
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:38,540
somewhere miss types trying to do

210
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:40,189
something nice main difference because

211
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:43,959
indeed massage master

212
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:46,910
tax their targeting to turn automatic

213
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:49,119
tools that work without a traitor are

214
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:51,350
traitors in some exceptional cases can

215
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,870
connect it and do something interactive

216
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:58,699
but mainly should they have a specific

217
00:12:53,870 --> 00:13:00,319
task to encrypt machine steal data sent

218
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:03,800
to control server and then they

219
00:13:00,319 --> 00:13:06,319
processes very targeted attacks is not

220
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,449
like that they are actually moving

221
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:11,029
inside the network they have a specific

222
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:13,969
task to collect some data they are

223
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:16,610
sitting and interactively searching

224
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:19,810
where these data are either sitting for

225
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:23,680
a long time like in case of the recent

226
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:26,359
witness might find the group taskmasters

227
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:30,109
means at least during the organisation

228
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:32,240
they've been sitting for eight years you

229
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:35,600
can see that they've been there for a

230
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:39,350
long time and eventually connected

231
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:43,790
getting your data they had it constant

232
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:50,750
access he'll answer the question are

233
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:53,269
there any questions give it up to the

234
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:57,319
speaker once again and thank you very

235
00:13:53,269 --> 00:14:01,009
much election right to state was even

236
00:13:57,319 --> 00:14:08,469
Azzaro is specialized in security of

237
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:08,470
industrial systems hi everybody

238
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:23,600
I see oh my god so probably great light

239
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:28,339
installation which meant it for a long

240
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:31,040
time if I have a lack of sleep I'm sorry

241
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:34,220
I have a speech but I don't remember it

242
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:39,760
well I rather read it but I can answer

243
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:39,760
questions to Pintrest said that I do

244
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:45,979
dust for security and positive

245
00:14:42,590 --> 00:15:03,320
technologist my presentation was called

246
00:14:45,980 --> 00:15:07,730
what was the belief in process control

247
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:09,950
system it was supposed to be in the

248
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:16,610
middle but these things were supposed to

249
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:20,030
be around it but anyway let's start from

250
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:23,570
the tired Bruce Snyder has been

251
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:29,329
repeating this thing that security

252
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:36,080
through obscurity is bad well the whole

253
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:41,150
system in the middle have a magical

254
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:45,470
plant as people's herb which cures the

255
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:52,040
wounds and then the floor builds word

256
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:57,880
belief it has a right to leave but it

257
00:15:52,040 --> 00:16:04,430
doesn't help against attacks and then

258
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:07,910
attempts to separate Network to separate

259
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:13,099
the network from the process control

260
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:16,069
systems let me start from the end until

261
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:19,680
we forgot what I said before network

262
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:24,069
could be separated everybody says

263
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:26,469
very strange conflicts when you say you

264
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:32,469
have a network yes but it's separated

265
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:36,459
from everything well if you just ask

266
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:40,050
people who work there your date from

267
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:46,089
network goes up yes telemetrics goes up

268
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:49,870
we have cuts how much output was from

269
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:51,990
the shop where it goes to the server's

270
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:54,790
corporate network and public network

271
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:56,170
what is there we have email internet and

272
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:59,469
stuff Oh

273
00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:03,250
the network is stopped this is a thing

274
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:06,309
if it goes back and forth and as our pin

275
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:08,260
testers prove during every pin tests you

276
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:13,899
can reach there either data are

277
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:16,949
transferred top down you can get there

278
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:20,880
for us it's a fact but for some people

279
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:20,880
people still don't believe in dinosaurs

280
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:24,160
[Music]

281
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:31,600
so the set of cryptography proves to the

282
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:35,260
rest of the world if you wrote the

283
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:39,668
protocol or a code but you never told

284
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:44,340
anyone how it works you're safe nobody

285
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:44,340
knows where are the deficiencies

286
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:51,970
colleagues from the reverse engineering

287
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:56,590
department always show this principle

288
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:59,409
that you can download in current the act

289
00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:06,209
programs of best versions somebody is

290
00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:06,210
doing that I think this is wrong

291
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:27,630
they certainly also and the specific

292
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:27,629
features of the automated control system

293
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:36,490
the efficiency is the same as with rib

294
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:45,100
grass it is fading quickly it is

295
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:47,860
seasonal but is cheap so the next one

296
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:51,969
next let's go from constructive

297
00:18:47,860 --> 00:19:13,840
criticism to fruitful attempts what to

298
00:18:51,970 --> 00:19:19,410
do we need to understand what are the

299
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:19,409
ports which are used you share open

300
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:40,540
don't know what is what they have for

301
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:42,520
example we had a situation with 80

302
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:45,850
people during pin tests but this is a

303
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:51,160
life here these are the typical things

304
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:55,020
and but industrial protocols nobody

305
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:58,030
knows how they work what they do that

306
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:59,889
you can do that if you choose new

307
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:03,610
solution or if you have an opportunity

308
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:07,150
you can simply change the soft parts or

309
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:11,500
hardware you don't use something open

310
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:14,710
and then on the standards hardware can

311
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,500
help you and standard protection can

312
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:19,830
help you too

313
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:23,100
so this is the difficult thing to

314
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:25,379
understand the unknown industrial

315
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:29,639
protocol or obscure industrial protocol

316
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:32,360
but you can solve it you can outsource

317
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,530
us we've been doing this for a long time

318
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,240
successfully with of our colleagues

319
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:38,910
clients are happy

320
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:44,850
yes it's long it's expensive it's hard

321
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:47,190
but result is worth it after that we

322
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:53,790
ended our projects in our pros can't do

323
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:55,470
that that's ok thank you if you have

324
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:58,590
questions please ask now

325
00:20:55,470 --> 00:21:00,690
later on I'll run away from here to our

326
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:08,970
installation because our people are

327
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:10,770
there everything is always yes the

328
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:12,930
installation with trains and windmills

329
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,290
whatever yes there always people there

330
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:20,220
Oh

331
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:23,070
our colleague was just questioned what

332
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:31,220
with mobile operators in the collect

333
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:31,220
industrial IOT I think is it the same

334
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:38,430
industrial IOT automated control system

335
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:42,270
no I think it's not the same your

336
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:46,770
different things actually I'm not

337
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:57,300
dipping this this industrial IOT it's

338
00:21:46,770 --> 00:22:01,379
like mobile Android a question to you

339
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:05,790
about the difference and the hardware

340
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:07,650
part you're more focused on that yes if

341
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:09,550
none of the questions thanks you all for

342
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:11,570
your attention

343
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:14,370
[Applause]

344
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:16,320
Thank You Vladimir and now all doctor

345
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:21,899
give a floor to the mythical bottom

346
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:23,030
hotel is about the 5g security 5g

347
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:27,090
network security

348
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:30,990
my name is Dima Corbett of

349
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:34,259
my slide you can pay attention that to

350
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:40,940
my slides are different styles two

351
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:44,610
reasons I will target in five G and I

352
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:48,330
used another templates let's talk about

353
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:49,979
what is Phi of G we have a security come

354
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:52,830
for a second well understand that you

355
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,350
are aware what is vulnerability and

356
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:58,139
threats but what is five G who needs

357
00:22:55,350 --> 00:23:01,230
that I wanted to talk through it it's

358
00:22:58,139 --> 00:23:04,168
too obvious if they'll take some short

359
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:05,970
time if not obvious things would be a

360
00:23:04,169 --> 00:23:08,549
right foundation for the further

361
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:12,240
discussions about what a security in the

362
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:20,009
era of new generations of communication

363
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:23,549
networks also knew about VAR g obvious

364
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:24,509
things networks will become the FASTA LT

365
00:23:23,549 --> 00:23:29,158
is enough now

366
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:32,519
but with 5g speed would increase is the

367
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:35,460
k10 times but it will increase for the

368
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:37,190
subscribers who need that who don't use

369
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:41,190
this for passing capacity

370
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:54,049
second major comment and specifics and

371
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:56,820
5g latency will go down those who don't

372
00:23:54,049 --> 00:24:03,168
bother about latency the service will

373
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:07,559
not be provided to search feature 5g

374
00:24:03,169 --> 00:24:09,649
will become more flexible before the

375
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:12,240
network was giving you the services was

376
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:15,689
expected for now there's a great

377
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:18,210
precedent and I'm beginning of 2019

378
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:20,820
American company arising had a proposal

379
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:22,970
and said million dollars to those who

380
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:25,799
offer new business case which we can

381
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:27,860
realize through five gene so the range

382
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:30,960
of opportunities with digital services

383
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:33,090
which the service will allow to provide

384
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,919
to consumers doesn't matter individuals

385
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:39,730
or companies is so broad that now people

386
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:43,539
mobile operators and vendors are

387
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:45,490
build and develop this networks into the

388
00:24:43,539 --> 00:24:47,679
target they don't finally understand I

389
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:49,590
was going to be utilized only basic

390
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:54,340
business case I worked out that you know

391
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:57,340
bull transit Aviva we are you have no

392
00:24:54,340 --> 00:25:00,779
connected car whatever major stuff

393
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:04,019
breasts are to be invented and the force

394
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:07,690
specifics and featured 5g network can

395
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:11,620
cover not just different networks not

396
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:14,230
just billions but tens hundreds of

397
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:17,500
billions of devices do not so many

398
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:20,289
people but would be so many connected

399
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:25,539
device and 5g is expecting the worlds of

400
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:28,450
connected devices this IOT Internet of

401
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:29,889
Things so in fact for the past twenty

402
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:38,470
years for many of us mobile network

403
00:25:29,889 --> 00:25:40,178
started from not many of us were started

404
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:43,240
using and they started to use the first

405
00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:45,250
one in 1995 twenty years passed since

406
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:48,190
then we constantly enhanced the

407
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:50,549
requirements to the network you want

408
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:54,789
internet way faster terrace with japan

409
00:25:50,549 --> 00:26:01,389
be better coverage the quality of polls

410
00:25:54,789 --> 00:26:04,840
better etc and this is good i said

411
00:26:01,389 --> 00:26:09,820
before what we have now like LTE LC plus

412
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:11,740
plus most of people more than enough to

413
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:14,769
make sure that the core is your voice is

414
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:17,230
great speed of uploading is great you

415
00:26:14,769 --> 00:26:24,730
don't have a problem watching YouTube

416
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:26,649
and but very soon in our life is going

417
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:29,409
to be a lot of connected devices which

418
00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:33,789
would solve a lot of business related

419
00:26:29,409 --> 00:26:36,159
tasks like microscopic components of I

420
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:40,389
would see that you don't even think

421
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:43,940
about starting from heat consumption

422
00:26:40,389 --> 00:26:46,649
meters in his house

423
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:50,940
to take and flip it over interphase the

424
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:52,919
idea is that all potentially connected

425
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:57,570
devices could use fire chief for their

426
00:26:52,919 --> 00:27:02,659
needs the principle 5g is a killer for

427
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:04,678
all the connection is with 5g will go up

428
00:27:02,659 --> 00:27:08,630
potentially in the future we won't have

429
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:11,190
Wi-Fi Bluetooth and the networks like

430
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:14,159
Sapporo one which are common in Europe

431
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:17,909
achieve those not veneer because of

432
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:23,130
these needs will be covered by 5g and as

433
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:25,080
you understand we are at the age of 50

434
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:28,169
notation of this technology but within

435
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:30,809
10 years we won't be able to imagine our

436
00:27:28,169 --> 00:27:32,190
life without it so the question is if

437
00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:34,710
you get used to these technologies what

438
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:37,860
happens if they work bad if somebody

439
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:40,140
tries to hack them and how can we live

440
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:45,120
without them if they won't work as

441
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:51,950
wanted as designed right let's jump away

442
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:54,959
into the threats of modern generations

443
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:59,309
of communication technologies I said

444
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:01,380
what they are today 2g 3G 4G big time

445
00:27:59,309 --> 00:28:02,450
every one of us as a subscriber is

446
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:07,080
vulnerable

447
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:12,390
not so many information to be needed but

448
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:14,490
you by hackers to make an attack hacker

449
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:17,130
needs your phone number and having this

450
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:21,000
information he can anywhere in the

451
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:23,700
planet can trace your location catch SMS

452
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:31,590
listen to telephone call you've seen

453
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:32,220
presidents when people trace data you

454
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:35,370
intercept

455
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:38,820
data stop between my phone and base

456
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:41,418
stations but deceiving the network which

457
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:44,220
allows it to route out the traffic

458
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:49,470
different way

459
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:51,390
so they hacker forces me to attack

460
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:55,460
through DNS servers but these

461
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:58,050
vulnerabilities exploitation of the

462
00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:00,660
blacks in architecture if you can

463
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:04,680
intercept voice SMS data you can easily

464
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:10,590
get access to starting from email social

465
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:14,010
media electronic governance sites and

466
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:16,860
switch off the network let you throw you

467
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:18,990
out from the coverage zone these are

468
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:21,120
still serious vulnerabilities they are

469
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:24,650
confirmed that it happened in the world

470
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:30,179
before the first president was in 2016

471
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:37,170
when you wanna see what date is it

472
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:40,440
maybe it's 2017 when in Germany they

473
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:45,360
stole money from a liable banks and the

474
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:47,820
line Bank was protected but attackers

475
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:50,760
used the vulnerability of two German

476
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:52,669
authorities mobile networks intercepted

477
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:55,620
SMS with the verification codes

478
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:58,080
implemented and they completed financial

479
00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:02,729
transaction not the president was in

480
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:07,980
2017 with Norwegian operated Telenor in

481
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:18,450
the network as it received some legal

482
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:20,790
traffic people rose down during 25 hours

483
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:23,760
and millions of subscribers had big

484
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:26,250
problems with communication millions

485
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,520
subscribers for Norway like 10%

486
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:33,150
population or something I don't know

487
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:35,810
we're serious president and then it's

488
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,810
very important

489
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:43,330
we talked about vulnerability of mobile

490
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:56,950
network it affects a lot of areas that

491
00:30:43,330 --> 00:31:01,000
you don't think about so can the

492
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:02,440
attacker or intruders still money from

493
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,960
my EU wallet

494
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:07,480
yes made a video video when we first

495
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:14,950
compromised Gmail get access to the Box

496
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:19,120
inbox and then upon base require or

497
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:21,160
requests password restorations link will

498
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,919
go to Gmail box and at the end you can

499
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:29,860
access to open base transferred the

500
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:31,980
money is a script as it is a crypt the

501
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:35,699
money's gone forever

502
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:38,440
and there's the nuance I spoke about

503
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:45,100
vulnerabilities which were pressing and

504
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:48,280
are for the networks up to LT 5g is just

505
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:51,939
implemented in the first iteration would

506
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:53,320
go for 3 years it's 5g non-central

507
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:57,180
Arvind operators one stolen base

508
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:59,590
stations two antennas the core the base

509
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:02,830
network law remains same which was

510
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:05,379
servicing the means of fealty and then

511
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:08,710
this network she has a problem I think

512
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:14,410
that this back compatibility because the

513
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:21,100
generations communications are put on

514
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:24,010
top of one another so this much current

515
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:29,070
is produced with 5g in perspective of

516
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:33,129
three five years what are these problems

517
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:35,950
rejection and servicing according to our

518
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:39,100
information and it's confirmed by

519
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:40,900
colleagues abroad by mobile operators

520
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:45,610
which monitoring Network can analyze

521
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:49,170
them today 100% of LTE networks are

522
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:51,990
vulnerable to attacks like cancer

523
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:54,480
stopped in servicing oh it looks like

524
00:32:51,990 --> 00:33:04,470
all networks connected through roaming

525
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:11,400
channels channels include er give a

526
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:28,620
command about any these guys left your

527
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:37,850
zone left into vacation so depressing

528
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:37,850
for LC networks and failure in service

529
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:47,640
they have traffic in the network default

530
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:51,440
tries to get registered in the network

531
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:58,430
if it's in the alarm pressure gauge

532
00:33:51,440 --> 00:34:02,700
meter gauge or boiler meter average time

533
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:04,680
when connected device gets disconnected

534
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:07,260
is three three and a half hours which is

535
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:09,960
long if you take a look at the picture

536
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:12,210
normally the regular paradigm of IT

537
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,240
security which is important

538
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:17,399
confidentiality integrity and

539
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:20,239
accessibility for IOT goes upside down

540
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:21,569
because then the most important thing is

541
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:25,020
accessibility

542
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:28,830
there's no connect now I would see it's

543
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:30,259
useless this is piece of metal it's

544
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:33,179
important thing for them is

545
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:35,669
accessibility integrity and

546
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:40,590
confidentiality lasts and accessibility

547
00:34:35,668 --> 00:34:42,690
is under threats and then what my

548
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:47,550
colleagues mentioned before Bruce

549
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:50,639
Schneier security versus obscurity often

550
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:56,070
security was achieved as it was very

551
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:59,460
high entry barrier were unclear

552
00:34:56,070 --> 00:35:00,090
technologists most specifications etc

553
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:04,560
until it

554
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:08,310
world as a good new decatur of how it

555
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:10,529
was working before 2g networks it was

556
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:15,270
hard to break when they started like ten

557
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:19,370
years ago because nobody taught us was

558
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:19,370
little information about it but now

559
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:29,670
telecom goes forth towards IT

560
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:32,669
technologists because they became better

561
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:35,330
and vital and in 5g specifications which

562
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:38,070
have been confirmed and standardized

563
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:41,580
we'll step away from telecom specific

564
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:44,160
protocols strongly adapt IT protocols

565
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:47,250
and we'll use them for the integrity of

566
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:50,279
network for everything changed and miss

567
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:52,980
that potentially to try to exploit some

568
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:55,170
basic vulnerabilities would be as such

569
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:58,110
as break a perimeter of any IT

570
00:35:55,170 --> 00:36:02,790
infrastructure I'm not saying it'll work

571
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:06,360
hundred percent but one can trying you

572
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:14,790
to understand the fanciest word as then

573
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:20,570
and nfe it's so based on OpenStack

574
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:24,000
whatever you can meet 19 any admins can

575
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:27,630
read familiar words and would be able to

576
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:31,100
configure it the pin tester may not they

577
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:34,710
can't understand the context he is in

578
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:37,259
will nourish can exploit get into the

579
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:43,590
system and hell knows how successful he

580
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:46,710
will be their second finding it would be

581
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:50,430
as easy to break 5g as any ecosystem of

582
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:54,900
a regular IT company it's not a percent

583
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:58,740
so one can try a colleague of mine had a

584
00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:00,360
job that security 5g is like teenage sex

585
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:04,109
everybody is talking about it but nobody

586
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:08,579
tried saying have a percent with 5g

587
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:11,679
security need to look at the specific

588
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:14,400
systems how they function and only

589
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:17,459
identify them and talk about risks and

590
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:23,920
vulnerability of this particular Network

591
00:37:17,459 --> 00:37:28,149
last part about the world of our t5g of

592
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:31,499
course is built-in for the connected

593
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:34,959
devices we understand if at a certain

594
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:38,140
time most of subscribers who do not

595
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:40,390
people but devices it's very important

596
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:43,209
organically these devices operate how

597
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:47,170
protected or not protected they are and

598
00:37:43,209 --> 00:37:49,569
the experience show not for me to

599
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:53,199
explain to you we all know that Security

600
00:37:49,569 --> 00:37:55,029
Authority is suffering because the

601
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:58,109
element base is assembled from

602
00:37:55,029 --> 00:38:01,769
everything software open-source

603
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:07,420
Ollivander society tried to shorten up

604
00:38:01,769 --> 00:38:10,269
time to go to market until the product

605
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:13,329
is rolled out in this product cycle

606
00:38:10,269 --> 00:38:16,839
there is no much time for security and

607
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:18,939
think that it is protected the logic and

608
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:20,499
objectively business is not needed we

609
00:38:18,939 --> 00:38:24,249
haven't seen much problems with

610
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:26,499
diabilities but the problems we saw were

611
00:38:24,249 --> 00:38:29,229
serious like crystals with mirrors and

612
00:38:26,499 --> 00:38:32,019
my colleagues like of cigarette reviews

613
00:38:29,229 --> 00:38:35,769
people who is last year made protection

614
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:38,979
analysis of one popular devices like

615
00:38:35,769 --> 00:38:42,660
Wi-Fi routers it has so many

616
00:38:38,979 --> 00:38:47,019
vulnerabilities that help to compromise

617
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:51,308
the device go into botnet develop attack

618
00:38:47,019 --> 00:38:54,640
to the house network but yet user

619
00:38:51,309 --> 00:38:57,969
devices but not component is easy as an

620
00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:00,009
interest we continue to observe how

621
00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:03,599
these devices live and how many of them

622
00:39:00,009 --> 00:39:08,410
are internet vendors are aware produced

623
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:09,849
pages but who produces patches through

624
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:12,640
kettles

625
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:15,369
you know many operators in the world

626
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:18,308
operate these devices here they sell

627
00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:20,410
them in the selling my 9.0 cents minimal

628
00:39:18,309 --> 00:39:23,739
you know that's why after vendor

629
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:26,339
produced fetches and abated even the

630
00:39:23,739 --> 00:39:29,890
vendors plant continues producing

631
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:31,089
devices with old versions because it was

632
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:33,999
a rollout

633
00:39:31,089 --> 00:39:41,680
there's no time to update the production

634
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:43,660
process 150,000 vulnerable devices

635
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,089
appear in Internet I was going to be

636
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:49,808
more that's important worth remembering

637
00:39:46,089 --> 00:39:51,849
especially the future ones going through

638
00:39:49,809 --> 00:39:57,219
the billions of them of the finalized

639
00:39:51,849 --> 00:40:03,999
the speech was to focus very great with

640
00:39:57,219 --> 00:40:05,920
5g good technology talk with mobile

641
00:40:03,999 --> 00:40:08,948
operators a lot and the interest that

642
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:12,160
this show how much they think about the

643
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:20,099
security of new generations of

644
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:24,058
communication brings very good

645
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:31,829
understanding I would the future

646
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:35,319
security by security by design if wanted

647
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:39,099
everybody always have a Cisco they want

648
00:40:35,319 --> 00:40:43,989
to include into the products security by

649
00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:46,839
design doesn't guarantee that there

650
00:40:43,989 --> 00:40:52,779
won't be any gaps or failures but the

651
00:40:46,839 --> 00:41:00,219
whole paradigm has changed and what can

652
00:40:52,779 --> 00:41:02,849
see the level of maturity is growing we

653
00:41:00,219 --> 00:41:05,739
have to wait until the first year

654
00:41:02,849 --> 00:41:10,690
networks will come they appear in Korea

655
00:41:05,739 --> 00:41:14,039
Japan US UK and till 2019 Russian

656
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:18,490
operators will try to pilot first zones

657
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:22,089
with 5g and maybe in 2021

658
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:24,848
user given frequencies food will be a

659
00:41:22,089 --> 00:41:27,820
pleasure to test this technologists get

660
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:32,080
rise to the speed of uploader zone so we

661
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:35,290
are expecting to enter a better life

662
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:47,290
Thank you Thank You Dmitry do you have

663
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:49,029
any questions to the speaker will give

664
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:54,070
the presentation was very interesting my

665
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:56,260
question about 5g security you said that

666
00:41:54,070 --> 00:42:01,119
they have in Japan Korea but nobody

667
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:03,880
tried to hack they didn't try it in

668
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:05,470
Russia or didn't try in principle didn't

669
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:09,660
obsess myself correct lawyers maybe you

670
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:12,430
misunderstood nobody tried to hack

671
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:15,700
we know that it's out there because we

672
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:19,089
are provided to hack it there you know

673
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:31,569
that paradigm there's the management

674
00:42:19,089 --> 00:42:38,980
plane G who transitions very important

675
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:42,670
as then and the thing when we see when

676
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:45,550
operators a lot of attention on given to

677
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:47,470
security managing district

678
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:51,190
infrastructure from the very beginning

679
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:53,740
when they invite vendors in the lab and

680
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:56,589
lab to test solutions is cool when they

681
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:58,569
divide Ericsson Nakia seems far away and

682
00:42:56,589 --> 00:43:01,119
this show what they are capable of how

683
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:03,430
maturity solutionist and operator and

684
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:06,010
vise researchers pin testers and say as

685
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:10,839
soon as these guys finish their tests

686
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:12,550
you run in and try cracking we try some

687
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:15,700
problems but I cannot say that they're

688
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:18,250
super extravagant very basic main thing

689
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:21,129
as most of them could be resolved with

690
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:24,040
the plain hardening you know good

691
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:26,849
configuration in 95% of cases resolves a

692
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,849
lot of problems

693
00:43:31,369 --> 00:43:40,410
globally knows how to defend how to

694
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:43,220
protect it correctly nobody knows how to

695
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:47,160
hack it because there are so few of them

696
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:51,149
well 4G is a very large area it's not

697
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:56,098
just the network but the services can I

698
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:58,770
spend one more minute on it 5 g FG is to

699
00:43:56,099 --> 00:44:02,390
take back something which operator used

700
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:05,099
to have operators gave the world big

701
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:07,710
internet speed and a lot of services and

702
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:10,200
people started to sell content and the

703
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:12,720
connection services stopped being this

704
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,759
purpose access to Internet

705
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,649
what is interesting it's interesting

706
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:22,220
what service I can get to the channel

707
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:22,220
which video buy insurance or whatever so

708
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:35,070
we became a pipeline to presentation of

709
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:37,890
custom no he said how it was the

710
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:41,369
reliance you know this Indian operator

711
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:44,009
very good president I think they were

712
00:44:41,369 --> 00:44:46,349
doing guest production they decided to

713
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:49,530
develop a new business nation decided

714
00:44:46,349 --> 00:44:51,869
that consumer market and 4G and 5g

715
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:54,510
markets are most perspectives and they

716
00:44:51,869 --> 00:44:57,330
in India we cannot say it was a very

717
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:59,040
broad consumption of services they

718
00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:03,029
rolled out with the operator earned

719
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:05,940
three years or tears earned subscriber

720
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:08,609
brace 300 million subscribers how they

721
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:11,580
did it it did digital marketplace give

722
00:45:08,609 --> 00:45:13,529
some place Amazon which have a mobile

723
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:18,020
operator on what it means that the

724
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:21,349
merger will have consumers will never

725
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:24,259
believe them

726
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:27,289
buy everything from Amazon that's what

727
00:45:24,259 --> 00:45:29,839
Susie is doing Rakuten is doing the same

728
00:45:27,289 --> 00:45:32,569
in Japan its local Amazon they built

729
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:34,509
their base network when we heard about

730
00:45:32,569 --> 00:45:38,180
digitalization that's exactly this

731
00:45:34,509 --> 00:45:41,089
collaborators want to become a site of a

732
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:44,448
large digital supermarkets where you all

733
00:45:41,089 --> 00:45:46,219
be consumers it's fine that's a society

734
00:45:44,449 --> 00:45:49,699
of consumption so when you talk about

735
00:45:46,219 --> 00:45:52,069
ecology security you say how to support

736
00:45:49,699 --> 00:45:55,339
this business model because it's not

737
00:45:52,069 --> 00:46:01,788
just about network core technologies if

738
00:45:55,339 --> 00:46:04,430
we talk about good language Margy means

739
00:46:01,789 --> 00:46:05,539
new specification you read interface but

740
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:08,690
small development

741
00:46:05,539 --> 00:46:12,949
so services based and for everything and

742
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:15,769
the security is very difficult to

743
00:46:12,949 --> 00:46:19,069
encompass to cover and describe it at

744
00:46:15,769 --> 00:46:21,229
once because it includes security of

745
00:46:19,069 --> 00:46:24,799
everything digital world and nobody

746
00:46:21,229 --> 00:46:28,939
knows there's no checklist or compliance

747
00:46:24,799 --> 00:46:32,089
that you can go and say now it's fine

748
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:34,459
FG Network is fine it's secure now it's

749
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:39,109
very complex comprehensive task but it's

750
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:40,640
driven by directions business what is

751
00:46:39,109 --> 00:46:42,799
the guarantee for business that it will

752
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:46,879
work I hope I answered especially yes

753
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:51,038
thinking they have other questions many

754
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,039
Oh max two questions

755
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:11,049
hello thank you for their presentation

756
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:14,900
remember Selina I wanted to find out

757
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:17,810
something as far as I know the real 4g

758
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:22,370
network is not compliant to the 4g

759
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:26,150
standard do we have the same story again

760
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:29,620
with 5g and of yes do you were telling

761
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:34,210
us about the reality or about standards

762
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:34,210
no this is a thank you for the question

763
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:43,120
it's hard to describe because standard

764
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:50,050
describes requirements to the generation

765
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:53,509
what speeds lag

766
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:55,700
let me see whatever but in 4G a lot of

767
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:57,860
specific implementations and LT is just

768
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:59,930
one of them if you remember in WiMAX

769
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:02,150
also was considered as 4G but who

770
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:06,440
remembers about WiMAX it was killed by

771
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:09,050
more popular nor acquired LT it's hard

772
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:10,940
to say that specific technology is not

773
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:14,720
compliant to standard yes we can say

774
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:17,000
because those who write standards in

775
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:19,339
fact develop technologies to for you to

776
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,100
understand there is organization 3gpp

777
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:23,870
including everybody Institute's vendors

778
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:26,960
that love it their interests and invest

779
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:29,000
but they want to sell later and of

780
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:32,690
course when everything was reaching

781
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:36,980
implementation could be a bit different

782
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:39,740
from the standard those happens drawing

783
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:42,080
and the built house are not one-to-one

784
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:43,069
some deviations are possible but it's

785
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:47,440
always been like that

786
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:52,610
can I say it's a huge problem its norm

787
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:55,760
in the world we live I haven't answered

788
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:58,160
the question right now you have you have

789
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:02,510
answered but you were telling us about

790
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:03,589
what about the reality Oh only about

791
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:07,040
reality

792
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:09,680
we hate reading papers is one everything

793
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:12,020
I'm telling about vulnerabilities and

794
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,609
precedents everything that we tested and

795
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:15,200
tried together with our clients and

796
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:22,980
partners

797
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:27,839
and I can put my signature under every

798
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:30,750
letter if you have any questions let me

799
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:34,619
try try to catch more quarters let's

800
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:36,660
thank the speaker once again thank you I

801
00:49:34,619 --> 00:49:40,880
would like to invite on to stage two

802
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:48,540
more you know so Phil tell us about the

803
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:51,569
security of bank systems morning good to

804
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:55,430
you all the financial people money

805
00:49:51,569 --> 00:50:04,170
lovers to see financial organizations I

806
00:49:55,430 --> 00:50:07,649
hope you woke up actually yes telling

807
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:11,220
about money where money headers are

808
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:15,300
taking them and how to protect them the

809
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:20,069
financial sector is quite interesting it

810
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:22,400
has many advantages in analysis for

811
00:50:20,069 --> 00:50:29,509
variability search of ulnar abilities

812
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:34,829
attacking and we have some problems

813
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:37,619
obstacles advantages it's very big

814
00:50:34,829 --> 00:50:39,510
measure to understand whether you have

815
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:42,000
the factor we made I noted or contested

816
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:42,930
finish organization or was not effective

817
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,140
this matter of money

818
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:47,790
if you could withdraw the money and show

819
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:53,910
how to draw it from the finance

820
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:59,250
organization bank's client you did it

821
00:50:53,910 --> 00:51:00,750
successfully if not sorry it's quite

822
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:04,700
rapid growing market

823
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:04,700
there's a picture was black and white

824
00:51:06,049 --> 00:51:18,480
amount of financial essences that

825
00:51:11,029 --> 00:51:21,839
through which one payment goes that card

826
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:24,839
for your coffee is enormous 20 30 years

827
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:29,069
ago it was at least three elements banks

828
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:32,670
acquirer Network Visa MasterCard and

829
00:51:29,069 --> 00:51:37,259
issuer bent now you can imagine it's

830
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:41,039
going to be token is recognize payment

831
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:44,599
aggregate payment gateway and is just

832
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:49,819
the first parts doing before the network

833
00:51:44,599 --> 00:51:52,380
card network everybody put

834
00:51:49,819 --> 00:51:56,220
responsibilities you want to another one

835
00:51:52,380 --> 00:52:02,099
financial body says it's not a problem

836
00:51:56,220 --> 00:52:04,980
we trying to talk to Apple pay and say

837
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:07,769
guys really just aggregator we're not in

838
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:14,190
charge of this requires has to stuff my

839
00:52:07,769 --> 00:52:18,419
money what is the problem this problem

840
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:21,569
of the issuer bank but the data just

841
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:24,299
don't reach the bank and they say how

842
00:52:21,569 --> 00:52:26,130
can I differentiate for transaction from

843
00:52:24,299 --> 00:52:29,180
multiple transactions so it's not quite

844
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:32,069
comfortable for them but good for you

845
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:36,660
there's very easy to find vulnerability

846
00:52:32,069 --> 00:52:41,119
and easy to fix it for the past five

847
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:44,399
years and every year have a lot of such

848
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:48,569
features and what is black financial

849
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:51,750
startups replace and a false old-school

850
00:52:48,569 --> 00:52:53,640
Bank services are not fine it applies

851
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:55,470
the different level of maturity that our

852
00:52:53,640 --> 00:53:00,118
banks which understand you know there

853
00:52:55,470 --> 00:53:02,549
are old general of security who is in

854
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:04,740
charge of actual physical security but

855
00:53:02,549 --> 00:53:07,559
the new financial organizations it's

856
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:10,180
crazy I come across situations from

857
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:13,359
people for their level

858
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:16,598
do not have enough knowledge you in

859
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:22,420
financial area how the bank's processes

860
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:25,240
should go and it helps me to find guys

861
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:31,930
who are weaker than others me with big

862
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:34,029
bellies so for - is very big entry

863
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:37,240
barrier you cannot just go and find the

864
00:53:34,029 --> 00:53:38,950
vulnerability like in a bug bouncing but

865
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:44,529
bounty supports to banks the world

866
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:48,129
number three they cannot get equipment

867
00:53:44,529 --> 00:53:50,740
hardware Alexis said in our payment

868
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:54,789
village like maybe had to buy both

869
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:57,240
terminals to bargain in a veto but the

870
00:53:54,789 --> 00:54:00,849
entropy rate is quite high

871
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:04,660
looks like the question is not about the

872
00:54:00,849 --> 00:54:06,460
money but about amount of money not just

873
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:09,038
you come to Banco say we stole money

874
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:09,460
from you in the risk model to ask first

875
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:11,500
thing

876
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:20,200
how much money you stole and week you

877
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:22,029
can steal second how much efforts they

878
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:25,288
will need what is the probability of

879
00:54:22,029 --> 00:54:28,180
this incident this crisp model

880
00:54:25,289 --> 00:54:33,119
nobody cares about five ten thirty

881
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:37,779
thousand rubles like one's lawyer on

882
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:42,880
investigating the bank's incident no

883
00:54:37,779 --> 00:54:46,900
bank cares about losing money from the

884
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:50,170
cards of individuals my grandmother's

885
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:52,779
losing thirty thousand is a death

886
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:56,049
sentence but for the bank is nothing was

887
00:54:52,779 --> 00:54:58,299
not the board on the process that makes

888
00:54:56,049 --> 00:55:00,339
more interesting for hackers and for us

889
00:54:58,299 --> 00:55:02,230
requirements of regulators you

890
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:05,670
understand the damaged bank in vacuum

891
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:09,460
the more secure an average retail

892
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:13,710
company in vacuum with the web in

893
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:16,900
internet etc etc these regulators so far

894
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:20,079
do this entry barrier bit more difficult

895
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:24,829
to their requirements and security

896
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:29,180
that's why last five years I've been

897
00:55:24,829 --> 00:55:33,589
doing financial organizations because

898
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:38,299
different thing tests and searches not

899
00:55:33,589 --> 00:55:42,200
alone that's the whole group assembled

900
00:55:38,299 --> 00:55:44,990
did zoomed team that's reverse engineers

901
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:49,520
Dmitry thank your team

902
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:53,868
these are the people who do we do well

903
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:55,730
weekly subject area like engineers if

904
00:55:53,869 --> 00:55:59,119
for the SCADA engineers you need

905
00:55:55,730 --> 00:56:02,710
engineers last year we have people

906
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:06,609
understands how the ATMs are doing

907
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:12,920
understand how payment terminals

908
00:56:06,609 --> 00:56:15,230
operated so and so forth and researcher

909
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:17,869
I see a task understand that from this

910
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:21,470
organization you can try to steal money

911
00:56:17,869 --> 00:56:22,369
like this or from ATM grass some

912
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:25,339
potential vectors

913
00:56:22,369 --> 00:56:30,500
I collect the team and I say come on

914
00:56:25,339 --> 00:56:35,000
guys we get your result then we get

915
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:38,059
connected Salesforce and PR just first

916
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:42,020
sometimes on this entry barrier we make

917
00:56:38,059 --> 00:56:44,329
Salesforce to understand what client can

918
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:47,329
have the system wounds can become and

919
00:56:44,329 --> 00:56:52,819
who is interested to pen test the system

920
00:56:47,329 --> 00:56:57,380
as we cannot give it out the market at

921
00:56:52,819 --> 00:57:00,529
the end Paris connected to that process

922
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:01,970
to deliver to the people to companies

923
00:57:00,529 --> 00:57:11,150
the vendors the importance of what we

924
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:12,740
found cuz if there's no PR everybody

925
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:14,750
would don't care much about our

926
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:18,020
achievements

927
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:22,040
and past five years we managed to dig

928
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:25,960
everything we tried from regular Bank

929
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:29,810
systems online banks individual legal

930
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:31,940
companies Mobile's every year we were

931
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:35,710
showing great analytics partnering with

932
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:39,820
different banks producers dbo IPs and

933
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:43,310
then it was whirring moved to ATMs

934
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:47,450
internal processing Dagg arm

935
00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:49,849
KBM systems it can take a look at

936
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:52,910
statistics in our website and for the

937
00:57:49,849 --> 00:57:55,430
past two years I'm doing our team is

938
00:57:52,910 --> 00:57:58,069
doing vulnerabilities or protection

939
00:57:55,430 --> 00:58:01,879
analysis of financial tools or financial

940
00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:08,180
in points these are the cars POS

941
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:10,099
terminals ATM on land upon acquiring but

942
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:14,240
none of that initially is a black box

943
00:58:10,099 --> 00:58:16,910
from our system which we don't kind of

944
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:20,810
physical in our hands compliant cells we

945
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:25,190
have a limited model we won't give you

946
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:30,529
to diktats force terminal money bring it

947
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:34,849
back as it was we need to bring some

948
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:40,520
efforts to understand what is it not

949
00:58:34,849 --> 00:58:43,760
work with it but at the cloud come if

950
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:44,990
you have enough time and desire to do

951
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:49,520
the project and project is truly

952
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:51,560
interesting and clients are not setting

953
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:54,560
a lot of limitations like you don't

954
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:56,630
don't do this don't touch that we're not

955
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:59,359
interested in listen that we need that

956
00:58:56,630 --> 00:59:01,550
for reporting then at the output you

957
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:04,430
don't have just papers but we have some

958
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:06,859
cool things and now the systems are

959
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:09,770
mentioned for the past five years we

960
00:59:06,859 --> 00:59:12,020
found other abilities and you understand

961
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:14,839
yourself on financial point of view

962
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:19,400
these are two problems first leakage of

963
00:59:14,839 --> 00:59:22,580
personal data financial instruments and

964
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:25,610
tools and second stealing money

965
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:28,130
and we are talking about first you can

966
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:30,170
steal money from clients these are

967
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:36,560
financial organizations in this case we

968
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:40,090
simply emulate we can open two cars two

969
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:42,770
essences so money one from another

970
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:44,840
instead of stealing them from clients

971
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:48,050
and financial organizations which I

972
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:50,990
don't recommend anybody to do or from

973
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:52,400
financial organization self so so what

974
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:55,959
is the difference where the money from

975
00:59:52,400 --> 01:00:01,870
if you have money the money can be

976
00:59:55,960 --> 01:00:05,390
extracted so because of this risk model

977
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:08,270
only there's the first problem nobody

978
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:13,910
ever cared about attacks that's all once

979
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:17,240
so why steal zero zero one pound dollar

980
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:21,319
ruble doesn't matter if in once you can

981
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:26,839
take out all the money from the ATM or a

982
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:34,190
swift system or arm KBR and get your 300

983
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:37,400
million and go into the sunset plus your

984
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:38,030
rear bank you've got reports you've got

985
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:41,390
a report

986
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:44,600
you got Wow what else you can do the

987
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:50,569
first recommendation address the vendor

988
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:52,990
to fix the vulnerability vendors are not

989
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:57,440
interested to stop their money the

990
01:00:52,990 --> 01:01:05,660
sellers organizations organizations must

991
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:08,360
be really big then there's not

992
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:11,299
interested in small banks don't have

993
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:13,580
enough influence to approach a vendor

994
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:15,680
and say you fix it otherwise we won't

995
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:17,960
buy they say Russian market is zero zero

996
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:20,779
one percent but not intercept those

997
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:22,580
happens there are large vendors to our

998
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:24,470
large clients or these vendors like

999
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:27,830
large financial organizations I was very

1000
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:29,430
angry to be everybody you see every day

1001
01:01:27,830 --> 01:01:33,609
and

1002
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:35,259
commercials and ads that buy from

1003
01:01:33,609 --> 01:01:38,589
vendors for tens of millions of dollars

1004
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:43,990
to them it's important can imagine for a

1005
01:01:38,589 --> 01:01:47,619
sec a situation found a vulnerability in

1006
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:50,828
a system of like Amazon system sent them

1007
01:01:47,619 --> 01:01:54,910
a report numbers on but bouncing Amazon

1008
01:01:50,829 --> 01:01:56,920
which is and says well we haven't seen

1009
01:01:54,910 --> 01:02:00,540
this attack in the wild and we see it

1010
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:04,240
then come and then we'll pay you money

1011
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:06,730
this is the feeling of having for two

1012
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:09,419
years past two years and abilities to

1013
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:12,970
large financial organizations vendors

1014
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:15,310
who says oh we haven't seen it in the

1015
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:21,819
wild when we see it we'll get back to

1016
01:02:15,310 --> 01:02:22,660
you so all systems that you see here on

1017
01:02:21,819 --> 01:02:28,359
the screen

1018
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:31,750
ATMs largest vendors that everybody

1019
01:02:28,359 --> 01:02:35,920
knows by name both systems post terminal

1020
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:39,099
spin pads not these systems computers

1021
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:43,690
with Windows like Alexei likes it's all

1022
01:02:39,099 --> 01:02:45,400
about during for two days in Beijing the

1023
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:48,579
small ones that you insert the cart you

1024
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:52,270
enter PIN code and it must decoded but

1025
01:02:48,579 --> 01:02:57,369
unfortunately it's no this case things

1026
01:02:52,270 --> 01:03:05,170
you can steal money from you and acquire

1027
01:02:57,369 --> 01:03:10,089
Bank and assure bank and intermediate

1028
01:03:05,170 --> 01:03:15,190
service goes from first moment until the

1029
01:03:10,089 --> 01:03:19,119
mines Rick no tokenizer aggregators

1030
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:22,119
source providers last year we had the

1031
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:29,140
research and security for financial

1032
01:03:22,119 --> 01:03:34,700
systems in financial tools you can get

1033
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:39,770
to that b2b b2c no yes

1034
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:44,629
I'll press any questions do you have any

1035
01:03:39,770 --> 01:03:45,770
questions to Timor then let me ask you a

1036
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:48,230
question during the course light

1037
01:03:45,770 --> 01:03:50,090
enlisted that you have broke and this

1038
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:51,860
and that and this and there's something

1039
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:59,780
that deserves attention that we haven't

1040
01:03:51,860 --> 01:04:03,640
reached yet there's a big market because

1041
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:07,330
of this risk model we actually follow

1042
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:13,160
hackers if tomorrow hackers start

1043
01:04:07,330 --> 01:04:15,290
breaking Bloomberg terminals well indeed

1044
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:19,520
there are big money and even more money

1045
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:21,590
than shift arm KBR and banks would

1046
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:24,140
become interested somebody will come to

1047
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:28,310
us and say come on go and break it we go

1048
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:34,009
and so does the following the market

1049
01:04:28,310 --> 01:04:42,140
trends I see what thinkest good up to

1050
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:43,970
the speaker divined the relative will

1051
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:51,230
tell about the security of web

1052
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:54,980
applications hello everybody my name is

1053
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:57,380
narsimha vertically we do application

1054
01:04:54,980 --> 01:05:00,350
security in positive technology today a

1055
01:04:57,380 --> 01:05:03,260
lot to talk about evolution our security

1056
01:05:00,350 --> 01:05:05,450
and web applications our applications

1057
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:09,470
for developing and how the protection

1058
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:11,120
commercials were changing I say there

1059
01:05:09,470 --> 01:05:15,089
are four stages of development

1060
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:19,118
first monolithically well web apps

1061
01:05:15,089 --> 01:05:23,529
then the apps were costing more than one

1062
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:28,480
server all services were focused in one

1063
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:34,650
place all business logic was focused

1064
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:38,560
around the server and for hackers they

1065
01:05:34,650 --> 01:05:46,359
there are some advantages even than the

1066
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:51,599
whole industry HP I cannot imagine the

1067
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:51,598
current security projects after that

1068
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:58,960
connection

1069
01:05:52,990 --> 01:06:02,200
I'm stuck Linux Apache MySQL same time

1070
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:05,950
end of 90s through the first means of

1071
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:09,490
productions both best now most curious

1072
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:24,040
maybe you heard about this open source

1073
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:38,250
laugh this was built reversing proxies

1074
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:46,750
or inline sniffers web server to protect

1075
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:50,730
second-stage certain visualizations when

1076
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:55,630
I started to develop machines we could

1077
01:06:50,730 --> 01:07:00,670
separate database and app server they

1078
01:06:55,630 --> 01:07:05,200
could place them in different VMs and

1079
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:07,300
then we started having new languages we

1080
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:10,180
had them before but page pre started to

1081
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:12,130
lose its popularity and we started to

1082
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:15,069
have new ways of storing them in

1083
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:23,220
addition to masculine scale there are no

1084
01:07:15,069 --> 01:07:26,850
scale my Redis will cash value storages

1085
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:32,189
and business logic I start smooth too

1086
01:07:26,850 --> 01:07:38,610
glass art more logic is appearing at the

1087
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:43,080
clients and Angelica there's a new term

1088
01:07:38,610 --> 01:07:47,780
like divorce process of deploy raps

1089
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:50,310
started giving more attention it was a

1090
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:58,860
separate process

1091
01:07:50,310 --> 01:08:02,730
CIA CD then there's CD and watch started

1092
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:07,070
to appear but was not enough to use well

1093
01:08:02,730 --> 01:08:07,070
as a separate partner you had to rewrite

1094
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:17,460
and route the traffic to your site or

1095
01:08:12,870 --> 01:08:21,050
protected with the cloud-based war third

1096
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:23,430
time is a time of continued ization

1097
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:28,320
relate with the appearance of a blocker

1098
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:33,380
you could contain separate services

1099
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:36,149
manage them and raise them we observe

1100
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:40,920
fragmentation of apps we go from

1101
01:08:36,149 --> 01:08:45,269
monolith into more fragmented system and

1102
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:50,040
at that moment we have dev psych ops the

1103
01:08:45,270 --> 01:08:53,310
process of deployment the Securities

1104
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:56,700
started to become an integral part of

1105
01:08:53,310 --> 01:09:02,250
the deployment process and during that

1106
01:08:56,700 --> 01:09:05,580
time we start having new ways and means

1107
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:10,770
of protection of apps like their grasp

1108
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:13,920
if ruff was protecting outside now it

1109
01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:16,770
becomes closer to the app itself get

1110
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:21,380
connected as a library of the app and

1111
01:09:16,770 --> 01:09:28,350
can see everything which is going on

1112
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:33,090
inside you can easier the false alarms

1113
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:34,609
detect the attacks the fourth period of

1114
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:37,940
time

1115
01:09:34,609 --> 01:09:43,040
which is being initiated which is server

1116
01:09:37,939 --> 01:09:45,858
less it doesn't mean that the apps will

1117
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:49,850
work without servers they remain what

1118
01:09:45,859 --> 01:09:51,830
this term means that the apps developers

1119
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:52,640
don't have to think about the server

1120
01:09:51,830 --> 01:09:56,930
anymore

1121
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:59,960
the deployment command and the deploys

1122
01:09:56,930 --> 01:10:04,220
our app somewhere in the cloud and app

1123
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:07,430
itself becomes even more fragmented

1124
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:14,120
a fragmentation reaches the level of

1125
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:16,730
function is why an application works in

1126
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:20,720
Connexions some components of business

1127
01:10:16,730 --> 01:10:22,910
logic interact with each other by

1128
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:27,790
special promise that's what we have new

1129
01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:32,720
challenges for protection measures

1130
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:36,140
instead of HTTP and analysis objects for

1131
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:39,440
detection measures becomes an event in

1132
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:42,920
source architecture we don't have to

1133
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:46,820
consider only HTTP could be any data

1134
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:48,980
there could be in your event we generate

1135
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:52,250
different systems for example London

1136
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:55,730
could be AWS s3 when you write a new

1137
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:59,560
file to distributed storage or and get

1138
01:10:55,730 --> 01:11:03,440
its telemetry smash pushing whatever

1139
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:05,000
whatever can be here for sure and quite

1140
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:08,230
big attention could be given to

1141
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:12,770
configuration of service apps because

1142
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:15,950
every function has own access rights and

1143
01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:18,290
sometimes very difficult to understand

1144
01:11:15,950 --> 01:11:20,809
what access rights a lot of thought

1145
01:11:18,290 --> 01:11:22,670
components I was just an anomaly the

1146
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:24,020
special utility which helps to

1147
01:11:22,670 --> 01:11:31,810
understand the fan configuration of your

1148
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:35,950
apps using special means log management

1149
01:11:31,810 --> 01:11:35,950
is a big headache because

1150
01:11:36,639 --> 01:11:42,159
the function lives for a 30 second and

1151
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:46,980
it's impossible as possible but very

1152
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:51,099
difficult to understand what was going

1153
01:11:46,980 --> 01:12:06,638
when this function was operating that

1154
01:11:51,100 --> 01:12:09,730
was working also so serverless difficult

1155
01:12:06,639 --> 01:12:12,010
if you know IP secret in Amazon I can

1156
01:12:09,730 --> 01:12:15,369
rewrite the function like DDoS attack

1157
01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:26,350
becomes I mean dough becomes dough

1158
01:12:15,369 --> 01:12:32,849
attackers do W attack clients while we

1159
01:12:26,350 --> 01:12:37,600
spend the limited money she's in the

1160
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:39,550
imbalance of clients she never stays at

1161
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:45,280
the end I would like to say that despite

1162
01:12:39,550 --> 01:12:49,420
of webapps continuing to develop actual

1163
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:53,500
security remains on the same level

1164
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:57,219
because the protection is not catching

1165
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:58,619
up for security of web apps thank you

1166
01:12:57,219 --> 01:13:06,520
thank you

1167
01:12:58,619 --> 01:13:12,449
do you have any questions to speaker not

1168
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:12,449
I will ask the question the modern world

1169
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:21,530
has already moved to server less and we

1170
01:13:17,530 --> 01:13:26,070
are dealing with the

1171
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:28,559
the heritage of fish the PSF HP yes

1172
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:31,080
there are many apps that work with PHP

1173
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:33,960
and working that for the transition to

1174
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:37,860
several s is a matter of the nearest

1175
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:42,300
future in the nearest future we'll see

1176
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:45,599
development of this technology and the

1177
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:47,880
protection measures must not stay behind

1178
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:55,280
thank you let us think the speaker once

1179
01:13:47,880 --> 01:14:01,170
again axiom garage offical tell us about

1180
01:13:55,280 --> 01:14:03,290
the third of our firmware hello dima

1181
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:08,239
thank you for attention

1182
01:14:03,290 --> 01:14:08,239
Chris hands who knows what is firmware

1183
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:20,280
not so many firmware we are mentioned

1184
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:23,159
several presentations for example when

1185
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:28,349
they spoke about IP t supply chain

1186
01:14:23,159 --> 01:14:32,460
attack often one of the most interesting

1187
01:14:28,350 --> 01:14:42,510
ways of implementation of malware is an

1188
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:45,270
augmentation in supply stage started to

1189
01:14:42,510 --> 01:14:48,870
see her to get into virus all the

1190
01:14:45,270 --> 01:14:53,250
problems faced IT kind of things one way

1191
01:14:48,870 --> 01:14:56,610
or another fall into this firmware a

1192
01:14:53,250 --> 01:15:00,330
post terminals often in the codecs when

1193
01:14:56,610 --> 01:15:06,420
they ask to see these are problems with

1194
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:09,090
the somewhere firmware is everywhere and

1195
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:12,630
the quality deserves to be better

1196
01:15:09,090 --> 01:15:15,420
so the first public attack well-known

1197
01:15:12,630 --> 01:15:18,150
one which was the chernobyl virus this

1198
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:21,090
year twenty years old since it was

1199
01:15:18,150 --> 01:15:22,259
attack it was out it was taken and

1200
01:15:21,090 --> 01:15:26,550
deleting your bias

1201
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:29,840
after that the computer was was off you

1202
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:33,650
had to either change the chip on

1203
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:37,600
motherboard or change the whole computer

1204
01:15:33,650 --> 01:15:40,580
it was attacking about 500,000 devices

1205
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:44,900
even by modern measures if it is large

1206
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:47,900
in the back then not 99 it was about 10%

1207
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:55,820
of old computers connected to the

1208
01:15:47,900 --> 01:16:00,080
network so on one hand probably firmware

1209
01:15:55,820 --> 01:16:02,000
is quite well-known popular to press and

1210
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:08,380
among the researchers but the roots of

1211
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:08,380
these problems were heating hearts

1212
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:14,269
22:19 you can find firmware everywhere

1213
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:20,450
and your computer there are tens of

1214
01:16:14,270 --> 01:16:22,730
different from worse by different

1215
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:24,440
vendors you need to update them in all

1216
01:16:22,730 --> 01:16:28,250
the time you need to track them all the

1217
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:34,309
time your phone we have a lot of them -

1218
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:40,270
it's not just OS it's server for your

1219
01:16:34,310 --> 01:16:40,270
chips with the chips and the cars a lot

1220
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:48,019
medical equipment smart cards everything

1221
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:51,080
you see with great level of probability

1222
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:56,870
if you'll find certain new firmware and

1223
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:59,420
as a result mainly unfortunately there's

1224
01:16:56,870 --> 01:17:09,800
the following problem that many believe

1225
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:11,780
this is the secret theory they say Intel

1226
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:16,640
deliberately invented this technology as

1227
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:19,030
a backdoor to embed the malware so that

1228
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:21,860
nobody knows I'm not a following of this

1229
01:17:19,030 --> 01:17:23,809
secrecy theory because behind that we

1230
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:30,110
believe this fuel economic principles

1231
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:34,070
the development of hardware with a

1232
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:39,079
certain time is more expensive rather

1233
01:17:34,070 --> 01:17:42,409
than if you develop certain subsystem

1234
01:17:39,079 --> 01:17:50,808
and this subsystem would perform some

1235
01:17:42,409 --> 01:17:55,789
programs you know when the yellow curve

1236
01:17:50,809 --> 01:17:58,489
underneath the blue producers start

1237
01:17:55,789 --> 01:18:01,188
implementing firmware it's easier to

1238
01:17:58,489 --> 01:18:04,879
develop implement imagine you have the

1239
01:18:01,189 --> 01:18:09,829
error found in order to call devices

1240
01:18:04,879 --> 01:18:13,789
change the block change the board all

1241
01:18:09,829 --> 01:18:16,039
you have to do is to issue a firmware

1242
01:18:13,789 --> 01:18:18,438
users build to service centers and

1243
01:18:16,039 --> 01:18:22,879
specially trained people you can replace

1244
01:18:18,439 --> 01:18:28,929
that I have they complain a robot

1245
01:18:22,879 --> 01:18:28,929
without the Wi-Fi I've discovered that I

1246
01:18:30,219 --> 01:18:35,169
don't have the latest firmware but any

1247
01:18:33,229 --> 01:18:37,909
guy can update in the service center

1248
01:18:35,169 --> 01:18:39,739
it's much better if I had to change it

1249
01:18:37,909 --> 01:18:45,228
and wait for several weeks until the new

1250
01:18:39,739 --> 01:18:47,558
one comes so actually as I said before

1251
01:18:45,229 --> 01:18:50,510
firmware is everywhere

1252
01:18:47,559 --> 01:18:53,329
unfortunately you've heard many times

1253
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:55,579
and colleagues from SCADA said actually

1254
01:18:53,329 --> 01:18:58,699
they also have a problem and firmware

1255
01:18:55,579 --> 01:19:03,889
and the main principle the logo motor

1256
01:18:58,699 --> 01:19:10,478
for the developers security through

1257
01:19:03,889 --> 01:19:10,479
obscurity because the target of the

1258
01:19:10,510 --> 01:19:17,379
devices the hardware should do what it's

1259
01:19:14,089 --> 01:19:21,010
supposed to like terms of reference

1260
01:19:17,379 --> 01:19:24,079
blink lamps in the right sequence and

1261
01:19:21,010 --> 01:19:26,179
provide the good current right current

1262
01:19:24,079 --> 01:19:28,608
to the right contact if the users are

1263
01:19:26,179 --> 01:19:31,279
trying to use it differently this is the

1264
01:19:28,609 --> 01:19:36,109
problem of the user so the world has

1265
01:19:31,279 --> 01:19:39,289
changed a little bit and approach is of

1266
01:19:36,109 --> 01:19:43,729
many people's mind and the the end we

1267
01:19:39,289 --> 01:19:46,019
have what we have as a firmware as at

1268
01:19:43,729 --> 01:19:48,690
the edge of this software and

1269
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:51,570
it's not a hardware yet but not software

1270
01:19:48,690 --> 01:19:56,160
yet because most privileges in the

1271
01:19:51,570 --> 01:20:01,860
systems his own access to everything

1272
01:19:56,160 --> 01:20:05,580
like to memory to data for example PSP

1273
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:09,179
only all the chips that are connected

1274
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:12,120
with the remote access DMC a server's

1275
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:17,780
firmware we always find vulnerabilities

1276
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:22,500
and childish ones it was the industry

1277
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:25,110
where more or less fine and people could

1278
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:28,290
understand that needs to be done to

1279
01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:31,650
write the free software it's not like

1280
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:38,490
that unfortunately it's just passing the

1281
01:20:31,650 --> 01:20:46,170
process of maturation understanding how

1282
01:20:38,490 --> 01:20:50,849
to develop good safe firmware support

1283
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:53,370
users don't update their firmware please

1284
01:20:50,850 --> 01:20:56,550
raise hands who have you ever updated

1285
01:20:53,370 --> 01:21:03,390
bias in your machines it's a good

1286
01:20:56,550 --> 01:21:06,540
audience more than half you your error

1287
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:08,970
we are breathe but to general users

1288
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:11,970
don't do that users don't know about it

1289
01:21:08,970 --> 01:21:14,670
users don't know that they have forever

1290
01:21:11,970 --> 01:21:17,940
not just in buyers but in the network

1291
01:21:14,670 --> 01:21:22,650
card on the controller rate that could

1292
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:25,530
also be attacked unfortunately so far

1293
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:27,389
what we see through examples the quality

1294
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:29,300
of course architecture deserves to be

1295
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:33,080
better even among the big producers

1296
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:37,860
probably that's a consequence of an item

1297
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:41,760
point security through obscurity just a

1298
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:47,759
few examples of several years there was

1299
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:52,800
in 2018 identified the first and the

1300
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:56,040
wild in cooked a module which was gotten

1301
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:57,769
to a financier buyers and got into the

1302
01:21:56,040 --> 01:22:03,569
system

1303
01:21:57,769 --> 01:22:05,849
of course it would not be found with

1304
01:22:03,569 --> 01:22:11,549
modern methods because they don't simply

1305
01:22:05,849 --> 01:22:15,659
look that way also quite difficult and

1306
01:22:11,549 --> 01:22:18,780
sad vulnerability in why five cars

1307
01:22:15,659 --> 01:22:23,339
Bluetooth guards in the tooth chips

1308
01:22:18,780 --> 01:22:26,849
Wi-Fi chips when the hacker can perform

1309
01:22:23,339 --> 01:22:30,659
occult with your system irrespectively

1310
01:22:26,849 --> 01:22:33,569
of your OS Windows Linux don't care

1311
01:22:30,659 --> 01:22:38,489
profound vulnerability sends you a

1312
01:22:33,569 --> 01:22:43,379
package her back and at first stage has

1313

chips

1315
01:22:43,919 --> 01:22:50,039
often a full access to your memory just

1316
01:22:47,609 --> 01:22:51,269
to provide for a speed and as a results

1317
01:22:50,039 --> 01:22:54,209
that's all

1318
01:22:51,269 --> 01:22:58,369
the attacker can irrespectively of the

1319

operational system is irrespectively off

1320

which producers try to hide and say okay

1326
01:23:24,959 --> 01:23:29,669
in the firmware there's a special

1327
01:23:26,879 --> 01:23:31,439
password and serial number with some

1328
01:23:29,669 --> 01:23:34,559
special figures but nobody will know

1329
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:38,249
that it's available because it's a

1330
01:23:34,559 --> 01:23:43,859
firmware now but the would disassemble

1331
01:23:38,249 --> 01:23:46,079
nor don't want compile another example

1332
01:23:43,859 --> 01:23:48,689
in 2015 the Nova implemented in their

1333
01:23:46,079 --> 01:23:51,929
own bio special module which every time

1334
01:23:48,689 --> 01:23:55,139
when Winston and installing the OS was

1335
01:23:51,929 --> 01:23:58,679
installing a service from Lenovo many

1336
01:23:55,139 --> 01:24:02,849
users didn't like it as this system

1337
01:23:58,679 --> 01:24:05,849
there were very serious owner abilities

1338
01:24:02,849 --> 01:24:08,179
found which could perform the remote

1339
01:24:05,849 --> 01:24:08,179
code

1340
01:24:10,559 --> 01:24:17,379
that's what we have as users if you take

1341
01:24:14,289 --> 01:24:22,299
a look and industrial want a real

1342
01:24:17,379 --> 01:24:28,119
Stephen worse there because it's hard to

1343
01:24:22,299 --> 01:24:32,589
get devices they got unspecial contract

1344
01:24:28,119 --> 01:24:34,239
there's certain DEA there you don't have

1345
01:24:32,589 --> 01:24:38,349
right there so this device but the main

1346
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:41,199
thing is to work and the security is

1347
01:24:38,349 --> 01:24:43,329
based in paper and it's very legal

1348
01:24:41,199 --> 01:24:48,608
hundreds of vulnerabilities there and

1349
01:24:43,329 --> 01:24:50,049
colleagues will say that I'm telling you

1350
01:24:48,609 --> 01:24:53,469
the truth why it's so difficult to

1351
01:24:50,049 --> 01:24:59,369
oppose this attacks they said there are

1352
01:24:53,469 --> 01:24:59,369
no effective protective measures if you

1353
01:24:59,639 --> 01:25:08,019
embarrass or you were attacks an email

1354
01:25:04,749 --> 01:25:12,010
or a Wi-Fi chip and the markets and

1355
01:25:08,019 --> 01:25:14,919
actually special markets there is no

1356
01:25:12,010 --> 01:25:16,839
program product software product which

1357
01:25:14,919 --> 01:25:20,318
would be able to tell you whether there

1358
01:25:16,839 --> 01:25:22,809
was an effect or not and say you that

1359
01:25:20,319 --> 01:25:25,389
you were attacked and you are attacked

1360
01:25:22,809 --> 01:25:28,989
if in fact that's the big problem the

1361
01:25:25,389 --> 01:25:31,089
second thing is the hardware is living

1362
01:25:28,989 --> 01:25:36,178
longer the software my colleague was

1363
01:25:31,089 --> 01:25:40,568
telling me that in 2020 int'l wants to

1364
01:25:36,179 --> 01:25:43,149
reject launching dos at their computers

1365
01:25:40,569 --> 01:25:46,119
and many vendors for the school

1366
01:25:43,149 --> 01:25:48,249
equipment like domain our furnaces are

1367
01:25:46,119 --> 01:25:50,739
able to say that oh my god what we are

1368
01:25:48,249 --> 01:25:52,539
going to do before whatever they were

1369
01:25:50,739 --> 01:25:56,530
buying a computer when the old one was

1370
01:25:52,539 --> 01:25:59,099
breaking because that computer is about

1371
01:25:56,530 --> 01:26:02,709
the big block managing temperature

1372
01:25:59,099 --> 01:26:07,989
operating temperature is simply buying

1373
01:26:02,709 --> 01:26:10,539
simple computer x86 applauding software

1374
01:26:07,989 --> 01:26:13,749
and doing what we wanted and now you can

1375
01:26:10,539 --> 01:26:16,089
have to launch the dots often has had

1376
01:26:13,749 --> 01:26:19,119
living long the software the producers

1377
01:26:16,089 --> 01:26:21,479
of the hardware itself we don't date

1378
01:26:19,119 --> 01:26:21,478
there

1379
01:26:21,639 --> 01:26:26,349
firmware after three years rotor can

1380
01:26:24,190 --> 01:26:30,848
live for ten years and don't have any

1381
01:26:26,349 --> 01:26:33,579
problems with the throughput but you

1382
01:26:30,849 --> 01:26:37,449
know updates security updates you won't

1383
01:26:33,579 --> 01:26:40,750
have it that's the next problem often we

1384
01:26:37,449 --> 01:26:43,839
come across the no desire offenders to

1385
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:48,219
remove the defects or fix the defects

1386
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:53,409
because the vendors saw in the hardware

1387
01:26:48,219 --> 01:26:57,579
and the support is not perfect far from

1388
01:26:53,409 --> 01:27:01,799
perfect it's not something that they are

1389
01:26:57,579 --> 01:27:06,460
eager to do but the task is actually to

1390
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:09,159
fix any error in firmware is hard labor

1391
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:11,829
intensive and not everybody want to do

1392
01:27:09,159 --> 01:27:14,530
that because they are not interested the

1393
01:27:11,829 --> 01:27:20,849
next issues that told the problem with

1394
01:27:14,530 --> 01:27:23,349
the firmware must be considered in a

1395
01:27:20,849 --> 01:27:25,659
comprehensive manner even if he

1396
01:27:23,349 --> 01:27:27,940
understands it's fine you install you

1397
01:27:25,659 --> 01:27:31,000
installed does matter doesn't mean that

1398
01:27:27,940 --> 01:27:33,250
it is you are protected our experience

1399
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:38,070
says no simple example we found a

1400
01:27:33,250 --> 01:27:40,260
vulnerability in Intel army Intel

1401
01:27:38,070 --> 01:27:43,809
produced an update

1402
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:45,699
journalist said ok look there is a

1403
01:27:43,810 --> 01:27:48,329
vulnerability there is the update and

1404
01:27:45,699 --> 01:27:55,919
everything is fine but there's a small

1405
01:27:48,329 --> 01:27:55,920
thing the vector with reported to Intel

1406
01:27:56,250 --> 01:28:04,119
so rewriting of and I need to assertion

1407
01:28:01,449 --> 01:28:07,678
and this it doesn't matter what version

1408
01:28:04,119 --> 01:28:10,089
is there formally no questions

1409
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:12,760
there's no vulnerability that is

1410
01:28:10,090 --> 01:28:15,520
exploited but nobody will use the

1411
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:21,659
version which is used there that's why

1412
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:26,139
any protection against that difficult

1413
01:28:21,659 --> 01:28:27,579
attacks is quite complex thing and you

1414
01:28:26,139 --> 01:28:29,409
need to understand how it works what

1415
01:28:27,579 --> 01:28:33,009
makes this vulnerability will the fix

1416
01:28:29,409 --> 01:28:33,950
does and whether it is enough to install

1417
01:28:33,010 --> 01:28:39,020
an update

1418
01:28:33,950 --> 01:28:43,160
we can the attacker or hacker use that

1419
01:28:39,020 --> 01:28:44,360
in the future somehow at that that's all

1420
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:47,269
thank you for your attention if you have

1421
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:54,460
any questions you can ask now or in the

1422
01:28:47,270 --> 01:28:54,460
corridors questions from the first row

1423
01:28:55,750 --> 01:29:00,860
thank you for the representations very

1424
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:11,780
interesting she said that the firmware

1425
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:12,799
developers are not eager to catch up

1426
01:29:11,780 --> 01:29:16,340
why's that

1427
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:18,170
technical difficulties or laziness or

1428
01:29:16,340 --> 01:29:22,520
some economic things is it too expensive

1429
01:29:18,170 --> 01:29:24,620
or what software not simpler Oracle

1430
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:30,410
level or Windows are not so simple

1431
01:29:24,620 --> 01:29:33,800
things why they have this their approach

1432
01:29:30,410 --> 01:29:39,230
to security but different where

1433
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:42,350
producers are not so eager to rush to

1434
01:29:39,230 --> 01:29:46,910
make an analogy the development of the

1435
01:29:42,350 --> 01:29:50,360
software in 1990s early 2000s you had

1436
01:29:46,910 --> 01:29:53,330
standards and it was fine that was open

1437
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:57,290
password and FTP and nobody cared about

1438
01:29:53,330 --> 01:29:59,480
it but then where evil people came and

1439
01:29:57,290 --> 01:30:02,920
they showed up - in fact it's not a good

1440
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:06,259
idea and this whole industry of firmware

1441
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:08,480
is in that stage when people came showed

1442
01:30:06,260 --> 01:30:12,440
and the vendors are trying to do

1443
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:17,500
something about it simple example Google

1444
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:20,089
has implemented or started to invest

1445
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:23,780
alternative firmware for the

1446
01:30:20,090 --> 01:30:29,570
motherboards relatively open which is

1447
01:30:23,780 --> 01:30:31,610
based on Linux or some own R&D why they

1448
01:30:29,570 --> 01:30:35,299
did it because imagine we have a data

1449
01:30:31,610 --> 01:30:37,420
center often servers are there and the

1450
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:42,440
lifetime of a server like seven years

1451
01:30:37,420 --> 01:30:43,970
maybe even 10 there are many of them so

1452
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:48,769
five you say

1453
01:30:43,970 --> 01:30:51,170
the buyer says oh you know one and a

1454
01:30:48,770 --> 01:30:55,310
half years we supported you okay two

1455
01:30:51,170 --> 01:30:56,030
years and three best case so that's my

1456
01:30:55,310 --> 01:31:02,660
phone

1457
01:30:56,030 --> 01:31:05,570
little pixels do that only in three

1458
01:31:02,660 --> 01:31:08,059
years and then it's done so if when

1459
01:31:05,570 --> 01:31:11,360
there's understand there's a problem but

1460
01:31:08,060 --> 01:31:22,490
the industry is still passing through

1461
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:28,099
the stage how development the influence

1462
01:31:22,490 --> 01:31:31,760
of software it's easier to check if you

1463
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:35,180
do some development of the onboard

1464
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:39,080
system for vehicles and you are I don't

1465
01:31:35,180 --> 01:31:42,200
know any other example airplane yeah the

1466
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:43,850
firmware to operate some airplane

1467
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:46,040
subsistence if you were found a

1468
01:31:43,850 --> 01:31:49,220
vulnerability and you simply attach it

1469
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:52,580
you cannot unload you must pass through

1470
01:31:49,220 --> 01:31:56,540
all stages of diversification to prove

1471
01:31:52,580 --> 01:32:02,030
that it's fine it's okay so it's quite

1472
01:31:56,540 --> 01:32:03,950
difficult process well firmware to air

1473
01:32:02,030 --> 01:32:05,630
plan is clear but for home rotors the

1474
01:32:03,950 --> 01:32:09,019
certification is not needed it's so

1475
01:32:05,630 --> 01:32:11,180
simple I propose not to turn the unit

1476
01:32:09,020 --> 01:32:12,860
into private discussion if your

1477
01:32:11,180 --> 01:32:15,890
questions to Maxim you'll ask them on

1478
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:18,889
corridors and go to the next presentable

1479
01:32:15,890 --> 01:32:21,410
attenuator stage Alexandra moussine will

1480
01:32:18,890 --> 01:32:30,280
tell about the problems of individual it

1481
01:32:21,410 --> 01:32:30,280
internet everybody

1482
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:47,260
we're using algorithms using and I I T

1483
01:32:44,650 --> 01:32:50,889
is the AI is the issue for many

1484
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:53,350
organizations we couldn't avoid it when

1485
01:32:50,890 --> 01:32:57,100
we talk about individual intellect many

1486
01:32:53,350 --> 01:32:58,600
artificial intelligence we expect many

1487
01:32:57,100 --> 01:33:01,810
people think in something about Skynet

1488
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:04,360
but in reality we mean and we talk about

1489
01:33:01,810 --> 01:33:05,770
three terms which is artificial

1490
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:10,089
intelligence machine learning and data

1491
01:33:05,770 --> 01:33:13,330
science for you to understand that the

1492
01:33:10,090 --> 01:33:16,110
error of artificial it has appeared

1493
01:33:13,330 --> 01:33:18,100
let's spend a minute to understand this

1494
01:33:16,110 --> 01:33:21,509
devices because often there are many

1495
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:30,510
jokes and myths are associated with them

1496
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:35,200
initially the term of a I meant we are

1497
01:33:30,510 --> 01:33:41,500
exploring possibilities through modeling

1498
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:47,500
of computing models but now it means

1499
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:50,770
that it is imitation algorithms which is

1500
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:57,960
a prerogative of a person and the

1501
01:33:50,770 --> 01:34:06,400
machine learning is a sub area of the AI

1502
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:16,920
meaning that it is such systems which

1503
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:20,769
work like this it was not initially

1504
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:23,440
programmed and data science your

1505
01:34:20,770 --> 01:34:26,310
knowledge often there are mixed with the

1506
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:26,309
machine learning

1507
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:35,199
there are relative things they're

1508
01:34:31,060 --> 01:34:39,100
crossed but indeed when we apply machine

1509
01:34:35,199 --> 01:34:43,928
learning we find new knowledge and they

1510
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:45,969
are always like this when we are using

1511
01:34:43,929 --> 01:34:49,440
methods of that analysis getting new

1512
01:34:45,969 --> 01:34:51,520
knowledge we don't use them for some

1513
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:54,699
intellectual optimization of

1514
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:57,219
international algorithms all these three

1515
01:34:54,699 --> 01:35:04,089
terms are united by thousands algorithms

1516
01:34:57,219 --> 01:35:07,150
are based on data and right now these as

1517
01:35:04,090 --> 01:35:11,739
there are many applications that make

1518
01:35:07,150 --> 01:35:14,920
some decisions are based on data the

1519
01:35:11,739 --> 01:35:19,360
risk is not just in functionality but in

1520
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:23,770
data that they are using and there's a

1521
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:26,589
thought that machine learning a I is

1522
01:35:23,770 --> 01:35:29,230
available to people all you have to know

1523
01:35:26,590 --> 01:35:32,020
is a couple of terms there are many

1524
01:35:29,230 --> 01:35:36,309
courses and you can easily learn

1525
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:40,389
everything they try to load bring down

1526
01:35:36,310 --> 01:35:43,239
the entry barrier that's interesting how

1527
01:35:40,389 --> 01:35:46,840
well interest people can evaluate all

1528
01:35:43,239 --> 01:35:48,159
the risks that appear during which

1529
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:55,750
appeared during using of these

1530
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:58,570
algorithms AI and AI in computer

1531
01:35:55,750 --> 01:36:02,020
security is also well known as the tool

1532
01:35:58,570 --> 01:36:07,780
for protection and for hacking why had

1533
01:36:02,020 --> 01:36:13,510
yes and Waffen fuzzing and Tihar and as

1534
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:17,469
it turned out about several years where

1535
01:36:13,510 --> 01:36:23,230
a lot of research and AI itself could be

1536
01:36:17,469 --> 01:36:27,310
vulnerable indeed all the evaluations

1537
01:36:23,230 --> 01:36:29,799
and models are used our based on some

1538
01:36:27,310 --> 01:36:32,699
static environment and some statistics

1539
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:36,040
we always keep talking about probability

1540
01:36:32,699 --> 01:36:38,398
with which the model is working but they

1541
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:41,249
do not consider

1542
01:36:38,399 --> 01:36:43,919
malicious conditions of the environment

1543
01:36:41,249 --> 01:36:46,769
which in real life could be different as

1544
01:36:43,919 --> 01:36:48,449
expected we keep on saying that months

1545
01:36:46,769 --> 01:36:50,699
of machine learning work within the

1546
01:36:48,449 --> 01:36:54,178
framework of some probabilities for

1547
01:36:50,699 --> 01:36:59,070
example the system is working with 85%

1548
01:36:54,179 --> 01:37:04,289
of accuracy but what if we find such

1549
01:36:59,070 --> 01:37:08,429
data which forced the rest of 15% we

1550
01:37:04,289 --> 01:37:11,699
always have data where the date is not

1551
01:37:08,429 --> 01:37:14,369
wrong and the cost of error is different

1552
01:37:11,699 --> 01:37:22,549
for our systems and the task of the

1553
01:37:14,369 --> 01:37:26,398
attacker is to find this complain

1554
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:30,209
professor of georgi University catalyzed

1555
01:37:26,399 --> 01:37:34,530
these risks to using AI in different

1556
01:37:30,209 --> 01:37:36,119
systems so it's not just about the

1557
01:37:34,530 --> 01:37:38,669
models themselves not about the

1558
01:37:36,119 --> 01:37:45,348
algorithms not about mathematics but

1559
01:37:38,669 --> 01:37:54,749
about implementation and about different

1560
01:37:45,349 --> 01:37:58,860
fair works logics the model could be

1561
01:37:54,749 --> 01:38:01,499
stolen and let's consider a few examples

1562
01:37:58,860 --> 01:38:12,619
of applying districts it's a very high

1563
01:38:01,499 --> 01:38:20,610
issue is serial Russian learning we can

1564
01:38:12,619 --> 01:38:24,268
classify infiltrate initially we can see

1565
01:38:20,610 --> 01:38:27,449
attacks that influence of the learning

1566
01:38:24,269 --> 01:38:30,539
something we can influence we cannot

1567
01:38:27,449 --> 01:38:35,119
influence the sampling next type of

1568
01:38:30,539 --> 01:38:41,999
attacks we can say some of the tax

1569
01:38:35,119 --> 01:38:47,530
influence the access to services we can

1570
01:38:41,999 --> 01:38:49,030
provide data and force the one wrong it

1571
01:38:47,530 --> 01:38:52,230
would be easier to switch off the

1572
01:38:49,030 --> 01:38:56,050
service rather than continue using it

1573
01:38:52,230 --> 01:38:59,018
next type of attacks we want to deceive

1574
01:38:56,050 --> 01:39:02,800
a service in general or we want to force

1575
01:38:59,019 --> 01:39:06,699
more we make a mistake in a specific

1576
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:11,110
class or type of data many examples were

1577
01:39:06,699 --> 01:39:18,159
shown during this conference recently it

1578
01:39:11,110 --> 01:39:22,360
has become very quoted that actually is

1579
01:39:18,159 --> 01:39:24,429
about how to change data to get into the

1580
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:27,518
small percentage where the models are

1581
01:39:24,429 --> 01:39:32,710
mistaken and a few photographs are

1582
01:39:27,519 --> 01:39:35,679
enough to avoid being detected by the

1583
01:39:32,710 --> 01:39:40,380
biometric system which identifying you

1584
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:44,559
as a person next very big risk

1585
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:46,599
this force in frameworks everybody knows

1586
01:39:44,559 --> 01:39:49,749
what tortures the cafe they're very

1587
01:39:46,599 --> 01:39:53,800
popular using production but it's not

1588
01:39:49,749 --> 01:39:57,090
every body who passed in the course know

1589
01:39:53,800 --> 01:40:02,980
there are many vulnerabilities behind

1590
01:39:57,090 --> 01:40:06,130
lovers that are used and cv it's not

1591
01:40:02,980 --> 01:40:09,428
works as there are many of them it's not

1592
01:40:06,130 --> 01:40:13,179
always fixed but it's also used and it's

1593
01:40:09,429 --> 01:40:16,690
quite popular next headache for

1594
01:40:13,179 --> 01:40:19,119
developers of such systems is the

1595
01:40:16,690 --> 01:40:23,710
problem of intellectual property of

1596
01:40:19,119 --> 01:40:26,799
these models could be stolen people

1597
01:40:23,710 --> 01:40:29,469
invent some cool things they try to

1598
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:32,010
summon them into mobile applications

1599
01:40:29,469 --> 01:40:35,139
hard to make sure that they work quickly

1600
01:40:32,010 --> 01:40:38,500
work with a lot of resources

1601
01:40:35,139 --> 01:40:42,639
and very smart people take these models

1602
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:44,940
and steal them deploy in their systems

1603
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:48,429
and sell as a product that people

1604
01:40:44,940 --> 01:40:52,138
invented let us not embed it into

1605
01:40:48,429 --> 01:40:56,080
specific apps and give clients let's

1606
01:40:52,139 --> 01:40:58,630
provide that as a service and they will

1607
01:40:56,080 --> 01:41:06,369
address an IP and there were many

1608
01:40:58,630 --> 01:41:09,690
researches but how these models can the

1609
01:41:06,369 --> 01:41:14,290
models be copied by answers and use them

1610
01:41:09,690 --> 01:41:17,830
in their purposes and there are many

1611
01:41:14,290 --> 01:41:19,869
works and papers like that and during

1612
01:41:17,830 --> 01:41:22,780
our conference has been discussed I

1613
01:41:19,869 --> 01:41:28,239
guess yesterday one more important

1614
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:37,090
issues biometric spoofing interesting

1615
01:41:28,239 --> 01:41:40,360
Lane all the attacks in fact are

1616
01:41:37,090 --> 01:41:42,880
developed not just to deceive a specific

1617
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:48,880
system possibility of modeling have a

1618
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:51,330
face and some realistic imaging are used

1619
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:56,860
to the game industry and it's quite

1620
01:41:51,330 --> 01:42:02,670
successfully used but smart people learn

1621
01:41:56,860 --> 01:42:09,030
to use that in their purposes and people

1622
01:42:02,670 --> 01:42:14,159
do biometric systems and unification

1623
01:42:09,030 --> 01:42:14,159
have a constant headache

1624
01:42:14,550 --> 01:42:22,690
[Music]

1625
01:42:17,219 --> 01:42:27,570
and the people who are an opposite part

1626
01:42:22,690 --> 01:42:27,570
of their interests at first

1627
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:39,820
they learn from the page with the

1628
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:43,869
photograph and the others ask people to

1629
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:46,929
move and the hackers build three models

1630
01:42:43,869 --> 01:42:49,210
that replicate movements they people who

1631
01:42:46,929 --> 01:42:51,040
do biometric systems and read that

1632
01:42:49,210 --> 01:42:52,900
something else like they say for the

1633
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:57,250
sensor let us highlight the face and

1634
01:42:52,900 --> 01:43:01,888
then on the reaction to the sensors we

1635
01:42:57,250 --> 01:43:07,199
can define but it is a real person or a

1636
01:43:01,889 --> 01:43:10,409
spoofing and as a return hackers

1637
01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:12,759
invented masks that continue to spoof

1638
01:43:10,409 --> 01:43:15,929
expensive biometric systems and at the

1639
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:18,340
end of like to say and fought in a mask

1640
01:43:15,929 --> 01:43:21,940
the base of progress and artificial

1641
01:43:18,340 --> 01:43:24,159
intelligence is incredibly fast unless

1642
01:43:21,940 --> 01:43:27,250
you have direct exposure to groups like

1643
01:43:24,159 --> 01:43:29,049
deep mind you have no idea how fast it

1644
01:43:27,250 --> 01:43:32,050
is growing at the pace close to

1645
01:43:29,050 --> 01:43:34,300
exponential risk of something seriously

1646
01:43:32,050 --> 01:43:39,510
dangerous happening in the five-year

1647
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:39,510
time frame ten years at most

1648
01:43:42,420 --> 01:43:51,790
thank you for your attention thank you

1649
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:53,280
are there any questions then I have a

1650
01:43:51,790 --> 01:43:56,410
question

1651
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:59,410
masks prediction in ten years from have

1652
01:43:56,410 --> 01:44:02,349
problems are there in chances to avoid

1653
01:43:59,410 --> 01:44:06,910
that simply jumping off machine learning

1654
01:44:02,350 --> 01:44:11,110
or we depend on it so deep it's too late

1655
01:44:06,910 --> 01:44:13,660
well now it's very difficult to jump of

1656
01:44:11,110 --> 01:44:17,339
it because in the programs available to

1657
01:44:13,660 --> 01:44:20,739
many countries like us China and Russia

1658
01:44:17,340 --> 01:44:26,770
development of AI is embedded in its

1659
01:44:20,739 --> 01:44:29,230
continuing we cannot do that some

1660
01:44:26,770 --> 01:44:31,210
business tasks are result so quicker and

1661
01:44:29,230 --> 01:44:33,400
most effective when people are thinking

1662
01:44:31,210 --> 01:44:35,380
about solving of the problem first

1663
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:38,739
rather than resolving the security

1664
01:44:35,380 --> 01:44:45,160
related issues that's it thank you

1665
01:44:38,739 --> 01:44:48,129
let us thank the speaker once again like

1666
01:44:45,160 --> 01:44:50,710
to come to stage our last speaker Nikhil

1667
01:44:48,130 --> 01:45:00,820
I understand he'll tell us about the

1668
01:44:50,710 --> 01:45:05,140
security of mobile apps hello my name is

1669
01:45:00,820 --> 01:45:08,230
Nikhil I'm together with experts I do

1670
01:45:05,140 --> 01:45:12,510
the mobile apps security and today I

1671
01:45:08,230 --> 01:45:15,218
would like to talk about improvement of

1672
01:45:12,510 --> 01:45:17,860
security in mobile apps and mobile

1673
01:45:15,219 --> 01:45:23,230
devices what's wrong with them so trust

1674
01:45:17,860 --> 01:45:28,150
them and so on a few words about obvious

1675
01:45:23,230 --> 01:45:32,379
things let's mention what is mobile

1676
01:45:28,150 --> 01:45:36,070
device mobile device can launch apps can

1677
01:45:32,380 --> 01:45:39,660
connect to computers we can and to

1678
01:45:36,070 --> 01:45:43,049
Internet and do other different things

1679
01:45:39,660 --> 01:45:47,110
also there's only picture about mobile

1680
01:45:43,050 --> 01:45:50,470
devices could be stolen or lost and you

1681
01:45:47,110 --> 01:45:53,500
must remember about what about mobile

1682
01:45:50,470 --> 01:45:55,900
lab maybe many people know but let me

1683
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:59,080
repeat that a while I am strongly have

1684
01:45:55,900 --> 01:46:02,559
client-server architecture what we stole

1685
01:45:59,080 --> 01:46:06,280
at our Android or iOS is blind part of

1686
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:09,120
apps the app itself talks to support

1687
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:09,120
only web server

1688
01:46:16,260 --> 01:46:22,990
there are many ways of impacting the

1689
01:46:19,300 --> 01:46:26,920
mobile device Mary Aero hacker can come

1690
01:46:22,990 --> 01:46:29,620
and try to do something so it means that

1691
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:31,810
you must protect not just the server and

1692
01:46:29,620 --> 01:46:37,660
the data transmission channel body the

1693
01:46:31,810 --> 01:46:39,670
clients apps as well as we heard reports

1694
01:46:37,660 --> 01:46:43,330
about protecting the web app I would

1695
01:46:39,670 --> 01:46:47,620
like to focus most on telling you about

1696
01:46:43,330 --> 01:46:50,640
the security of the clients part a few

1697
01:46:47,620 --> 01:46:53,140
words of statistics from our company

1698
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:57,400
projects mainly these are bank's apps

1699
01:46:53,140 --> 01:46:59,640
what do we see here the biggest number

1700
01:46:57,400 --> 01:47:04,089
of vulnerabilities with a level of risks

1701
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:07,750
come to the server part however as in

1702
01:47:04,090 --> 01:47:09,940
Android and iOS vulnerabilities with the

1703
01:47:07,750 --> 01:47:11,680
harm of risks although in general iOS

1704
01:47:09,940 --> 01:47:17,679
apps show

1705
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:22,030
bit more result but results should be

1706
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:24,400
said within the framework of breaking

1707
01:47:22,030 --> 01:47:26,980
the constants for some reason there's a

1708
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:28,839
myth that for iOS there are not

1709
01:47:26,980 --> 01:47:30,879
trillions or something is very

1710
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:34,600
incredible and we won't even consider

1711
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:38,670
this case in fact no if we understand

1712
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:38,670
how to install the

1713
01:47:38,690 --> 01:47:44,120
malware it's not so simple in this table

1714
01:47:41,719 --> 01:47:48,790
you see what opportunities are to

1715
01:47:44,120 --> 01:47:48,790
install tray on Android and iOS app

1716
01:47:48,820 --> 01:47:54,410
Android we can upload official sources

1717
01:47:51,980 --> 01:47:56,599
from play market but the verification of

1718
01:47:54,410 --> 01:47:59,510
app is not so strong as an app store

1719
01:47:56,600 --> 01:48:02,719
indeed to deployed and trillion into App

1720
01:47:59,510 --> 01:48:04,010
Store is more difficult however few

1721
01:48:02,719 --> 01:48:07,160
people know that there is a chance to

1722
01:48:04,010 --> 01:48:10,360
install apps bypassing official markets

1723
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:13,820
for Android we know there's a thing

1724
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:16,400
click we can install application and

1725
01:48:13,820 --> 01:48:18,980
install that denies there's a similar

1726
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:21,469
system and soon simpler we can go to a

1727
01:48:18,980 --> 01:48:27,919
link press I try

1728
01:48:21,469 --> 01:48:33,560
trust certificate and that's all so if

1729
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:38,239
Android we cannot click refuted there's

1730
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:40,699
no chance in iOS to design if we clicked

1731
01:48:38,239 --> 01:48:43,250
that trusted certificate or Afghanistan

1732
01:48:40,699 --> 01:48:48,139
we automatically install this app in iOS

1733
01:48:43,250 --> 01:48:50,989
some apps can install others not through

1734
01:48:48,140 --> 01:48:55,790
App Store we can stop a tutorial which

1735
01:48:50,989 --> 01:48:59,589
we had once one time why I decided to

1736
01:48:55,790 --> 01:49:03,440
talk about because malware's within the

1737
01:48:59,590 --> 01:49:06,670
security banks apps could a tool which

1738
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:12,620
could be used by hackers for the attack

1739
01:49:06,670 --> 01:49:14,239
in the previous report at the end it was

1740
01:49:12,620 --> 01:49:17,809
interesting thing about biometrics

1741
01:49:14,239 --> 01:49:20,209
attack attacking biometric within the

1742
01:49:17,810 --> 01:49:24,679
mobile app public to say the biometric

1743
01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:29,330
it's not the same security many people

1744
01:49:24,679 --> 01:49:32,980
use fingerprints I'm sure the scanned is

1745
01:49:29,330 --> 01:49:35,510
available most devices face IDs popular

1746
01:49:32,980 --> 01:49:38,330
using this simple ways of identification

1747
01:49:35,510 --> 01:49:40,610
they can pay quickly and nicely but you

1748
01:49:38,330 --> 01:49:42,519
always must remember that this our

1749
01:49:40,610 --> 01:49:44,239
identification is simplified

1750
01:49:42,520 --> 01:49:46,250
identification

1751
01:49:44,239 --> 01:49:48,440
we talk about security we talk about

1752
01:49:46,250 --> 01:49:51,800
security of thought identification as

1753
01:49:48,440 --> 01:49:56,150
such but a deviation or simple way of

1754
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:58,880
entering the apps or payment so even if

1755
01:49:56,150 --> 01:50:02,480
you don't consider the biometric you

1756
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:06,230
should remember the following we cannot

1757
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:08,830
so simply change a finger or a face as

1758
01:50:06,230 --> 01:50:12,730
we what we can do with the best works

1759
01:50:08,830 --> 01:50:17,570
some models of my latest our face and

1760
01:50:12,730 --> 01:50:22,870
finger people can have access to my

1761
01:50:17,570 --> 01:50:27,019
matrix is also few people know then

1762
01:50:22,870 --> 01:50:30,050
which is using fingerprints for an free

1763
01:50:27,020 --> 01:50:31,850
mobile app are forced to store data on

1764
01:50:30,050 --> 01:50:36,950
the device and it's good that if we

1765
01:50:31,850 --> 01:50:38,989
stokin with some short but often

1766
01:50:36,950 --> 01:50:43,370
developers keep passwords that we

1767
01:50:38,989 --> 01:50:45,980
changed also often it also must be

1768
01:50:43,370 --> 01:50:50,510
considered I'm taking in Japan's talking

1769
01:50:45,980 --> 01:50:52,489
about the security of connection

1770
01:50:50,510 --> 01:50:53,989
channels education channels protecting

1771
01:50:52,489 --> 01:50:57,169
data during suspicion many people

1772
01:50:53,989 --> 01:51:00,200
learned how to use coding so practically

1773
01:50:57,170 --> 01:51:07,370
not possible to see the biobank

1774
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:13,489
not using that however there are ways of

1775
01:51:07,370 --> 01:51:19,910
bypassing these mechanisms you don't

1776
01:51:13,489 --> 01:51:23,330
have to be in the untrusted Network and

1777
01:51:19,910 --> 01:51:26,960
connect Wi-Fi Rota afraid to be at that

1778
01:51:23,330 --> 01:51:29,400
because it's very popular proxy servers

1779
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:33,869
and VPN

1780
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:37,759
Roxxxy and Vivienne supposed to stop

1781
01:51:33,869 --> 01:51:40,710
when you might unsaved because safety is

1782
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:42,000
means anonymous but it may be the source

1783
01:51:40,710 --> 01:51:43,980
of your problem because if you don't

1784
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:46,800
trust I will provide that and then

1785
01:51:43,980 --> 01:51:49,888
approaches ever who got from the first

1786
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:54,659
page of Google could be several problems

1787
01:51:49,889 --> 01:51:56,760
developers although use including their

1788
01:51:54,659 --> 01:52:00,199
apps don't always use it correctly

1789
01:51:56,760 --> 01:52:04,409
there's a technology when certificates

1790
01:52:00,199 --> 01:52:06,839
is emitted into app code and often

1791
01:52:04,409 --> 01:52:10,949
developers and implementing this

1792
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:16,440
technology I forget to put it into all

1793
01:52:10,949 --> 01:52:20,638
components so if interaction by P Bank

1794
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:23,638
is protected and it will not work if the

1795
01:52:20,639 --> 01:52:25,590
network is not trusted and webview as a

1796
01:52:23,639 --> 01:52:30,020
component looks like a browser in mobile

1797
01:52:25,590 --> 01:52:34,550
apps then it would happily accept the

1798
01:52:30,020 --> 01:52:40,260
certificates and threaten our security

1799
01:52:34,550 --> 01:52:45,210
and we can see statistics different

1800
01:52:40,260 --> 01:52:54,540
levels of risk as receivable durability

1801
01:52:45,210 --> 01:52:56,639
with high risks repeating the code

1802
01:52:54,540 --> 01:53:00,300
registered % as I mentioned about

1803
01:52:56,639 --> 01:53:03,300
identification biometrics it's also

1804
01:53:00,300 --> 01:53:06,210
vulnerability when application without

1805
01:53:03,300 --> 01:53:10,080
tokens with the short lifetime storing

1806
01:53:06,210 --> 01:53:13,880
your passwords and wrinkles the pin

1807
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:18,960
codes could be chosen some banks

1808
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:23,369
identification is local store

1809
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:27,210
token would be used in the app should be

1810
01:53:23,369 --> 01:53:29,759
noted that similar to web apps as a

1811
01:53:27,210 --> 01:53:31,860
preventive measures use Application

1812
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:35,620
Firewall and mobile apps it's not the

1813
01:53:31,860 --> 01:53:39,920
most successful experience in practice

1814
01:53:35,620 --> 01:53:44,599
the debugging mechanisms are not so

1815
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:49,070
often as before whatever prevents hacker

1816
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:51,230
to search for vulnerabilities used rare

1817
01:53:49,070 --> 01:53:53,780
in our experience we just had one app

1818
01:53:51,230 --> 01:53:57,290
which was using all of these means and

1819
01:53:53,780 --> 01:54:01,840
indeed it was not easy to approach it

1820
01:53:57,290 --> 01:54:04,700
most of mobile banks are not using the

1821
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:07,430
simple deletion of names and classes

1822
01:54:04,700 --> 01:54:10,670
from codes which make hackers life

1823
01:54:07,430 --> 01:54:12,530
easier finding vulnerabilities and

1824
01:54:10,670 --> 01:54:15,860
attacking that's all I have I would like

1825
01:54:12,530 --> 01:54:18,889
to ask answer the questions Thank You

1826
01:54:15,860 --> 01:54:23,469
Nikolai do you have any questions I see

1827
01:54:18,890 --> 01:54:23,470
a question in the room and the audience

1828
01:54:25,750 --> 01:54:31,030
thank you for the presentation

1829
01:54:27,860 --> 01:54:35,080
/ gives you another practical question

1830
01:54:31,030 --> 01:54:42,200
there's a mobile browser chance in

1831
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:44,809
different apps too quickly the page that

1832
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:49,820
was sent as a link what the security is

1833
01:54:44,810 --> 01:54:56,450
using this should understand it should

1834
01:54:49,820 --> 01:54:59,059
specify rather it's easier in one case

1835
01:54:56,450 --> 01:55:05,030
of talk about linking of your data into

1836
01:54:59,060 --> 01:55:08,020
other apps like watch the page in the

1837
01:55:05,030 --> 01:55:10,700
inbuilt browser in the inbuilt browser

1838
01:55:08,020 --> 01:55:13,520
get authorized if you don't trust the

1839
01:55:10,700 --> 01:55:18,019
app which we using the world of apps you

1840
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:25,300
must not watch the page there on another

1841
01:55:18,020 --> 01:55:31,130
hand they this mechanism can protect us

1842
01:55:25,300 --> 01:55:36,110
from moving to links where we are

1843
01:55:31,130 --> 01:55:37,940
already authorized somebody brings us

1844
01:55:36,110 --> 01:55:40,009
vector exercise it will not work because

1845
01:55:37,940 --> 01:55:41,339
we are not authorized in this embedded

1846
01:55:40,010 --> 01:55:44,680
browser

1847
01:55:41,340 --> 01:55:49,480
also these browsers there are attacks

1848
01:55:44,680 --> 01:55:51,730
when hacker can exploit vulnerabilities

1849
01:55:49,480 --> 01:55:54,900
in the inbuilt browser and have access

1850
01:55:51,730 --> 01:55:59,080
completed to an app and manipulated

1851
01:55:54,900 --> 01:56:05,019
through it so it's hard to answer in one

1852
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:08,800
way something like that thank you last

1853
01:56:05,020 --> 01:56:10,870
question there's next section is

1854
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:13,390
something thank you for the report

1855
01:56:10,870 --> 01:56:17,260
question have you tested the mobile apps

1856
01:56:13,390 --> 01:56:19,240
on protection against a Soviet man maybe

1857
01:56:17,260 --> 01:56:22,030
using some intermediate certificate

1858
01:56:19,240 --> 01:56:26,820
whatever it was I couldn't hear you well

1859
01:56:22,030 --> 01:56:30,849
every tested mobile apps mobile banks

1860
01:56:26,820 --> 01:56:33,090
against as a seven-week man and through

1861
01:56:30,850 --> 01:56:38,070
the proxy as you said there's a

1862
01:56:33,090 --> 01:56:42,580
interception traffic yes we do that

1863
01:56:38,070 --> 01:56:47,740
every mobile app surprisingly in some

1864
01:56:42,580 --> 01:56:50,530
banks apps is forgotten functionality

1865
01:56:47,740 --> 01:56:53,820
which developers use which is the

1866
01:56:50,530 --> 01:56:57,910
following we accept any certificates

1867
01:56:53,820 --> 01:57:01,929
even when the attack any certificate

1868
01:56:57,910 --> 01:57:03,880
either hacker or developer this is

1869
01:57:01,930 --> 01:57:07,300
forgotten and mobile apps and then the

1870
01:57:03,880 --> 01:57:11,320
Tigers make attack and they can easily

1871
01:57:07,300 --> 01:57:15,970
see a traffic and transfer replace and

1872
01:57:11,320 --> 01:57:19,780
read can you name the mobile bank's apps

1873
01:57:15,970 --> 01:57:23,380
that correctly check it after our checks

1874
01:57:19,780 --> 01:57:26,650
all mobile banks fix this vulnerable is

1875
01:57:23,380 --> 01:57:30,910
personally I cannot name them okay thank

1876
01:57:26,650 --> 01:57:32,329
you let us think Nikolay once again for

1877
01:57:30,910 --> 01:57:34,880
the presentation

1878
01:57:32,329 --> 01:57:37,610
that our section is over thank you very

1879
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:41,090
much who are listening I hope it was

1880
01:57:37,610 --> 01:57:44,480
useful I hope you learn something new

1881
01:57:41,090 --> 01:57:47,590
please come to page D come next year

1882
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:47,589
thank you very much
