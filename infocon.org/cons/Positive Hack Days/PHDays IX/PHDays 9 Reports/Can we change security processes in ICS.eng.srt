1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,039
first I'd like to thank the organizers

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:08,550
for such a large-scale event and

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,860
although a lot of skeptics regarding the

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,820
change of location so the center of

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:18,630
Moscow was looking quite comfortable and

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,039
a lot of people didn't believe that the

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,470
event wouldn't be a success as such

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,630
remote connects location but

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:28,640
nevertheless it is and therefore thank

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:36,000
unless thank the organizers for this

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:41,489
event I represent my company that's

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,930
responsible for industrial security this

13
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:47,788
is after what we do and not being able

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,120
to protect industrial controls and SCADA

15
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:56,550
systems you won't be able to do anything

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:01:00,390
to secure industrial systems I like to

17
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:03,180
make a word of introduction I think we

18
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,409
are here protection as professionals you

19
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,049
don't need to be explained

20
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:11,520
what's God and industrial control is all

21
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:14,100
about what security means let's now

22
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,960
discuss what happens over the past year

23
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:21,869
what trends we're observing in terms of

24
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:26,820
security methodologies saying from the

25
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:30,000
viewpoint of risk regulator relations

26
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,850
how we're going to move about so that

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,329
the industrial control systems and SCADA

28
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:39,408
systems and very closely related to this

29
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:42,479
critical infrastructure particular topic

30
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:44,820
should be addressed properly I think my

31
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,780
colleagues will understand then we're

32
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,490
going to look well beyond the

33
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:53,220
legislative a definition of what the

34
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:58,710
critical infrastructure is because for

35
00:01:53,220 --> 00:02:01,469
Norilsk Nickel it's now the temperature

36
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:04,289
now is below zero so the heating season

37
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:06,949
season is not yet over and so saying

38
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:11,239
that water and heat

39
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:13,239
why of Norilsk is not critical

40
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:16,430
infrastructure will be wrong when it's

41
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:18,500
40 below zero in the streets when the

42
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:21,050
blizzards you know prevents you from

43
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,930
seeing your has any infrastructure you

44
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:26,269
becoming critical so to start with I'd

45
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:29,209
like to give the flow to all the

46
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:32,150
participants in this panel to introduce

47
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:34,910
ourselves and to describe the problems

48
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:39,730
that in the focus of their competency so

49
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:42,530
that our dialogue should be valuable

conference has been organized in a very

72
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:56,989
different way here we mostly see

73
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:59,750
customer signs people and I expect that

74
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:02,000

security I'd like to break this

90
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:51,360
tradition I just like to understand who

91
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,270

industrial enterprises Thank You

94
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:05,669
colleagues hello my name is Dmitry

95
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:08,010
Dorian ski I'm head of industrial

96
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:10,950
establish security practice at positive

97
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:15,240
technologies and today I am prepared to

98
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:20,820
speak about expanding the not only the

99
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:22,229
scope of security - in the industrial

100
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:26,719
and critical infrastructure but also

101
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:29,190
about expanding the entire industry of

102
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,460
information security

103
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:35,190
so as we better understand so where to

104
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,630
move forwards whom we should make be

105
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:40,800
making friends with and what

106
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:45,360
technologies may become useful in this

107
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:48,870
industry colleagues thank you very much

108
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:53,430
for this opportunity to discuss these

109
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:56,550
issues and to start with I would like to

110
00:05:53,430 --> 00:06:02,710
ask everyone on the panel to say a few

111
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:06,220
words about how we security people

112
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:08,948
well there are basically two audiences

113
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:11,470
that we need to persuade if they don't

114
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:14,530
understand the value of our activity its

115
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:18,490
business on the one hand and people who

116
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:22,530
run these systems industrial systems

117
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:25,449
because there's a common

118
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:27,698
misunderstanding and I say let's isolate

119
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:29,680
everything and everything is going to be

120
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:33,180
safe it's a primitive approach and I

121
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,590
think most companies went what left it

122
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:41,349
behind about five years ago

123
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:43,508
understanding that isolating industrial

124
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:45,400
networks will not protect them

125
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:48,840
altogether because there are way to

126
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:52,570
bypass this and here I'd like to ask

127
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:55,299
representatives of operating companies

128
00:06:52,570 --> 00:07:00,490
in the first case to explain where you

129
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:03,039
focus your efforts or maybe business in

130
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:06,039
your industry is mature enough to

131
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:08,979
understand that this is a separate area

132
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:13,810
of investment in a separate risk

133
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:18,669
management area in order to build a good

134
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:23,919
national multi-layer system to protect

135
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:26,740
key assets which ICS and SCADA systems

136
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:30,580
are thank you let me ask for my company

137
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:32,770
I don't see any problem my company to

138
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:35,770
persuade business the management

139
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:40,240
understands the importance more than

140
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:42,849
that is quite deeply involved in the

141
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,830
subject matter so they provide

142
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:48,849
investments in the information security

143
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:50,500
as a representative of the operations on

144
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:53,949
the other hand you mention how DC

145
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:56,099
operations our security unit doesn't see

146
00:07:53,949 --> 00:08:00,580
a problem to persuade operations people

147
00:07:56,099 --> 00:08:05,110
because it's just done in the command

148
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:08,979
and all the way I was identify another

149
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:10,350
different kind of a problem whether if

150
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:12,800
you need a

151
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:18,200
the management sees the need for capital

152
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:24,300
investments it's not so obvious for the

153
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:27,930
operations phase because we as we

154
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:33,900
implement and deploy both a security and

155
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:40,409
the ICS systems the operations are

156
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:43,199
entrusted to a limited pool of resources

157
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:45,839
and their budget operations budgets are

158
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,080
continuously going down this is

159
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:52,320
something that I see quite clearly I'm

160
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:57,660
not quite sure that everybody here it's

161
00:08:52,320 --> 00:09:00,390
obvious for everyone else here the

162
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:04,350
program as such has existed in this

163
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:08,490
company for a long time quite recently

164
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:11,640
when the World Cup was planned

165
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:13,710
we had a targeted program to provide

166
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,740
security for our sites now we have

167
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:19,440
another targeted program to implement it

168
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:23,190
filling information security with quite

169
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:26,190
a lot of funding provided now we need to

170
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:31,110
find the optimal solutions that will

171
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:34,320
address the tasks on hand and will be

172
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:36,360
compatible with the existing systems

173
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,010
that were it's a separate subject that I

174
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,720
think will find an opportunity to

175
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,550
discuss as well today

176
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,410
well Dmitry thank you and you know

177
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:45,540
welcome III was speaking actually I

178
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:50,550
think it would be adventurous for every

179
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:53,699
one of those who raise their hands

180
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:56,209
who does a security to the critical

181
00:09:53,700 --> 00:10:00,900
infrastructure could you raise hands

182
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:03,420
those companies have specific management

183
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:06,150
approved plans to start projects that

184
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:09,810
implement this garden SCS protection

185
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:12,630
system Alexa Martin self why are you are

186
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:17,189
you not raising your hand so on the

187
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:20,939
whole I think nobody is not raising a

188
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:25,110
hand because of being too shy so the

189
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:26,670
picture looks quite modest considering

190
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,520
now that this conference attracts the

191
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:32,339
leaders in the industry know people who

192
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:36,329
have a vested interest in the subject

193
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:38,040
who does it so on for also it could be

194
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:41,040
quite valuable information for the

195
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:43,980
regulator as well so the average

196
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,810
situation we can't be happy with the

197
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,970
average situation as shown by this photo

198
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:49,469
I'm sorry I'm skipping from subject to

199
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,210
subject but I think it's also quite

200
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:54,240
important I'd like to pass the floor to

201
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:57,990
other colleagues as well yes I will also

202
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,520
speak for my company our conversation

203
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,670
with business

204
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,829
may not be without problems but it's

205
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:13,189
productive on the whole and we do manage

206
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:15,480
to prove them that funds needs to be

207
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:23,190
invested and efforts should be made to

208
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:25,620
cover the industrial security theme even

209
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:28,260
though I would really like to find an

210
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,400
answer the question if there is no IT

211
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:33,540
infrastructure

212
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:35,699
if we don't allocated allocate funds for

213
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,290
information security will the turbine

214
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,830
stop rotating

215
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:43,319
will the water stop flowing will the

216
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:44,910
power stop being generated it was

217
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,440
actually quite difficult to find an

218
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:51,360
answer to this question but when you get

219
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:54,240
business people involved try to offer

220
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,130
them a threat scenarios they start

221
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,110
agreeing that yes under certain

222
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:02,390
condition the water will stop flowing

223
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:05,830
and the power will stop being generating

224
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:12,040
this is one thing another question that

225
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:16,670
Dmitri raised there's a question of

226
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:20,589
operating the industrial security

227
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:24,709
systems in terms of delineating the

228
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:29,420
areas of responsibility who will own a

229
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:34,240
certain parts here we work in full

230
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:38,329
contact between production units and IT

231
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:41,900
we still see a lot of hurdles of this

232
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:44,420
way but between ourselves we're trying

233
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:50,810
to solve these problems

234
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:54,760
I would ask Alexei to share because we

235
00:12:50,810 --> 00:13:00,469
hadn't discussed this in detail before

236
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:04,490
the panel discussion I'll tell you just

237
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:07,820
like it is just right so I have updated

238
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:11,090
my CV so if you don't like it I'll be

239
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:13,460
prepared for that circlings in Norio

240
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:16,400
enorus Nikken the management doesn't

241
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:18,020
have the understanding that in this

242
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,000
industry industrial securities

243
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:22,730
importance and when I was traveling in

244
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,140
the field I saw that they had this

245
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:29,540
understanding but the problems arranged

246
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:33,620
when these two entities collide because

247
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:36,459
on the one hand in SCADA in industry

248
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:40,870
control in IT

249
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:43,029
headcount is being reduced budgets are

250
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:47,380
being cut and they don't have enough

251
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:49,510
resources to provide for their

252
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,830
operations and here security people come

253
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:54,040
and say here's a set of requirements

254
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:58,000
we've written them down please implement

255
00:13:54,040 --> 00:14:01,180
so our approach is not just to set the

256
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,480
requirements but we also implement them

257
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:07,689
ourselves and operators also we take

258
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,450
account of the needs of SCADA and ICS

259
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:14,290
people and try to help them I'd like to

260
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:16,990
support a tax sale it's in nobody's

261
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:18,699
interest when they come to you and with

262
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:21,820
their own interest their own agendas

263
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:26,200
it's always good when you're able to

264
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:29,620
show the added value for those people

265
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:33,670
whom you're working for more than that

266
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:36,940
we always try as we implement our

267
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:41,050
projects to show the company management

268
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:43,660
those bottlenecks that may not fully

269
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:47,040
belong to the security area but because

270
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:52,540
it's about business continuity because

271
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:54,670
the right operation processes needs to

272
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:57,010
be implementing for the industrial

273
00:14:54,670 --> 00:15:00,250
control systems so we see those problems

274
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:03,790
and by exposing them we have become

275
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:05,980
drivers and helpers for the management

276
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:10,329
of the company even in the routine

277
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:13,060
operations so in this respect I would

278
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:16,839
ask Vitaly to say a few words

279
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:21,540
his comments considering his huge

280
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:21,540
experience working in North America and

281
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:30,640
based on the best practices that needs

282
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:32,770
to be applied to the Russian realities

283
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:35,709
of course after certain adaptations

284
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:38,079
because I'm absolutely sure that the

285
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:42,279
machine won't work if you just come in

286
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:43,359
here with Western practices this won't

287
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:47,950
fly

288
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:52,720
of course we have our own draw pros and

289
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:54,160
cons and when it comes to the personal

290
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,880
responsibility of people who are making

291
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,089
decision

292
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,490
our Russian specifically says that the

293
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:08,230
level of responsibility of people in

294
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:13,720
this country is perhaps such that people

295
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:15,430
may bypass regulations believing that's

296
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,360
a decision that they're going to make

297
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:24,370
are going to be more effective this may

298
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:27,760
lead to a better value and the and as a

299
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:31,269
matter of culture so Vitaly

300
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:34,060
if I may I may ask you all to share your

301
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:37,390
experience and maybe you'll also share

302
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:40,329
your perception of the Russian reality

303
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:42,930
that you've come back to after quite a

304
00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:49,719
long time working outside of Russia

305
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:52,000
Thank You Andrey indeed I haven't been

306
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:55,240
working Russia for a long time since

307
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,420
November last year and before that I was

308
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:01,510
head of security in a large energy

309
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:03,819
company in North America and indeed I do

310
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:08,800
have things to compare let me start with

311
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:11,919
the main thing what struck me you know

312
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:16,569
the biggest driver in critical

313
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:19,870
infrastructure security is compliance it

314
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:22,809
was like this in the West in North

315
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:25,119
America in Canada but now it's not so

316
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:25,750
noticeable let me start with the trivial

317
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,689
example

318
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:31,929
if you're driving on the wall and if

319
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:34,120
you're observing the speed limit of 60

320
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:36,700
miles an hour and 90 kilometers an hour

321
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:39,668
because you don't want to pay fine you

322
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:41,730
want to avoid this risk because just

323
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:45,460
because you don't want to pay the money

324
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:45,790
at the same time if you're driving on

325
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,560
the road

326
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:49,510
and you know that the speed limits

327
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,250
because it's a dangerous part of the

328
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:53,590
road because incidents occur frequently

329
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:55,440
there and you need to pay special

330
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:58,600
attention of what's happening

331
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,940
you will probably drive slower and

332
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,010
you're not going to have an incident and

333
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:05,110
you're not going to have to pay the fine

334
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:07,480
I think this is the biggest difference

335
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:09,610
between the culture of understanding of

336
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:14,100
the risk in North America and in Russia

337
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:18,520
in Russia the main reason why these

338
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:21,490
requirements are observed we can list

339
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:26,980
the number of regulations the main

340
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:30,310
reason is because people are trying to

341
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:32,200
follow the regulator's requirements and

342
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:34,270
show how they how well they're doing

343
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,540
this will checklist the evidence for

344
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:40,000
sale but the not always focus on the

345
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:42,550
main risk regarding a why it's being

346
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,810
done in order to forestall the incidence

347
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:49,030
in order to save key people's life save

348
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:55,300
the nature so this understanding I think

349
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:57,730
it's a growth disease it doesn't happen

350
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,730
overnight but never there's the culture

351
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:02,380
of understanding the risks and

352
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:05,310
converting risks to action is the

353
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:09,430
process as I slowly started here so

354
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:12,129
focus on the main breaker and I agree

355
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:15,690
with Alexei Alexei Martin sir and on

356
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:17,860
three we know the situation in Medicare

357
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:21,460
Nicolas NeuroSky Niko

358
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:24,870
it's very standard because they are more

359
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:28,230
focused on risk rather than compliance

360
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:28,229
so I believe

361
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:34,650
that's it we don't just automatically

362
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:37,219
adapt the system we don't just

363
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:39,870
automatically faxed on risks and

364
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:42,390
quantifying the risks of however if you

365
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:44,489
don't start this process together with

366
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:46,470
the colleagues in different departments

367
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:49,050
you can explain to them why this is

368
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:52,050
needed one of the positive examples how

369
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:55,580
this is done in the Western they create

370
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:58,050
a link between the tasks of IT security

371
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,850
critical infrastructure infrastructure

372
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:03,110
security and corporal and social

373
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:04,830
responsibility if you tie these two

374
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:06,959
motivations together

375
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:09,570
protecting the customer protecting the

376
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:13,770
environment and protecting against

377
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:17,129
environments and then that is going to

378
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:20,879
help you achieve real results that this

379
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:24,080
link this link works and it allows you

380
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:27,800
to get through to the top issuance as

381
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:33,000
the colleagues have said investing in

382
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:35,970
security as we have seen in our dealings

383
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:42,110
with the clients after the initial

384
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:42,110
budget agreement actually kind of did

385
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:50,250
leads to a gap or a disconnect that we

386
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:52,169
have to feel how to fill and you have to

387
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:58,020
start you have to start with something

388
00:20:52,170 --> 00:21:03,620
at least I'd like to I'd like to say a

389
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:03,620
few words about my ask about our company

390
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:13,820
not because I want to present it in a

391
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:16,409
favorable light I like to say that we

392
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:18,059
have a good understanding of risks but

393
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:22,830
perhaps we're lucky because these risks

394
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:26,279
are very easy to see and our

395
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:28,559
responsibility is projected into our

396
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:31,019
personal responsibe cuz if something in

397
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:33,960
Moscow is something bad happens in

398
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:37,589
Moscow we know that we ourselves so

399
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:41,249
we'll be the ones to suffer so that's

400
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:46,619
why we spend a lot of money on safety

401
00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:49,469
and resources let me share my opinion in

402
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:52,228
the context of our practices I am on the

403
00:21:49,469 --> 00:21:54,359
other side of the fence perhaps well but

404
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:57,529
in fact you are on both sides of the

405
00:21:54,359 --> 00:22:00,059
fence that's right that's right but

406
00:21:57,529 --> 00:22:02,489
nevertheless I've heard three

407
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:07,469
interesting points there are problems

408
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:09,960
with operation human resources money we

409
00:22:07,469 --> 00:22:13,289
see our role clearly when we perform

410
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:17,219
complex projects we are asked to justify

411
00:22:13,289 --> 00:22:20,609
our spending on personnel on everything

412
00:22:17,219 --> 00:22:23,129
else we have to explain why we do this

413
00:22:20,609 --> 00:22:27,299
many personnel and why we need a regular

414
00:22:23,129 --> 00:22:31,738
agenda compliance and this is a separate

415
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:34,759
matter I believe that we have the

416
00:22:31,739 --> 00:22:37,229
possibility to make sure that this right

417
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:40,379
security does not become a compliance

418
00:22:37,229 --> 00:22:43,020
issue we are going to develop the

419
00:22:40,379 --> 00:22:46,570
sustainability of critical and

420
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:48,850
infrastructure I believe we have to we

421
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:52,389
have to pursue this goal as several

422
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:56,169
security specialists and you want you'll

423
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:58,540
agree that NRC and another industry

424
00:22:56,170 --> 00:23:01,630
specific requirements they have played a

425
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:07,210
significant role in shape in the market

426
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:09,990
and its maturity yes I agree I agree but

427
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:17,170
they started they started much earlier

428
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:22,300
I'd like to ask you to say a few words

429
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:30,550
okay we have our own view of the

430
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:34,750
situation this problem per season cyber

431
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:37,510
security issues is seen in the field we

432
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:40,480
see the reaction of people and the most

433
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:45,670
important thing that we see out there in

434
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:47,500
the field is that security guys and the

435
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:50,500
engineers field engineers they speak

436
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:52,750
different languages they may be talking

437
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:58,390
about the same thing but use different

438
00:23:52,750 --> 00:24:06,160
terminology but but they speak different

439
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:10,960
languages we on our for our part we we

440
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:13,480
want to deal not with solutions or IT

441
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:21,309
solutions or solutions to IT firms but

442
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:25,090
to but to find solutions under risks but

443
00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:26,980
also deal with complex comprehensive

444
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:29,230
security issues that includes every

445
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:34,520
security

446
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:35,840
in real critical manufacturing sites you

447
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,389
cannot make a difference between

448
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:45,250
cybersecurity and functional security

449
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:48,950
and checkpoint regime access regimes and

450
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:53,470
in my personal experience there is an

451
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:58,810
example where we were developing

452
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:58,810
regulations against anti-terrorist

453
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:08,870
counterterrorism measures it's not IT

454
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:11,000
but we felt we had to make links between

455
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:12,889
the different components speak about

456
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,510
compliance or risk so we have to speak

457
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:17,000
about complex risks and some about

458
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:20,300
business risks and technology risks and

459
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,580
social risks and whatever risks you want

460
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:25,520
and that has to be put under the same

461
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:27,980
umbrella we have to produce specific

462
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,800
concrete solutions that will work and

463
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:33,260
ensure comprehensive security on the

464
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:35,750
right level and it has to be understood

465
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:38,450
not only by a regime guys or security

466
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:41,660
guys or operation and operations guys

467
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:44,300
this has to be understood by a layman

468
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:46,940
whether it's in English or in Russian

469
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:49,760
yes I agree and here I believe that

470
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:52,760
there has to be a complete consensus on

471
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:56,030
the one hand that nobody polishes the

472
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:59,020
paper-based security regulations but if

473
00:25:56,030 --> 00:26:01,760
it's a business oriented company this is

474
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:05,330
directly related to breathe risks and

475
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:08,990
potential profit losses because you can

476
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:13,460
you can say whatever you want but until

477
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:18,130
the business cycle house does not put a

478
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:24,680
specific money estimate on those risks

479
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:26,420
all other efforts will not lead to

480
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,160
anything because everybody is sick and

481
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:31,529
tired of hearing the same thing but

482
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:38,009
unless but up until people

483
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:42,399
realize just how important that is

484
00:26:38,009 --> 00:26:46,239
financially that that the company is

485
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:49,029
under threat from targeted tax and the

486
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:51,279
top management has to be really aware of

487
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:52,869
this and by the way there is a very list

488
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,789
of stuff is a very big list of

489
00:26:52,869 --> 00:26:57,459
sophisticated threats they have to be

490
00:26:54,789 --> 00:27:04,119
dealt with so people have to understand

491
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:07,359
that now they they are interested into a

492
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:09,789
specific group of attackers so again

493
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:12,460
there has to be effective system of

494
00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:15,489
countermeasures and that I believe is

495
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:20,019
the real driver I believe and in this

496
00:27:15,489 --> 00:27:21,070
regard we can consider very many

497
00:27:20,019 --> 00:27:23,919
interesting interesting interesting

498
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:27,460
questions so the question to all the

499
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:30,759
present here in your businesses are you

500
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:32,919
currently implementing a SCADA

501
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:37,450
deployment projects or have you already

502
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:43,629
deployed it 1 2 3 4 7 8 ok but out of

503
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:48,129
these projects is there a project that

504
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:51,009
has a security by design component I

505
00:27:48,129 --> 00:27:53,529
don't like it because there's a lot of I

506
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:58,679
don't know as a bit of sour grapes going

507
00:27:53,529 --> 00:28:01,210
down there but perhaps regulatory or

508
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:03,730
applied components of security by

509
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:09,730
default out of view out of all those who

510
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:13,629
have raised your hand how is it done

511
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:17,230
function is it practical or is it more

512
00:28:13,629 --> 00:28:20,168
declarative ok

513
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:24,480
besides what I have said regarding the

514
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:27,249
targeted programs to strengthen security

515
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,250
we have investment projects that were

516
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:32,700
implemented now

517
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:35,610
and this is regulated by distributors

518
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:39,080
documents of Ross city of Russian

519
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:41,729
networks and these documents have a

520
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:46,860
specific documents specific section

521
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:48,960
regarding IT security and well there's

522
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:54,168
more work to do there's going to be a

523
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,169
project of with a real regular relevant

524
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:59,510
section so yeah there's no question

525
00:28:57,059 --> 00:28:59,510
about it

526
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:11,370
well our situation is a little bit worse

527
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:13,678
speaking of our joint stock company we

528
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:16,770
take into account the requirements of

529
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:20,640
information security when we build one

530
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:26,190
we've modernized SCADA systems together

531
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:30,240
with our subsidiaries we recently

532
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:37,610
conducted a reorganization when Rosa

533
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:43,549
Deidre acquired row yes was toca and

534
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:47,820
this is a big company that is a zoo of

535
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:51,090
different companies though of different

536
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:55,260
solutions you probably heard about the

537
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:58,939
federal building junior agent capacities

538
00:29:55,260 --> 00:30:02,190
in the Far East and it is backed up with

539
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:05,909
significant fronting with our

540
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:11,150
requirements unfortunately is a little

541
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:15,659
difficult but we work we we are still

542
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:17,370
trying to achieve good results we're

543
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:21,539
talking about investment projects the

544
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:24,719
sound that you have inherited a motley

545
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:27,690
crew of different systems that while

546
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,960
we're pulling the construction of new

547
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:31,200
systems that's a completely different

548
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:35,450
thing

549
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:38,310
I would if the same applies to you well

550
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:43,020
what concerns our

551
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:48,210
dranzer company we just begin in our

552
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:51,720
work I'd like to say that when was this

553
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:57,080
at the beginning of the year I believe

554
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:59,520
it's in Sunday Times wasn't article

555
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:02,689
article about the switching of the

556
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:06,200
whites in the Kremlin next year the CEO

557
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:11,940
Catherine meeting made instructions

558
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:15,480
following a witch following which we

559
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:20,460
within two weeks created a targeted

560
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:21,630
program chorus well so freak news is not

561
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:26,400
always a bad thing

562
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:28,980
so even from fake news you can extract

563
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:30,930
that add value if I understood your

564
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:34,710
question correctly it was a two-part

565
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:37,890
question there are projects are there

566
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:41,970
any built-in security elements in SCADA

567
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:44,040
projects I'd like to a comment offer a

568
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:47,790
few comes about how we say it it's very

569
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:50,190
different from industry industry in the

570
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:56,850
energy industry there are requirements

571
00:31:50,190 --> 00:32:01,440
for embedded industry sources and the

572
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:06,409
vendors in fact foreign requirements we

573
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:10,860
were one of the first who tested

574
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:13,290
security in the context of SCADA and

575
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:18,300
there is no gap between the products

576
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:23,340
were also in the West and in Russia many

577
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:26,730
vendors are formed offers in which SCADA

578
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:29,399
has different all levels of maturity of

579
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:32,640
safety different modifications and a

580
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:35,780
dirty so we try to

581
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:38,990
harmonizer distance it is important to

582
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:43,470
ensure different laws of maturity to

583
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:45,990
different countries you form demand what

584
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:50,040
is needed during the operation and we as

585
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:53,480
a company we offer these solutions I'd

586
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:58,440
like to ask galaxy to make two comments

587
00:32:53,480 --> 00:33:00,600
about the implementation of SCADA and

588
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:05,030
how our functions are integrated into

589
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:08,219
the process and also I could suggest

590
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:11,820
that every idea and it wasn't perhaps

591
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:14,250
alexei will save your words but it's

592
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:18,570
more or less clear what has happened

593
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:19,280
over the past year what things do you

594
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:23,820
think

595
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:27,299
significantly affect the safety of the

596
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:29,250
security of SCADA as a function let me

597
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:34,168
start with the first one on the one hand

598
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:37,610
I'd like to support was in ur when he

599
00:33:34,169 --> 00:33:42,809
said that scale of interest in bed

600
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:46,189
security but on the defender I I suggest

601
00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:49,410
that many clients preferred not to buy

602
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:52,830
such systems because M ratio so when our

603
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:56,730
IT security team was established the

604
00:33:52,830 --> 00:34:00,000
first two departments were operation and

605
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:04,710
project expertise and project expertise

606
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,680
guys the ones at the stage of idea

607
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:12,770
germination

608
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:17,929
the forum joint requirements of safety

609
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:20,149
systems and they these people conduct

610
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:25,070
this project throughout always life

611
00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:28,159
cycles up until goal life launch into

612
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:31,970
the manufacturing stage so no SCADA can

613
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:37,600
be used in real manufacturing if if the

614
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:42,370
system does not comply with IT security

615
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:45,679
however sometimes sometimes say well

616
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:47,449
these requirements have not always been

617
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:50,450
around - there were times when they

618
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:52,279
didn't exist but what do you do if you

619
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:56,120
already have implemented this SCADA

620
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:59,480
system but they don't complain they

621
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:03,589
don't comply with security it's

622
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:06,620
expensive yes indeed we have different

623
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:08,960
automated systems the first state is

624
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:11,390
their implemented but they don't comply

625
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,090
with the security that requires the

626
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:18,170
first approach and the second is we

627
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:19,790
started talking about future development

628
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:21,920
the digital transformation your

629
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:24,440
factories new points and so on so the

630
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:28,520
question here is what technologies with

631
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:32,180
what architecture and what the economics

632
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:36,830
this of these products and programs is

633
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:40,430
going to be like so if we can talk about

634
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:42,350
this and we can discuss it did the

635
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:44,750
different aspects of this I regret I'd

636
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:48,080
like to ask I'd like to answer the

637
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:53,060
second question okay

638
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:55,299
I'd say that to deploy SCADA you need 19

639
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:58,058
or 18 months

640
00:35:55,299 --> 00:36:00,519
there are several criteria or triggers

641
00:35:58,059 --> 00:36:04,059
the first is so legislation listen to

642
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:08,348
framework but what a crying attacks also

643
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:11,229
a major reason major a Russian

644
00:36:08,349 --> 00:36:12,969
manufacturing sites were shut down due

645
00:36:11,229 --> 00:36:16,928
to a virus but that was not less the

646
00:36:12,969 --> 00:36:19,769
main trigger but perhaps you also heard

647
00:36:16,929 --> 00:36:23,739
about cyber insurance separate insurance

648
00:36:19,769 --> 00:36:27,399
if you remove cyber and you live

649
00:36:23,739 --> 00:36:29,679
insurance then the majority of critical

650
00:36:27,399 --> 00:36:36,519
risks in a manufacturing site are

651
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:37,359
insured and a implementation of security

652
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:41,198
systems

653
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:44,140
Alessio decrease insurance premiums so

654
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:47,549
this can be seen as an investment which

655
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:51,819
is going to which is going to be

656
00:36:47,549 --> 00:36:54,880
profitable over the long term for all

657
00:36:51,819 --> 00:36:57,729
those present here who are in the know I

658
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:02,169
believe it would be worthwhile for them

659
00:36:57,729 --> 00:37:04,989
to talk to security professionals review

660
00:37:02,169 --> 00:37:08,138
the contracts and agreements and the

661
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:11,859
normally normally mentioned that

662
00:37:08,139 --> 00:37:14,739
insurance doesn't cover risks arising

663
00:37:11,859 --> 00:37:19,659
from cyber attacks so it doesn't matter

664
00:37:14,739 --> 00:37:23,409
what happens we in fact you have to be

665
00:37:19,659 --> 00:37:25,479
very clear about what's written in the

666
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:30,039
contract because sometimes there are

667
00:37:25,479 --> 00:37:34,439
specific clauses that say that the

668
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:38,319
insurer will not be obliged to cover the

669
00:37:34,439 --> 00:37:40,888
risks or to reimburse the damages

670
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:46,439
arising from a cyber attacks

671
00:37:40,889 --> 00:37:50,759
so no of course you have to be very very

672
00:37:46,439 --> 00:37:50,759
careful when you're

673
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:55,868
when you think about your cybersecurity

674
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:58,660
because if you assume that the insurer

675
00:37:55,869 --> 00:38:00,700
will cover everything no that's not

676
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:06,129
that's not going to work that way so

677
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:08,649
your please read the fine print I agree

678
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:11,740
as regards the fine print and there are

679
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:15,069
also the so-called black swans things

680
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:20,529
like switching off the lights in the

681
00:38:15,069 --> 00:38:28,119
Kremlin but speaking about the critical

682
00:38:20,529 --> 00:38:31,890
infrastructure the shut down of critical

683
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:36,329
infrastructure sites is a possibility

684
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:41,410
now regarding what has happened I would

685
00:38:36,329 --> 00:38:46,240
over I would say that this is not an

686
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:49,149
event this is a process I would say that

687
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:54,180
the understanding is that server

688
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:59,190
security cannot be separated from

689
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:59,190
industrial security or the security of

690
00:39:00,779 --> 00:39:09,880
construction so we're talking about

691
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:15,059
hyperconvergence a lot of companies in

692
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:19,660
the West have projects and they begin to

693
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:25,470
subsume monitoring centers so you have a

694
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:28,649
colocation of SCADA engineers SCADA

695
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:31,019
security and cyber security

696
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:33,609
professionals all the events are

697
00:39:31,019 --> 00:39:37,689
analyzed monitor the

698
00:39:33,609 --> 00:39:39,970
and taking appropriate care of so I

699
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:43,930
believe that this process has already

700
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:52,598
started and and this is a positive

701
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:55,029
process great case yes that there should

702
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:56,970
be only one professional per plant and

703
00:39:55,029 --> 00:39:59,910
we have been discussing for a while that

704
00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:05,169
industrial functional cyber-security

705
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:07,920
same thing but unfortunately this level

706
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:14,440
is not changing so for example when you

707
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:17,200
when you consider security you do Hazara

708
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,450
and other standard procedures which

709
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,730
include all of the aspects that I listed

710
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:24,999
above but I don't know any practical

711
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:27,910
examples in which the topic of cyber

712
00:40:24,999 --> 00:40:32,950
security and information security is

713
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:36,069
embedded I have seen I have seen such

714
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:39,640
cases in the United States but I believe

715
00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:42,160
that we can grow in that direction we

716
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:45,279
can improve the methodological basis or

717
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,960
we can improve the level of maturity so

718
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:50,349
that we don't just say okay these two

719
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,789
these things are the same but so we have

720
00:40:50,349 --> 00:40:54,489
to be more professional and more

721
00:40:51,789 --> 00:40:58,329
advanced or sophisticated in that regard

722
00:40:54,489 --> 00:41:02,680
Dimitri I believe that it's very

723
00:40:58,329 --> 00:41:04,630
positive what has happened in this year

724
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:07,720
in the area of industrials every

725
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:11,650
security and specifically what has

726
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:14,540
happened with what has happened with any

727
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:19,690
ID you know there is this is

728
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:24,740
idea acceptance cycle and one of the

729
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:29,030
stages is rejection rejection of an idea

730
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:33,430
and very often in Russia in previous

731
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:43,550
years and then again on the side of

732
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:46,669
manufacturing people people from that

733
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:49,540
operate dangerous these people are

734
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:53,090
subject to criminal criminal

735
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:56,240
responsibility if they are subject to

736
00:41:53,090 --> 00:42:03,950
even more responsibility they will not

737
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:05,419
get more unfit so when somebody

738
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:07,790
suggested that you guys are going to be

739
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:12,820
responsible for information security

740
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:18,380
they asked to Y so this stage of denial

741
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:22,190
stage of denial or rejection is a real

742
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:26,990
thing we've seen we've seen that many

743
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:30,500
many manufacturing sites people we can

744
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:32,959
becoming more constructive they begin to

745
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:36,320
understand this and they are ready to

746
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:40,130
get involved in the creation of solution

747
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:43,160
ISM in order to solve some specific

748
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:45,800
tasks that they find interesting I say

749
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:49,240
you have a large range of clients are

750
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:53,450
speaking about industries and if we

751
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:59,290
exclude the financial industry but only

752
00:42:53,450 --> 00:43:02,279
consider manufacturing where do you see

753
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:05,509
accelerated growth where people

754
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:09,930
asking stupid questions well this growth

755
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:16,430
most active growth is a local industry

756
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:23,339
by industry we see metallurgical plants

757
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:31,319
some oil started introduction SCADA two

758
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:33,000
or three years ago the they started with

759
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,710
segments in the network so they have

760
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,420
been doing this segmentation for three

761
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:41,750
years now according to this standard

762
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:45,770
checklist and this growth is very

763
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:50,360
different now if you look at energy

764
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:56,490
generation you can divide the generation

765
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:59,280
itself and networks great energy is a

766
00:43:56,490 --> 00:44:04,680
very critical industry in the country

767
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:08,190
they are the most conservative and the

768
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:11,370
process in fact there are take more time

769
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:14,340
but the huge is that if the process has

770
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:18,480
started you can stop it and this process

771
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:22,070
has gotten some traction in the energy

772
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,070
sector and nobody is going to

773
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:28,769
roll it back this process in oil and gas

774
00:44:26,489 --> 00:44:35,009
it's more or less its

775
00:44:28,769 --> 00:44:36,948
sososo experience overall manufacturing

776
00:44:35,009 --> 00:44:39,569
sites manufacturing company especially

777
00:44:36,949 --> 00:44:44,359
metallurgical companies they are they

778
00:44:39,569 --> 00:44:51,799
look motive in this regard thank you I

779
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:55,679
would to continue the majority of ideas

780
00:44:51,799 --> 00:45:01,319
will seem making sense but the relevance

781
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:03,869
on what base you start from the SCADA

782
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:07,949
systems can be different and the level

783
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:10,559
of their automation is very different I

784
00:45:07,949 --> 00:45:14,880
believe that if you have a SCADA that's

785
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:17,640
from the 1950s or 60s there is no need

786
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:22,469
for any information system but if you

787
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:24,598
look at how how this old equipment is

788
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:32,479
getting older again you can have a

789
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:35,159
blackout blackout in the Kremlin now

790
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:37,249
regarding the industries in some

791
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:41,400
industries this process have already

792
00:45:37,249 --> 00:45:45,408
gotten traction and we're talking about

793
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:48,839
it digitization of the energy sector

794
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:51,179
metal the metallurgist started doing

795
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:55,380
this not two years ago but perhaps even

796
00:45:51,179 --> 00:45:58,469
earlier perhaps in 2013-2014 so this

797
00:45:55,380 --> 00:46:02,069
entire industry is an entirely different

798
00:45:58,469 --> 00:46:04,409
level of maturity oil and gas I wouldn't

799
00:46:02,069 --> 00:46:09,919
say that it's so so I'd say that they

800
00:46:04,409 --> 00:46:09,919
are also quite good as if you were to

801
00:46:11,609 --> 00:46:16,529
I don't believe that notice nickel

802
00:46:14,279 --> 00:46:19,229
should be seen as a metal or it's purely

803
00:46:16,529 --> 00:46:23,219
mythological company the group the noir

804
00:46:19,229 --> 00:46:27,140
nickel group has different assets and

805
00:46:23,219 --> 00:46:33,180
all them are categorized they include

806
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:36,450
naval transport energy Airlines so

807
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:44,009
perhaps we have a quite a diversified

808
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:46,649
portfolio of assets but alexei asked us

809
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:49,440
how we support IT initiatives and i

810
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:54,119
would like to share our positive

811
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:57,959
experience of creating value synergy

812
00:46:54,119 --> 00:47:00,920
when it comes to working with IT but

813
00:46:57,959 --> 00:47:05,269
indeed on the level of on the regulatory

814
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:09,180
level we have regulations regarding

815
00:47:05,269 --> 00:47:15,649
information security in different

816
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:19,348
initiatives and we also have eldest of

817
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:22,229
standards there are about several

818
00:47:19,349 --> 00:47:25,640
hundred of such standards and if I come

819
00:47:22,229 --> 00:47:30,359
to a project manager a project lead

820
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:35,328
before the deployment and if I tell him

821
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:37,308
that you have to go through 600 or 700

822
00:47:35,329 --> 00:47:41,059
checkpoints the person may be

823
00:47:37,309 --> 00:47:44,670
overwhelmed but our functions are

824
00:47:41,059 --> 00:47:46,709
functions consists in saving them

825
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:51,119
integrate into the project and out of

826
00:47:46,709 --> 00:47:54,660
the six or 700 checkpoints to take 28 or

827
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:57,410
30 real checkpoints the most relevant

828
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:57,410
ones that

829
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:05,029
that at different stages will be checked

830
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:11,750
and will be taken into account so I

831
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:15,470
believe that this is that the persuasive

832
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:20,720
force of information security and we in

833
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:23,720
this regard that a major driving force

834
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:25,939
of law may taking this forward and

835
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:31,490
developing this and and also regarding

836
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:34,070
the federal law 187 I'd like to

837
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:37,160
encourage everybody present to list the

838
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:42,040
pros and cons of this federal law for us

839
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:47,960
this federal law 187 in fact was a

840
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:50,300
driver so to speak to review information

841
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:52,610
on security in terms of compliance and

842
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:57,500
in terms of real information security

843
00:48:52,610 --> 00:49:02,620
because as I said as I said business is

844
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:06,020
more about making money is about making

845
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:11,930
support ensuring security and of course

846
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:14,810
in every security activity there is a

847
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:17,060
significant paper component and I would

848
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:21,170
like to give the photo @xv perhaps that

849
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:23,570
we talked about 100 the law 100 meters

850
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:32,590
or is it a driver is it a burden is it a

851
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:35,500
necessity when it comes to episode 1 i7

852
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:38,560
we're also talking about by lowers

853
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:41,080
degrees borders

854
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:44,320
and in my opinion the specific feature

855
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:47,410
of this lowest chain of regulation that

856
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:49,600
the regulator has gone for dialogue the

857
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:54,190
regulator has brought together 40

858
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:56,529
largest industrial companies Andre and I

859
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:58,510
were and we weren't just getting

860
00:49:56,530 --> 00:50:00,790
directives of what needed to be

861
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:03,430
implemented as a manager step but

862
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:05,410
together we have stack and business we

863
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:08,620
were coming to understanding which

864
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:12,129
requirements so were real and which was

865
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:13,779
just on paper so I try and call all

866
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:17,950
righty comments that they were written

867
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:21,670
as mostly more like tools so I believe

868
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:24,850
that the law almost is a driver as to

869
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:27,250
our company because we were at the

870
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:29,710
beginning of the process we are now

871
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:33,070
completing this apart in terms of

872
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:35,620
paper-based security and we're moving

873
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:37,660
towards implementations but I just I'd

874
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:39,670
like to mention and the difficulty that

875
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:45,430
we encountered as Andrew Copelan

876
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:48,340
mentioned we have about nine sectors of

877
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:53,649
industry after 13 listed in this federal

878
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:56,650
law and you can't build a universal and

879
00:50:53,650 --> 00:51:00,760
categorizing methodology and in fact

880
00:50:56,650 --> 00:51:04,430
risk came out to be quite different

881
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:08,240
depending on the industry for instance

882
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:12,348
it wasn't methodology that turned out to

883
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:15,680
be most difficult but shipping business

884
00:51:12,349 --> 00:51:18,499
for instance or aviation where there are

885
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:20,058
so many SCADA and industrial control

886
00:51:18,499 --> 00:51:21,680
system are installed on the same

887
00:51:20,059 --> 00:51:24,019
airplane that you won't find in any

888
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:26,029
factory of course it's a challenge but I

889
00:51:24,019 --> 00:51:30,459
think it's mostly for the industry

890
00:51:26,029 --> 00:51:33,619
rather than against it I will agree

891
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:36,829
hello 187 together with all these bylaws

892
00:51:33,619 --> 00:51:39,609
and regulations is a driver quite a

893
00:51:36,829 --> 00:51:43,279
powerful driver is one of the powerful

894
00:51:39,609 --> 00:51:45,589
arguments for a discussion for the

895
00:51:43,279 --> 00:51:48,680
conversation of his business but I'd

896
00:51:45,589 --> 00:51:56,509
like to remind you how this law was

897
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:59,899
adopted I heard for the first time that

898
00:51:56,509 --> 00:52:03,460
the government understood that's a law

899
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:05,470
like this and needed to be adopted in

900
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:10,839
2013

901
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:15,618
since then after that it's you know went

902
00:52:10,839 --> 00:52:20,390
into the depths of regulators and only

903
00:52:15,619 --> 00:52:24,579
came out of the service surface in 2016

904
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:28,670
it was passed to the Duma over it again

905
00:52:24,579 --> 00:52:33,349
disappears for quite a long time and I

906
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:38,119
wanna cry and petia epidemics became

907
00:52:33,349 --> 00:52:40,489
real drivers to push it it took them

908
00:52:38,119 --> 00:52:42,950
just two weeks to sign it after that so

909
00:52:40,489 --> 00:52:45,920
it wasn't only law 187 that became this

910
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:53,299
driver but also the events that happened

911
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:57,079
in the IT and IT security world some

912
00:52:53,299 --> 00:52:59,869
what colleagues we seemed to be having a

913
00:52:57,079 --> 00:53:02,089
rare consensus among the speakers in

914
00:52:59,869 --> 00:53:03,430
fact I do agree over the previous

915
00:53:02,089 --> 00:53:05,980
speakers the

916
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:09,069
I think it was mentioned that it was a

917
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:11,220
regulation of a production of national

918
00:53:09,069 --> 00:53:13,869
interest it's not our national

919
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:17,470
specificity it's a trends of the past

920
00:53:13,869 --> 00:53:21,880
few years in many countries the u.s. our

921
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:25,868
Eastern neighbours Europe are also doing

922
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:31,480
that also it's quite I'm quite happy

923
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:33,760
that you as customers perceive the

924
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:37,650
requirements of the loan through the

925
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:41,319
prism of real-life risk assessment and

926
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:44,829
try it is a desire to be protected not

927
00:53:41,319 --> 00:53:45,550
just a paper document that needs to be

928
00:53:44,829 --> 00:53:49,059
complied with

929
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:51,220
it's this that will help the law to

930
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:54,990
become a really useful tool so in this

931
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:59,020
sense the adoption of the law is a plus

932
00:53:54,990 --> 00:54:01,240
but considering the sphere of business

933
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:03,759
for my company even more than that of

934
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:05,649
course it's one of the biggest market

935
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:12,609
drivers over the past few years for us

936
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:14,890
it's also a plus as you understand the

937
00:54:12,609 --> 00:54:17,619
most important thing that it offers us

938
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:20,319
an opportunity of talking to a huge

939
00:54:17,619 --> 00:54:22,960
selection of customers and what's

940
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:25,839
especially positive is the conversation

941
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:29,470
quite often goes away beyond

942
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:34,029
categorizing and building checklist but

943
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:38,169
about building the proper threat model

944
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:41,319
and in this perspective you're able to

945
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:45,549
switch the conversation from compliance

946
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:49,480
to the main risks and responses so the

947
00:54:45,549 --> 00:54:51,430
process is not moving forwards fast

948
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:54,609
enough but I think it's already started

949
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:59,140
it's difficult for me to assess the

950
00:54:54,609 --> 00:55:01,990
effectiveness I don't see this law to

951
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:04,509
have become such a powerful driver maybe

952
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:07,808
if some extent I represent operations

953
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:11,020
and maybe it would be better to ask my

954
00:55:07,809 --> 00:55:13,880
management and IT security people but

955
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:19,740
for me is just it's more of an addition

956
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:22,050
headache I think if you are to look for

957
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:24,569
a driver I think it's a whole complete

958
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:29,850
set and the feeling of reality of those

959
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:33,240
other threats that have emerged in the

960
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:35,850
markets so the driver was that the

961
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:39,229
management finally came to believe that

962
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:41,940
these are real threats rather than

963
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:45,330
something they're trying to persuade so

964
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:47,850
they started to believe that the

965
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:51,930
possibility of a real attack with

966
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:55,290
specific goals is quite tangible because

967
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:58,980
our specificity is not like you know

968
00:55:55,290 --> 00:56:03,360
lights going on in a room are the

969
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:05,940
certain conditions it could all end up

970
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:07,740
in technology any catastrophe because

971
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:11,430
the equipment the power transformers

972
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:13,259
will start burning and exploding under

973
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:15,210
certain modes and you won't be able to

974
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:19,500
bring them back to life just by

975
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:23,460
switching them back on again so this may

976
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:25,380
lead to a really bad situation and so

977
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:27,980
the management now fully understand this

978
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:30,450
and is preparing for such contingencies

979
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:32,580
just a small point and I'll bring it

980
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:36,689
back to Dimitri colleagues I just think

981
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:42,410
who would believe five years ago that

982
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:46,140
operation people will say that physical

983
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:50,940
impacts of cyber attacks are quite real

984
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:54,240
I think there's some breakthrough is

985
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:56,580
happening right in front of our eyes so

986
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:59,430
you know operations no it's better than

987
00:56:56,580 --> 00:57:03,029
anybody else because quite often our

988
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:06,440
actions have led to situations that we

989
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:09,380
was which will shut down whole

990
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:16,190
substations when our people would come

991
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:20,450
you know cut the cable and as they know

992
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:25,160
it's better better than anybody else

993
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:29,009
so operations now it person 12 properly

994
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:33,210
perfectly and rainy motive gave us a

995
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:35,400
brief story how federal law 187 came

996
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:41,070
into being but I'm sure everybody knows

997
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:46,610
that before law 187 there was a stack

998
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:51,320
recommendation 31 and when it was issued

999
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:56,280
companies businesses and industries

1000
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:59,640
clearly came out to the surface that had

1001
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:05,100
the understanding as opposed to those

1002
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:08,930
who were going for the purely formal

1003
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:12,839
compliance way because there were no

1004
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:13,589
punishment for not complying with decree

1005
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:17,100
31

1006
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:20,700
whereas companies in metallurgy in oil

1007
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:22,290
gas really assists the risks who really

1008
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:24,000
had an understanding of the problems

1009
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:28,670
they purposefully

1010
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:33,710
went ahead initiated programs went for

1011
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:41,000
you know audits started to create

1012
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:44,580
comprehensive systems or securing their

1013
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:47,790
ICSS and now when law 187 appears

1014
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:53,700
nothing really has changed is just that

1015
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:58,820
the a stick has now been given to the

1016
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:58,819
law enforcement and so companies that

1017
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:05,900
just went for the compliance way keep

1018
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:10,200
trying to just be compliant

1019
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:12,210
whereas companies who were really trying

1020
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:15,290
to improve their security even before

1021
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:20,070
the snow just continue going this way

1022
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:23,070
they strengthen themselves up they

1023
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:25,550
transform of course also company some

1024
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:29,840
companies only started to think

1025
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:30,680
about the practical aspect after the law

1026
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:36,560
was introduced

1027
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:41,509
so actually federal law of y7 is like an

1028
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:45,920
indicator showing which company belongs

1029
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:48,620
to which category I'd like to add

1030
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:51,110
something regarding decree 31 those

1031
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:53,060
companies that were really trying to

1032
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:58,420
comply with the requirements of decree

1033
00:59:53,060 --> 01:00:00,830
31 after the new legislation appearance

1034
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:04,850
started no well I feel absolutely

1035
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:05,870
confident so law 187 is no longer a

1036
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:12,850
scare for them

1037
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:15,620
yes colleagues just trying to wrap up

1038
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:19,370
the this but the part of the session

1039
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:21,799
related to convincing the business I'd

1040
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:23,540
like to inquire about your opinions in

1041
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:26,030
your point of view from your point of

1042
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:28,840
view pain test should be internal

1043
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:32,990
exertion external cannot become a driver

1044
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:36,050
to push the company to understand the

1045
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:40,520
real picture to understand all the

1046
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:42,950
existing problems Oh in terms of a risk

1047
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:45,160
acceptability and competency it's too

1048
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:45,160
risky

1049
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:56,060
well I may not fully understand the

1050
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:59,710
impasse but my internal conviction is

1051
01:00:56,060 --> 01:01:04,970
that this thing is just a must because

1052
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:07,570
to arrive at an unbiased assessment of

1053
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:11,089
the effectiveness of your efforts

1054
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:16,970
because information security is a

1055
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:18,770
complete set of activities so having

1056
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:21,319
implemented some hardware is no

1057
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:25,040
guarantee that we got ourselves

1058
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:27,260
protected so I think such tests are a

1059
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:32,600
must and by the way our company arose

1060
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:34,810
them recently lab 8 so FSB tested us

1061
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:39,440
they came to us and

1062
01:01:34,810 --> 01:01:46,430
we intend to keep doing that well it

1063
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:48,340
looks like we have to happy a picture so

1064
01:01:46,430 --> 01:01:51,140
actually there are quite a lot of

1065
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:54,770
problems that we can discuss I will

1066
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:58,910
agree with my colleague about pen tests

1067
01:01:54,770 --> 01:02:02,270
as a role it's a very good way to get

1068
01:01:58,910 --> 01:02:07,540
across to the management but you have to

1069
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:07,540
understand that any pen test is just a

1070
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:18,260
screenshots and it's also quite a an

1071
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:21,890
artificial activity so you have to have

1072
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:24,830
a continuous program just to be able to

1073
01:02:21,890 --> 01:02:29,240
identify trends rather than long wintery

1074
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:31,790
snapshots so I feel that we have a rare

1075
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:34,810
consensus a day and again I agree with

1076
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:43,160
my colleagues in my opinion a pen test

1077
01:02:34,810 --> 01:02:45,799
black white gray is a must it's clear

1078
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:47,960
that it has to be run at the start of

1079
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:50,840
the project's at the end said the

1080
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:53,750
intermediate points maybe by different

1081
01:02:50,840 --> 01:03:01,150
teams to be able to assess the risks

1082
01:02:53,750 --> 01:03:04,720
also concerns about the risks I think

1083
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:06,800
you can prepare a repentant

1084
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:11,709
organizational differences when it comes

1085
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:17,450
to power production some assistance can

1086
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:20,930
be bypassed but you can still organize

1087
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:22,730
the testing in such a way that you could

1088
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:26,200
identify the weak spots

1089
01:03:22,730 --> 01:03:30,000
so yes pen tests are needed the process

1090
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:32,640
requires thorough preparation

1091
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,920
and Spencer should be part of

1092
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:39,000
comprehensive projects but I will agree

1093
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:42,839
of course pen tests are needed but for

1094
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:45,119
instance for us a pen tests regarding

1095
01:03:42,839 --> 01:03:47,609
the penetration into the enterprise

1096
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:50,490
network are no longer relevant

1097
01:03:47,609 --> 01:03:52,770
nobody is going to scared by this again

1098
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:55,049
to answer to ask the question of what

1099
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:57,000
happens if the entire IT infrastructure

1100
01:03:55,050 --> 01:04:00,750
goes down or will tell by stop

1101
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:06,690
generating power the pen test will not

1102
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:11,540
give you an answer to that and for the

1103
01:04:06,690 --> 01:04:14,700
idea because nobody will let the test is

1104
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:17,940
into the industrial equipments of the

1105
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:22,379
first commandment so our activity is not

1106
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:29,280
to hum so you're sure that they will not

1107
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:32,069
be led there or maybe people could could

1108
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:34,010
get across there trying to persuade them

1109
01:04:32,069 --> 01:04:37,140
that they don't first and everything I

1110
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:41,900
believe about 10 years ago I especially

1111
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:44,310
said that as a result of audits the

1112
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:49,950
production networks on nuclear power

1113
01:04:44,310 --> 01:04:52,859
plants was connected to the land via

1114
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:54,359
some printer because it was an easy way

1115
01:04:52,859 --> 01:04:57,589
for some IT guy

1116
01:04:54,359 --> 01:05:04,740
well I fully agree that you can't allow

1117
01:04:57,589 --> 01:05:08,730
in fact on critical systems but being

1118
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:11,910
able to come across to paying from the

1119
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:15,390
internet from the enterprise line I mean

1120
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:15,930
this possibility should not be

1121
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:21,540
overlooked

1122
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:24,390
I represent the operation of the process

1123
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:27,569
segment industrial segments our networks

1124
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:34,078
are separated so when I got people from

1125
01:05:27,569 --> 01:05:40,990
the lab they penetrated our IT network

1126
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:44,450
immediately with a then after a certain

1127
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:47,870
things they got connected to our

1128
01:05:44,450 --> 01:05:49,609
industrial network they didn't manage to

1129
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:54,799
break of course they said they didn't

1130
01:05:49,610 --> 01:05:57,470
have enough time but I will agree so we

1131
01:05:54,800 --> 01:06:03,470
told them guys you have to understand

1132
01:05:57,470 --> 01:06:07,430
that you may not harm or stop the

1133
01:06:03,470 --> 01:06:10,759
production process so and we agreed on

1134
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:13,759
another meeting and then we'll they'll

1135
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:15,620
now try to find vulnerabilities in our

1136
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:19,100
industrial systems but of course under

1137
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:21,529
our control colleagues I have a question

1138
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:24,440
two representatives of industrial

1139
01:06:21,530 --> 01:06:27,650
companies who has doubts that if a pen

1140
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:29,690
test is run on your enterprise it will

1141
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:32,990
fail please raise your hands your

1142
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:39,830
confidence that you may not or you

1143
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:43,520
cannot be hacked I agree

1144
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:46,540
so there are failures and failures who

1145
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:49,820
in the audience believes that they're

1146
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:53,630
absolutely protected at least in this

1147
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:57,590
Carter Network so if everybody

1148
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:59,960
understands that a pen test will be

1149
01:06:57,590 --> 01:07:02,330
lucky and the enterprise will be hacked

1150
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:05,090
or why should they run them when we were

1151
01:07:02,330 --> 01:07:07,790
running to first to pen test it was most

1152
01:07:05,090 --> 01:07:10,340
for mostly for our business people to

1153
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:13,160
show them that it can be done but why

1154
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:17,470
doing it after that so we do it as part

1155
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:21,710
of risk assessment so that in every

1156
01:07:17,470 --> 01:07:23,689
plant every factory we could know the

1157
01:07:21,710 --> 01:07:27,350
real attack vectors where we have

1158
01:07:23,690 --> 01:07:29,560
threads from internal criminals from

1159
01:07:27,350 --> 01:07:32,720
external criminals to cover the entire

1160
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:35,120
attack spectrum and field protection

1161
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:37,160
from them so perhaps the Dmitry as a

1162
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:38,890
repetitive positive technologist will

1163
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:41,288
say something I

1164
01:07:38,890 --> 01:07:43,500
we'll break the consensus that you

1165
01:07:41,289 --> 01:07:49,569
mentioned I will not agree with

1166
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:51,069
colleagues in what I'm saying that the

1167
01:07:49,569 --> 01:07:53,650
pen test can give you an unbiased

1168
01:07:51,069 --> 01:07:58,049
assessment of protection level a pen

1169
01:07:53,650 --> 01:08:01,299
test may only show you one two or three

1170
01:07:58,049 --> 01:08:05,710
penetration vectors even if you run the

1171
01:08:01,299 --> 01:08:12,119
203 pen tests you can't get a full

1172
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:17,529
picture of your network protection we

1173
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:21,130
differentiate when we run investigation

1174
01:08:17,529 --> 01:08:27,909
run whenever we support industrial

1175
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:32,139
companies penetration tests and as to

1176
01:08:27,908 --> 01:08:35,500
basedgod analysis when it comes to tool

1177
01:08:32,139 --> 01:08:38,199
based analysis it means that you just

1178
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:41,310
get deeply into the industrial control

1179
01:08:38,198 --> 01:08:44,108
the SCADA system not shutting them down

1180
01:08:41,310 --> 01:08:47,859
all the way to turning them you know

1181
01:08:44,109 --> 01:08:50,469
upside down inside out to see everything

1182
01:08:47,859 --> 01:08:54,359
that is there what versions or

1183
01:08:50,469 --> 01:09:01,810
architecture how operations organized

1184
01:08:54,359 --> 01:09:05,199
what Latin things are present so this is

1185
01:09:01,810 --> 01:09:07,179
the kind of analysis that will allow you

1186
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:11,948
assessing of the real starts to your

1187
01:09:07,179 --> 01:09:16,270
system to identify a dozen or a couple

1188
01:09:11,948 --> 01:09:18,759
of dozen vectors that can bring the

1189
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:22,929
system down here you're going to have a

1190
01:09:18,759 --> 01:09:25,029
full set of threads that will be enough

1191
01:09:22,929 --> 01:09:27,880
for you to work on for a year or two

1192
01:09:25,029 --> 01:09:30,400
well frankly I haven't heard from a

1193
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:33,549
colleague's statement so to the fact

1194
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:36,309
that I pen testers a panacea as a silver

1195
01:09:33,549 --> 01:09:38,019
bullets to give you full picture what

1196
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:39,650
they say it is one important element

1197
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:46,520
with a

1198
01:09:39,649 --> 01:09:49,519
good Wow effects that will show the

1199
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:52,640
management how important it is to think

1200
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:56,450
about this you won't believe me in one

1201
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:59,140
of her power companies at pan test was

1202
01:09:56,450 --> 01:10:03,110
ran when they owned the entire

1203
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:06,110
enterprise infrastructure and got into

1204
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:09,019
the industrial infrastructure it was a

1205
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:11,719
company that had lots of power stations

1206
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:15,620
and when heads of the production sector

1207
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:17,780
were shown of the results they didn't

1208
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:20,630
even perceive them they said it just

1209
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:23,690
can't happen so when you were showing

1210
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:28,010
them real-life results files from a

1211
01:10:23,690 --> 01:10:31,040
specific workstation of the chief

1212
01:10:28,010 --> 01:10:32,750
engineer with the schematic of the

1213
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:37,310
production system then you were showing

1214
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:39,260
all files from the workstation in this

1215
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:43,280
production system they still failed to

1216
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:44,840
believe so to say that pen test is

1217
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:47,179
effective and then of course you can get

1218
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:50,090
some Wow effects but again only if they

1219
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:54,170
believe in it if they see some things

1220
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:58,700
they can relate to you know operations

1221
01:10:54,170 --> 01:11:01,550
people are right to say that nobody will

1222
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:03,460
allow you to restart the controller and

1223
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:06,230
without this happening

1224
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:11,630
operations people don't believe that can

1225
01:11:06,230 --> 01:11:14,480
be done well frankly you are shocking me

1226
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:16,340
when you say when you show people

1227
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:20,509
something white and this is still black

1228
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:23,150
I don't know how to fight it if you can

1229
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:26,050
share some I'd be quite excited

1230
01:11:23,150 --> 01:11:30,259
well this version of how could happen

1231
01:11:26,050 --> 01:11:32,360
indeed a person who was denying it it

1232
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:35,180
was probably a person who could be

1233
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:38,509
punished for this result so that's why

1234
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:40,700
he took this defensive position denying

1235
01:11:38,510 --> 01:11:45,560
the event but I think he made conclusion

1236
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:49,070
for themselves well hopefully I would

1237
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:51,680
like to ask you to discuss only a rash

1238
01:11:49,070 --> 01:11:56,360
because what you have said goes well

1239
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:59,270
beyond the limits of rationality well

1240
01:11:56,360 --> 01:12:03,200
you can find lots of examples like that

1241
01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:06,440
even in oil and gas for instance there

1242
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:08,870
was a case where you know there's an

1243
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:13,370
accounting system a product accounting

1244
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:18,740
system and the fraudsters who wanted to

1245
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:21,110
steal part of the products would set up

1246
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:24,139
the system is a certain way there are

1247
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:26,719
different ways physical technical IT

1248
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:31,130
related or there's a simple way the

1249
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:32,930
production people don't look up into the

1250
01:12:31,130 --> 01:12:35,360
accounting system they don't use them

1251
01:12:32,930 --> 01:12:38,090
when shipping and delivering products

1252
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:41,719
and it's believed to be normal practice

1253
01:12:38,090 --> 01:12:44,450
in the company so the factory doesn't

1254
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:48,200
know how many units of products are

1255
01:12:44,450 --> 01:12:51,050
issues so we haven't really right here

1256
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:54,849
discussed rules no no it's all about the

1257
01:12:51,050 --> 01:12:58,460
perception so even within their

1258
01:12:54,850 --> 01:13:02,330
functional roles people quite often even

1259
01:12:58,460 --> 01:13:05,840
know certain things and aren't capable

1260
01:13:02,330 --> 01:13:09,350
of receiving them or they just don't see

1261
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:13,700
them if you allow me a question to you

1262
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:19,040
as a kind of operations person can you

1263
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:23,809
share some things can you share some

1264
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:26,800
experiences that you are trying to bring

1265
01:13:23,810 --> 01:13:30,770
across information about any security to

1266
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:33,140
function people is there any sphere

1267
01:13:30,770 --> 01:13:34,790
where I did security people through the

1268
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:41,020
deformation of their consciousness

1269
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:41,019
through their understanding just

1270
01:13:41,370 --> 01:13:48,840
don't innocence certain things do you

1271
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:51,450
have any questions or open outstanding

1272
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:59,640
items that you believe IT security

1273
01:13:51,450 --> 01:14:00,570
people don't understand enough not

1274
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:03,360
everything

1275
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:06,150
sunny and without clouds in our

1276
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:09,059
relationship with IT security but I

1277
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:13,129
think it's more about human nature yes I

1278
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:16,920
do note that's IT security people

1279
01:14:13,130 --> 01:14:20,250
gravitates to the control and Punishment

1280
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:23,870
function rather well I can't say they

1281
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:26,640
that they are not trying to work out

1282
01:14:23,870 --> 01:14:30,690
decisions don't analyze project

1283
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:39,780
documentation but nevertheless they tend

1284
01:14:30,690 --> 01:14:43,349
to you know discover and punish but

1285
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:46,889
maybe well I'm looking at my IT people

1286
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:51,120
like security people at our IT security

1287
01:14:46,890 --> 01:14:56,690
people they have just like to the half

1288
01:14:51,120 --> 01:15:03,180
persons as we say who have to do it all

1289
01:14:56,690 --> 01:15:05,339
it's a huge amount of work they need to

1290
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:08,190
work out a technical solution to

1291
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:12,150
formulate a technical policy what tools

1292
01:15:08,190 --> 01:15:15,000
are to be implemented how life is not

1293
01:15:12,150 --> 01:15:20,660
easy for them either but the only thing

1294
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:23,280
is that when it comes to the operations

1295
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:26,519
everything falls on our shoulders and by

1296
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:28,320
the way our IT security people didn't

1297
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:34,260
deny that so they also had some plans

1298
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:36,938
but they were corrected because we have

1299
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:40,030
big problems with a headcount

1300
01:15:36,939 --> 01:15:42,429
so getting some money for some

1301
01:15:40,030 --> 01:15:45,340
investment project implementing a system

1302
01:15:42,429 --> 01:15:48,159
is more realistic than having more

1303
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:52,349
resources in operations even though we

1304
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:56,159
as new persons still inserting some

1305
01:15:52,349 --> 01:16:02,590
requirements so that the designer should

1306
01:15:56,159 --> 01:16:04,509
calculate the required number and skill

1307
01:16:02,590 --> 01:16:08,739
level of specialty of operations

1308
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:12,429
specialist this parts of projects gets

1309
01:16:08,739 --> 01:16:16,030
ignored completely so it looks like it's

1310
01:16:12,429 --> 01:16:20,050
believed that professionals don't really

1311
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:24,099
have enough work to do so they rely

1312
01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:31,809
completely on them as to inventory of

1313
01:16:24,099 --> 01:16:34,209
the devices it is measured in dozens

1314
01:16:31,809 --> 01:16:35,619
different types of equipment not only

1315
01:16:34,209 --> 01:16:38,349
the number of the same type of equipment

1316
01:16:35,619 --> 01:16:41,228
and it's the same limited set of people

1317
01:16:38,349 --> 01:16:43,840
who need to operate them so what I

1318
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:51,519
encountered personally before the World

1319
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:55,059
Cup on the sites that provided power for

1320
01:16:51,519 --> 01:17:01,389
our sports sites infrastructure sites

1321
01:16:55,059 --> 01:17:03,969
the airport the hotels we put we

1322
01:17:01,389 --> 01:17:06,219
installed additional systems for

1323
01:17:03,969 --> 01:17:08,769
instance encryption systems and the

1324
01:17:06,219 --> 01:17:10,929
project completed just a few days before

1325
01:17:08,769 --> 01:17:13,479
the World Cup by the way this is also a

1326
01:17:10,929 --> 01:17:18,599
separate subject people who are here

1327
01:17:13,479 --> 01:17:24,280
from project organizations contractors I

1328
01:17:18,599 --> 01:17:27,459
can tell them that I see that the

1329
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:32,169
quality of project execution is going

1330
01:17:27,459 --> 01:17:33,820
down so when these systems which have

1331
01:17:32,169 --> 01:17:37,659
not yet been

1332
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:42,250
proofed and verified were passed

1333
01:17:37,659 --> 01:17:44,829
operations so what I saw myself our

1334
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:48,869
specialist would say okay put anything

1335
01:17:44,829 --> 01:17:51,909
there tomorrow if it goes down I'll just

1336
01:17:48,869 --> 01:17:57,820
bypass its and keep working as I had

1337
01:17:51,909 --> 01:18:03,940
before or as they said the requirements

1338
01:17:57,820 --> 01:18:08,429
for you know on a fault removal response

1339
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:15,789
times all this was very strict and

1340
01:18:08,429 --> 01:18:17,469
bonuses were tied these essays directly

1341
01:18:15,789 --> 01:18:19,480
and again there was a separate project

1342
01:18:17,469 --> 01:18:24,150
maybe there would be people here

1343
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:30,518
interest in that like for instance why

1344
01:18:24,150 --> 01:18:32,409
so like a professional was hurt because

1345
01:18:30,519 --> 01:18:35,559
of his earnestness sir because our

1346
01:18:32,409 --> 01:18:37,929
production systems are separated they

1347
01:18:35,559 --> 01:18:42,849
don't have access to the internet well

1348
01:18:37,929 --> 01:18:46,329
there are some interfaces but with the

1349
01:18:42,849 --> 01:18:48,940
enterprise network so but there are no

1350
01:18:46,329 --> 01:18:50,920
interface with the internet what are the

1351
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:58,089
estimated times are quite strict so one

1352
01:18:50,920 --> 01:19:01,449
of the professionals in order to solve

1353
01:18:58,090 --> 01:19:04,960
the problem quickly he installed a

1354
01:19:01,449 --> 01:19:11,348
network card is sold TeamViewer

1355
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:14,260
and got noticed and you know got

1356
01:19:11,349 --> 01:19:17,489
stripped of the bonus so this is just

1357
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:21,280
like an illustration of how these things

1358
01:19:17,489 --> 01:19:22,928
actually happen colleagues anybody to

1359
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:24,639
comment the subject because it's

1360
01:19:22,929 --> 01:19:28,659
actually quite an important subject

1361
01:19:24,639 --> 01:19:34,360
quite often public companies private

1362
01:19:28,659 --> 01:19:37,339
companies would go for the way of you

1363
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:43,790
know investing

1364
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:48,130
in some projects but then not being

1365
01:19:43,790 --> 01:19:48,130
prepared to keep spending on operations

1366
01:19:48,909 --> 01:19:55,940
so with operations people are then

1367
01:19:52,429 --> 01:20:01,880
getting into a situation where they are

1368
01:19:55,940 --> 01:20:04,638
faced with a necessity to work more and

1369
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:07,360
more so vitally maybe you'll share your

1370
01:20:04,639 --> 01:20:11,659
experience in the West our Western

1371
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:14,630
companies Western colleagues so the

1372
01:20:11,659 --> 01:20:16,909
problems are related to the drive for

1373
01:20:14,630 --> 01:20:19,310
cost minimization I'll try

1374
01:20:16,909 --> 01:20:21,348
thank you unfortunately I don't have a

1375
01:20:19,310 --> 01:20:23,570
simple answer I'll start with an answer

1376
01:20:21,349 --> 01:20:29,750
to the previous question I managed to

1377
01:20:23,570 --> 01:20:35,150
work with SCADA engineers IT security

1378
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:37,699
people and the main gripe of the ICS and

1379
01:20:35,150 --> 01:20:40,190
SCADA engineers to information security

1380
01:20:37,699 --> 01:20:43,250
it was like we are earning the money and

1381
01:20:40,190 --> 01:20:45,500
you are spending it and really it's

1382
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:47,510
exact on that whereas their profit

1383
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:50,840
Center and IT security is seen as a

1384
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:54,010
constant and so this gap is about how to

1385
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:56,480
bring across the need for investment in

1386
01:20:54,010 --> 01:20:58,810
most companies done through dashboards

1387
01:20:56,480 --> 01:21:02,750
to the right understanding of the risks

1388
01:20:58,810 --> 01:21:07,510
present for the organization through the

1389
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:10,639
translation of this these risks into

1390
01:21:07,510 --> 01:21:12,560
financial losses in any other losses

1391
01:21:10,639 --> 01:21:17,210
report for this business and showing the

1392
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:19,909
trains our specific steps made on both

1393
01:21:17,210 --> 01:21:23,810
sides of this offense both in IT

1394
01:21:19,909 --> 01:21:26,210
security and in operations security how

1395
01:21:23,810 --> 01:21:27,860
they can minimize the risk in most cases

1396
01:21:26,210 --> 01:21:30,949
these are the company where I worked

1397
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:35,299
gradually again not immediately but

1398
01:21:30,949 --> 01:21:39,830
through this rational presentation of

1399
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:41,739
these risks through the explanation of

1400
01:21:39,830 --> 01:21:46,280
what the

1401
01:21:41,739 --> 01:21:53,058
related to what capex and OPEX they were

1402
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:56,509
involved with it was possible for us to

1403
01:21:53,059 --> 01:22:00,739
get approvals for increasing the

1404
01:21:56,510 --> 01:22:04,429
headcount for taking new employees and

1405
01:22:00,739 --> 01:22:06,888
again it was our case I know many

1406
01:22:04,429 --> 01:22:09,499
companies have their own view of these

1407
01:22:06,889 --> 01:22:11,599
things but the one of the ways is to

1408
01:22:09,499 --> 01:22:14,719
deliver the right way of understanding

1409
01:22:11,599 --> 01:22:17,959
the risk doing it consistently with this

1410
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:23,630
message going to the management with

1411
01:22:17,959 --> 01:22:31,039
these explanations yes we have this

1412
01:22:23,630 --> 01:22:34,459
problem of investment personnel HR other

1413
01:22:31,039 --> 01:22:37,159
costs and nobody who actually wants to

1414
01:22:34,459 --> 01:22:41,420
give us money that is required to make

1415
01:22:37,159 --> 01:22:46,638
this investments so we have to be quite

1416
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:49,610
creative we have to be able to provide

1417
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:53,840
the necessary personnel for maintenance

1418
01:22:49,610 --> 01:23:00,139
and operation and for information

1419
01:22:53,840 --> 01:23:03,199
security and itea and also we need to be

1420
01:23:00,139 --> 01:23:06,320
able to find the operational the money

1421
01:23:03,199 --> 01:23:08,989
to cover the operational operational

1422
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:11,580
costs this is a very creative thing you

1423
01:23:08,989 --> 01:23:16,530
know we're constantly trying to improve

1424
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:20,160
as a plugger I'd like to say well if

1425
01:23:16,530 --> 01:23:22,650
perhaps contractors maintenance

1426
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:26,490
contractors are present here over the

1427
01:23:22,650 --> 01:23:31,530
next month within one month we will post

1428
01:23:26,490 --> 01:23:37,860
a water for our agent an information

1429
01:23:31,530 --> 01:23:41,969
security system in that that we used

1430
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:45,780
here in the World Cup I'd like to add

1431
01:23:41,970 --> 01:23:50,160
that the problem arises so when

1432
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:53,400
information security is not presented in

1433
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:55,590
the right way for the business let me

1434
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:59,129
tell you how it's done in us in our

1435
01:23:55,590 --> 01:24:03,300
company we have operational risk so for

1436
01:23:59,130 --> 01:24:08,190
example something is a broken furnace

1437
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:13,770
and that leads to the holton of attack

1438
01:24:08,190 --> 01:24:18,080
process a satanic explodes and then the

1439
01:24:13,770 --> 01:24:20,340
operational guys plan repairs

1440
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:23,100
replacement and so on so informational

1441
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:25,200
security should follow the same pattern

1442
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:27,300
we have to show that information

1443
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:31,290
security information security is not

1444
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:33,810
just a risk in itself it is a risk that

1445
01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:37,860
can cause collateral damage in other

1446
01:24:33,810 --> 01:24:40,380
spheres so you have to ensure constant

1447
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:45,540
operation security since we're talking

1448
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:48,270
about operational costs please can you

1449
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:50,730
formulate your position is out sort of

1450
01:24:48,270 --> 01:24:53,730
informational security for SCADA is a

1451
01:24:50,730 --> 01:24:58,370
solution to this problem when this

1452
01:24:53,730 --> 01:25:00,870
function quite sensitive to information

1453
01:24:58,370 --> 01:25:02,820
well this function is very sensitive to

1454
01:25:00,870 --> 01:25:07,110
a business or for the business company

1455
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:10,049
that has its own risks is it ok is it

1456
01:25:07,110 --> 01:25:12,490
acceptable to outsource these risks to

1457
01:25:10,050 --> 01:25:16,970
some third parties

1458
01:25:12,490 --> 01:25:19,760
well I believe it is it helps solve the

1459
01:25:16,970 --> 01:25:22,460
problem of a lack of personnel but

1460
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:23,870
unfortunately it doesn't have it doesn't

1461
01:25:22,460 --> 01:25:26,570
solve the problem of a lack of

1462
01:25:23,870 --> 01:25:28,519
operational budget because it requires

1463
01:25:26,570 --> 01:25:30,980
my and no matter what spin you put on it

1464
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:35,380
no matter how you look at it so I

1465
01:25:30,980 --> 01:25:40,370
believe that there are enough companies

1466
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:44,300
to be able to say that perhaps not to

1467
01:25:40,370 --> 01:25:46,519
the fool but the market has taken shape

1468
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:48,350
um and then believe that outsourcing is

1469
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:51,950
a possibility that's why I said that we

1470
01:25:48,350 --> 01:25:54,920
are taking this path thank you thank you

1471
01:25:51,950 --> 01:25:57,559
very much for the question I believe

1472
01:25:54,920 --> 01:26:00,140
that over the past 15 minutes we have

1473
01:25:57,560 --> 01:26:02,810
been talking about the lack of funding

1474
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:07,040
to cover operational costs but if you

1475
01:26:02,810 --> 01:26:10,400
look broader you will see that there is

1476
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:15,140
a crisis of expertise so the problem is

1477
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:18,559
not in money or lack thereof the problem

1478
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:21,080
is a lack of expertise for example if

1479
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:23,800
you are in a small city or in a small

1480
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:27,230
town you don't have enough security

1481
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:30,140
experts so the problem is not so much in

1482
01:26:27,230 --> 01:26:35,660
a lack of funding but in a lack of

1483
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:40,220
skilled personnel skilled professionals

1484
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:44,480
so these two effectors in fact push us

1485
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:46,640
to use the service model model software

1486
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:51,320
well infrastructure as a service and

1487
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:58,420
using infrastructure that is out sourced

1488
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:58,420
so that's what we are now considering do

1489
01:27:00,370 --> 01:27:09,160
I'd like to say that yes outsourcing is

1490
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:14,630
acceptable it is an option in by the way

1491
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:20,650
we buy outsource services but you have

1492
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:24,050
to understand if we're talking about the

1493
01:27:20,650 --> 01:27:27,559
legislation on this security of critical

1494
01:27:24,050 --> 01:27:30,700
infrastructure no matter what fines we

1495
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:34,100
stipulate then there is still the

1496
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:36,769
responsibility for security lies not on

1497
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:42,440
the outsource to provide service

1498
01:27:36,770 --> 01:27:45,290
provider but on the owner themselves and

1499
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:47,540
if something bad happens we will be

1500
01:27:45,290 --> 01:27:55,220
responsible not the outsourced service

1501
01:27:47,540 --> 01:28:02,150
provider yesterday after the end of the

1502
01:27:55,220 --> 01:28:04,990
first day we spent one hour arguing

1503
01:28:02,150 --> 01:28:09,080
about outsource separation centres

1504
01:28:04,990 --> 01:28:15,650
managed from outside I would agree with

1505
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:19,309
all the coins that getting a budget for

1506
01:28:15,650 --> 01:28:23,269
built in some infrastructure or built to

1507
01:28:19,310 --> 01:28:26,140
build a soccer or to install sensors and

1508
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:32,180
start collecting data that's quite

1509
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:34,520
possible that's a doable task but it

1510
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:37,460
depends on the availability of resources

1511
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:41,780
there to avoid available talked about

1512
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:44,450
end processes there is a problem also

1513
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:47,150
the division of areas of responsibility

1514
01:28:44,450 --> 01:28:53,300
the areas of responsibilities boundaries

1515
01:28:47,150 --> 01:28:57,679
between these zones are changing during

1516
01:28:53,300 --> 01:29:00,270
the provision of during the provision of

1517
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:02,910
services the scheme

1518
01:29:00,270 --> 01:29:09,590
incidentally escalation this transition

1519
01:29:02,910 --> 01:29:17,670
the transfer of incidents from socks to

1520
01:29:09,590 --> 01:29:23,610
bottom to a lower level so you never

1521
01:29:17,670 --> 01:29:26,580
know who's going to do this at a lower

1522
01:29:23,610 --> 01:29:30,030
level and there's another problem across

1523
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:32,400
industrial problem many incidents many

1524
01:29:30,030 --> 01:29:39,450
security incidents and problems related

1525
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:54,150
to security incidents are not the same

1526
01:29:39,450 --> 01:29:58,710
as Jesus in other departments if you if

1527
01:29:54,150 --> 01:30:01,349
you tell an Operations engineer that

1528
01:29:58,710 --> 01:30:04,920
you're being that you have been scanned

1529
01:30:01,350 --> 01:30:08,250
for two days he will not be impressed

1530
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:13,620
because he will say back no problems

1531
01:30:08,250 --> 01:30:18,630
my manufacturing is fine it's everything

1532
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:21,330
is working so I believe although there

1533
01:30:18,630 --> 01:30:29,450
are a lot of questions I believe that in

1534
01:30:21,330 --> 01:30:33,800
getting quality MSSP currently is a

1535
01:30:29,450 --> 01:30:35,970
challenge it's big challenge you have to

1536
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:38,640
wait for some time

1537
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:43,490
after wait for the emergence of high

1538
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:43,490
quality services and process schemes

anton curtain ocean we discussed this

1541
01:30:54,900 --> 01:31:03,450
question yesterday

1542
01:30:58,430 --> 01:31:07,710
does the outsourced company need to know

1543
01:31:03,450 --> 01:31:11,130
the tech processor okay and okay does it

1544
01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:13,440
need to know what happens Oh does it

1545
01:31:11,130 --> 01:31:16,530
need to know that the answers company

1546
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:18,719
know everything and the if it doesn't

1547
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:22,650
know would it be able to perform its

1548
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:27,390
duties and functions normally you mean

1549
01:31:22,650 --> 01:31:30,960
outsourcing of what no we're not talking

1550
01:31:27,390 --> 01:31:33,810
about Sox we discuss outsourcing as a

1551
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:41,240
functional source can be for anything

1552
01:31:33,810 --> 01:31:41,240
for operation for monitoring outsourcing

1553
01:31:41,270 --> 01:31:48,570
has its rightful place also even if

1554
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:49,830
there is a deficit of resources but on

1555
01:31:48,570 --> 01:31:54,719
the other hand it's clear that

1556
01:31:49,830 --> 01:31:57,240
outsourcing is a business and and the

1557
01:31:54,720 --> 01:32:02,390
business businesses are only interested

1558
01:31:57,240 --> 01:32:07,920
in today's dates of payment and data

1559
01:32:02,390 --> 01:32:09,630
that services have to be performed there

1560
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:13,470
will be problems problems related to

1561
01:32:09,630 --> 01:32:17,640
interactions problems related to how

1562
01:32:13,470 --> 01:32:20,570
this company is perceived from outside

1563
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:25,500
of so of course scatter people need a

1564
01:32:20,570 --> 01:32:29,420
strong service providing information

1565
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:33,660
security and

1566

managing all the conflicts colleagues I

1567
01:32:33,660 --> 01:32:38,260
suggest that we

01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:42,769
[Music]

1569
01:32:38,260 --> 01:32:49,060
followed a fallen format I suggest that

1570
01:32:42,770 --> 01:32:53,420
we finish up and formulate our questions

1571
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:55,250
we have started discussing resources but

1572
01:32:53,420 --> 01:32:58,489
everything that many companies now are

1573
01:32:55,250 --> 01:33:02,210
facing a different problem but before

1574
01:32:58,489 --> 01:33:03,769
people complained that we can do this

1575
01:33:02,210 --> 01:33:08,989
and that because we don't have the

1576
01:33:03,770 --> 01:33:10,940
people we don't have the money but now

1577
01:33:08,989 --> 01:33:18,739
there are situations when you have the

1578
01:33:10,940 --> 01:33:25,119
money you have the resources but but no

1579
01:33:18,739 --> 01:33:30,980
results are produced and we can face

1580
01:33:25,119 --> 01:33:33,049
some systemic problems such as such as a

1581
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:36,500
lack of skilled Precision's not only in

1582
01:33:33,050 --> 01:33:39,530
the regions I can tell you quite frankly

1583
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:41,480
that even in large cities we face a

1584
01:33:39,530 --> 01:33:47,980
significant problem we are ready to

1585
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:47,980
teach people are ready - we are ready to

1586
01:33:48,670 --> 01:33:55,699
train people but the quality but the

1587
01:33:52,969 --> 01:33:59,020
quality of people is so low or perhaps

1588
01:33:55,699 --> 01:34:01,030
their expectations are so high that

1589
01:33:59,020 --> 01:34:04,310
[Music]

1590
01:34:01,030 --> 01:34:07,190
there is a mismatch between our

1591
01:34:04,310 --> 01:34:09,020
expectations and what we can get in the

1592
01:34:07,190 --> 01:34:13,638
market there's a huge problem in the

1593
01:34:09,020 --> 01:34:18,170
market - level of competences of vendors

1594
01:34:13,639 --> 01:34:21,610
integrators and partners sometimes is at

1595
01:34:18,170 --> 01:34:21,610
a low point and

1596
01:34:21,639 --> 01:34:32,659
indeed them this topic is quite special

1597
01:34:29,860 --> 01:34:34,940
even in the real skinny girl with a

1598
01:34:32,659 --> 01:34:39,469
large discussion whether we need to

1599
01:34:34,940 --> 01:34:44,209
identify a separate function information

1600
01:34:39,469 --> 01:34:48,860
security of SCADA or does it need be

1601
01:34:44,209 --> 01:34:54,889
part of project activities and operation

1602
01:34:48,860 --> 01:34:58,098
and we were able to convince leaders

1603
01:34:54,889 --> 01:35:01,550
that this is a very specific topic that

1604
01:34:58,099 --> 01:35:05,030
means separate attention so this is an

1605
01:35:01,550 --> 01:35:06,949
IG one of the IT systems so the

1606
01:35:05,030 --> 01:35:15,499
specifics of business and business

1607
01:35:06,949 --> 01:35:19,848
processes that that there's a separate

1608
01:35:15,499 --> 01:35:24,110
branch of reporting to the engineer -

1609
01:35:19,849 --> 01:35:29,110
director - the director at this allowed

1610
01:35:24,110 --> 01:35:32,929
us to it's allowed us to be able to

1611
01:35:29,110 --> 01:35:38,209
explain to our leaders that the security

1612
01:35:32,929 --> 01:35:41,840
of a SCADA is as separate a very

1613
01:35:38,209 --> 01:35:44,920
separate and very important area with

1614
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:48,019
that I want to give the microphone to

1615
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:52,699
whoever wants to ask a question or

1616
01:35:48,019 --> 01:35:54,889
perhaps offer a comment and then give

1617
01:35:52,699 --> 01:35:56,719
the audience to ask a question Thank You

1618

Andrei I'd like to comment on the

1619
01:35:56,719 --> 01:36:02,209
situation related to cybersecurity so

1620
01:36:00,469 --> 01:36:07,599
this area like our Fronteras security

1621
01:36:02,209 --> 01:36:13,039
specialist specialists 2 to 5 million

1622
01:36:07,599 --> 01:36:18,769
specialists you know the world is sort 2

1623
01:36:13,039 --> 01:36:20,209
to 5 2 to 5 million experts short when

1624
01:36:18,769 --> 01:36:22,250
it comes to information security and

1625
01:36:20,209 --> 01:36:26,830
look at this panel

1626
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:30,700
most of them are men why is it such a

1627
01:36:26,830 --> 01:36:34,400
male thing but okay we have 10%

1628
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:44,650
exceptional people are females and women

1629
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:48,290
I remember I remember there was a great

1630
01:36:44,650 --> 01:36:51,920
employee originally a musician by

1631
01:36:48,290 --> 01:36:56,740
training but she was able to to be a

1632
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:59,390
great worker so I believe that women

1633
01:36:56,740 --> 01:37:02,360
great and please do not underestimate

1634
01:36:59,390 --> 01:37:05,290
yourself we welcome you very much to

1635
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:05,290
this business

1636
01:37:43,130 --> 01:37:52,160
while we were discussing the question of

1637
01:37:49,130 --> 01:37:55,510
what illusionism or Marxism is correct

1638
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:59,059
one not talking about the need for

1639
01:37:55,510 --> 01:38:06,970
outsource to fix the problem of a lack

1640
01:37:59,060 --> 01:38:06,970
off of a lack of qualified professionals

1641
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:17,210
so perhaps I am

1642
01:38:12,010 --> 01:38:20,180
perhaps if this girl that you mentioned

1643
01:38:17,210 --> 01:38:22,610
a musician by training and if she

1644
01:38:20,180 --> 01:38:26,690
originally was trained as an information

1645
01:38:22,610 --> 01:38:29,690
security expert perhaps you would be an

1646
01:38:26,690 --> 01:38:32,450
even better information security expert

1647
01:38:29,690 --> 01:38:34,969
and she is now I believe we have a

1648
01:38:32,450 --> 01:38:38,290
larger problem inability to form long

1649
01:38:34,970 --> 01:38:44,230
and large long term and large teams

1650
01:38:38,290 --> 01:38:48,220
these teams are always changing a

1651
01:38:44,230 --> 01:38:52,129
professional NATO is something in

1652
01:38:48,220 --> 01:38:55,700
metallurgy then in power generation and

1653
01:38:52,130 --> 01:38:59,470
then in a completely different place for

1654
01:38:55,700 --> 01:39:03,320
example in a ministry we're discussing

1655
01:38:59,470 --> 01:39:08,630
scatter scatter systems but these are

1656
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:11,030
three component systems so when are you

1657
01:39:08,630 --> 01:39:13,360
going to what are you going to do it's

1658
01:39:11,030 --> 01:39:15,009
going to because at the lower level

1659
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:17,710
there

1660
01:39:15,010 --> 01:39:21,700
only harms calluses not only control

1661
01:39:17,710 --> 01:39:27,989
results but at the lower level people

1662
01:39:21,700 --> 01:39:35,260
are talking about intelligent sensors

1663
01:39:27,989 --> 01:39:38,589
compute capabilities for edge computing

1664
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:40,420
devices how are you going to ensure

1665
01:39:38,590 --> 01:39:46,890
information security

1666
01:39:40,420 --> 01:39:46,890
if this equipment is being dis improving

1667
01:39:48,630 --> 01:39:55,720
the suburban by the way is becoming a

1668
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:59,890
tech company there are very many

1669
01:39:55,720 --> 01:40:02,350
explanations why this exception they are

1670
01:39:59,890 --> 01:40:05,200
buying electron microscopes that they

1671
01:40:02,350 --> 01:40:07,510
are starting to reverse engineer

1672
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:10,239
computer chips so they have funda stood

1673
01:40:07,510 --> 01:40:15,970
perhaps that they will perhaps have to

1674
01:40:10,239 --> 01:40:18,339
build their own processors to build

1675
01:40:15,970 --> 01:40:21,700
their own financial empire so nothing

1676
01:40:18,340 --> 01:40:23,650
has been said about this we're talking

1677
01:40:21,700 --> 01:40:29,320
about papers were talking about

1678
01:40:23,650 --> 01:40:31,769
complaints we understand us complaints

1679
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:39,070
and real process processes are in

1680
01:40:31,770 --> 01:40:41,530
inseparable but paper documents are just

1681
01:40:39,070 --> 01:40:43,860
proof that something has been physically

1682
01:40:41,530 --> 01:40:43,860
done

1683
01:40:45,070 --> 01:40:54,019
but very often we have documents but

1684
01:40:49,610 --> 01:40:56,420
nothing has physical agenda how are you

1685
01:40:54,020 --> 01:40:58,670
what's your question how are you going

1686
01:40:56,420 --> 01:41:02,750
to solve the problem of off against

1687
01:40:58,670 --> 01:41:05,389
three how are you going to solve the

1688
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:09,429
three-tier problem of Scudder

1689
01:41:05,389 --> 01:41:13,639
what a cry can can shut down

1690
01:41:09,429 --> 01:41:15,829
yes cotta easily what are you going to

1691
01:41:13,639 --> 01:41:18,380
do if you're going to use a turbine that

1692
01:41:15,829 --> 01:41:23,570
is not manifested in Russia so what are

1693
01:41:18,380 --> 01:41:26,540
you thoughts about this thank you your

1694
01:41:23,570 --> 01:41:30,530
question was a kind of a comment a

1695
01:41:26,540 --> 01:41:35,960
visionary comment perhaps yes we can

1696
01:41:30,530 --> 01:41:38,469
talk about a future state ok I'm talking

1697
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:42,770
about real time there are intelligent

1698
01:41:38,469 --> 01:41:46,460
sensors that already have security

1699
01:41:42,770 --> 01:41:48,380
embedded in them this is not done for

1700
01:41:46,460 --> 01:41:53,090
all products for also answers but for

1701
01:41:48,380 --> 01:41:55,730
some select latest sensors and we can

1702
01:41:53,090 --> 01:41:58,520
implement different policies security

1703
01:41:55,730 --> 01:42:01,190
policies in zone for example for example

1704
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:03,139
we can run only the code that we

1705
01:42:01,190 --> 01:42:09,678
understand robot so the policy and

1706
01:42:03,139 --> 01:42:12,440
whatever is not allowed is prohibited we

1707
01:42:09,679 --> 01:42:18,050
form requirements for each of the system

1708
01:42:12,440 --> 01:42:22,159
components and then we kind of adjust

1709
01:42:18,050 --> 01:42:26,570
our technology to suit this to fit the

1710
01:42:22,159 --> 01:42:27,190
standards maybe cryptography or anything

1711
01:42:26,570 --> 01:42:31,880
else

1712
01:42:27,190 --> 01:42:36,199
yes but you're saying that night in many

1713
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:38,360
industries there is a high shear there

1714
01:42:36,199 --> 01:42:42,080
is a very significant share

1715
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:46,940
foreign vendors these inventors formed a

1716
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:48,679
certain product offer outside of our

1717
01:42:46,940 --> 01:42:52,940
country and then don't bring their

1718
01:42:48,679 --> 01:42:58,040
equipment to here so the question is one

1719
01:42:52,940 --> 01:43:00,469
of formative right requirements so so we

1720
01:42:58,040 --> 01:43:03,350
need to need something and the

1721
01:43:00,469 --> 01:43:08,659
disciplines need to be in a position to

1722
01:43:03,350 --> 01:43:12,110
provide it what we like you of course we

1723
01:43:08,659 --> 01:43:18,080
need to develop a Russian national

1724
01:43:12,110 --> 01:43:20,030
electronic component base ECB when I

1725
01:43:18,080 --> 01:43:23,780
asked you how you're going to ensure

1726
01:43:20,030 --> 01:43:28,699
your security I wasn't sure what this

1727
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:29,630
question who this question was for for

1728
01:43:28,699 --> 01:43:35,178
everybody okay

1729
01:43:29,630 --> 01:43:40,460
speaking about edge industrial Internet

1730
01:43:35,179 --> 01:43:42,500
of Things digitization these kind of

1731
01:43:40,460 --> 01:43:45,369
things we have to be clear whose

1732
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:47,630
security we provide let me explain

1733
01:43:45,369 --> 01:43:52,040
before talking about is your

1734
01:43:47,630 --> 01:43:58,250
digitization trend can we have three

1735
01:43:52,040 --> 01:44:03,139
players I have customers that use these

1736
01:43:58,250 --> 01:44:06,260
smart devices and we have to make sure

1737
01:44:03,139 --> 01:44:09,800
that they are secure these customers

1738
01:44:06,260 --> 01:44:12,610
there are many factors of smart devices

1739
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:16,420
and applications that have to be able to

1740
01:44:12,610 --> 01:44:23,480
protect their devices and the third

1741
01:44:16,420 --> 01:44:25,190
player is the service provider service

1742
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:27,409
providers that provide services through

1743
01:44:25,190 --> 01:44:31,009
these devices or applications so they

1744
01:44:27,409 --> 01:44:33,619
approach to security of these three

1745
01:44:31,010 --> 01:44:37,500
entities three large players in these

1746
01:44:33,619 --> 01:44:42,839
new topics he is

1747
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:49,050
is for the provider developer and the

1748
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:55,910
customer so speaking about some recipe

1749
01:44:49,050 --> 01:44:55,910
or some framework or standard is around

1750
01:44:56,930 --> 01:45:05,880
nevertheless producers of new protection

1751
01:45:03,170 --> 01:45:13,560
technologies smart sensors and so on

1752
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:17,510
this spend a lot of money into what we

1753
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:17,510
call commercial non-commercial

1754
01:45:17,570 --> 01:45:30,090
consortium

1755
01:45:18,750 --> 01:45:33,300
there's the IOT consortium colleagues I

1756
01:45:30,090 --> 01:45:36,920
believe that we have other people who

1757
01:45:33,300 --> 01:45:42,750
are interested in other questions I

1758
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:45,390
wouldn't tell you the news that Karen I

1759
01:45:42,750 --> 01:45:49,140
as a moderator finished my search will

1760
01:45:45,390 --> 01:45:53,190
you allow me yes we live not in the

1761
01:45:49,140 --> 01:45:57,020
ideal world and even if we spend two

1762
01:45:53,190 --> 01:46:03,269
hours discussing schedule we cannot

1763
01:45:57,020 --> 01:46:07,590
cover everything we omitted Internet of

1764
01:46:03,270 --> 01:46:12,960
Things for example many other areas we

1765
01:46:07,590 --> 01:46:16,020
didn't discuss data leaks that SCADA

1766
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:19,700
generates we didn't discuss important

1767
01:46:16,020 --> 01:46:22,110
replacements we didn't discuss our

1768
01:46:19,700 --> 01:46:24,570
dependence on foreign manufacturers

1769
01:46:22,110 --> 01:46:27,210
there is a whole range of problems and

1770
01:46:24,570 --> 01:46:30,780
limitations innovation we don't live in

1771
01:46:27,210 --> 01:46:33,030
the ideal world and we'll live we are

1772
01:46:30,780 --> 01:46:35,009
subject to limitations that are

1773
01:46:33,030 --> 01:46:39,210
objective and we can't do anything about

1774
01:46:35,010 --> 01:46:41,220
them I mean we those who are involved in

1775
01:46:39,210 --> 01:46:44,060
ensuring information security of SCADA

1776
01:46:41,220 --> 01:46:49,519
we cannot design in your company just

1777
01:46:44,060 --> 01:46:52,349
like info or any other but

1778
01:46:49,519 --> 01:46:57,229
we have to adapt we have to do whatever

1779
01:46:52,349 --> 01:46:57,229
we can to make things better

1780
01:47:01,639 --> 01:47:07,609
if you speak please take a microphone

1781
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:15,800
when it comes to the unit of things that

1782
01:47:10,439 --> 01:47:22,469
if we have four standards of from laura1

1783
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:26,129
to the standard @rv see Russian venture

1784
01:47:22,469 --> 01:47:31,919
company is creating based on some

1785
01:47:26,129 --> 01:47:39,809
foreign foreign standard so again we

1786
01:47:31,919 --> 01:47:42,809
have sub optimal use of funds so why do

1787
01:47:39,809 --> 01:47:46,469
we need for standards if we are so poor

1788
01:47:42,809 --> 01:47:48,059
if we okay we are not poor in terms of

1789
01:47:46,469 --> 01:47:52,439
money but we're poor in terms of human

1790
01:47:48,059 --> 01:47:57,079
resources so we haven't discussed okay

1791
01:47:52,439 --> 01:48:01,409
the theory discussion theory is good but

1792
01:47:57,079 --> 01:48:03,389
okay you suggested that we are wasting

1793
01:48:01,409 --> 01:48:08,329
money oh no in fact we're not wasting

1794
01:48:03,389 --> 01:48:11,999
money we are we are consolidating two

1795
01:48:08,329 --> 01:48:14,820
non-commercial organizations non profit

1796
01:48:11,999 --> 01:48:19,499
organizations they have joined their

1797
01:48:14,820 --> 01:48:22,139
forces they have established common

1798
01:48:19,499 --> 01:48:24,269
approaches to data frameworks to data

1799
01:48:22,139 --> 01:48:26,429
leaks and minimum service security

1800
01:48:24,269 --> 01:48:32,300
requirements yes and these requirements

1801
01:48:26,429 --> 01:48:35,429
are international so I am proposing I

1802
01:48:32,300 --> 01:48:37,589
say that in fact it's quite the contrary

1803
01:48:35,429 --> 01:48:39,419
there is consolidation that's going on

1804
01:48:37,589 --> 01:48:42,329
in the world so we have to be part of

1805
01:48:39,419 --> 01:48:44,909
this large-scale global work and what

1806
01:48:42,329 --> 01:48:47,459
are we doing for this and or rather what

1807
01:48:44,909 --> 01:48:49,739
we're ready to do for this so I believe

1808
01:48:47,459 --> 01:48:52,829
we at positive technology Zoroaster from

1809
01:48:49,739 --> 01:48:55,739
solar we are try to we're trying to work

1810
01:48:52,829 --> 01:48:57,929
with this foreign consortium structures

1811
01:48:55,739 --> 01:48:59,320
in order to bring our expertise into

1812
01:48:57,929 --> 01:49:02,190
this into

1813
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:06,429
get enriched through their expertise

1814
01:49:02,190 --> 01:49:10,059
chorus or have ten minutes to go please

1815
01:49:06,430 --> 01:49:15,610
before you ask questions identify use of

1816
01:49:10,060 --> 01:49:19,560
Alexi corruption cut we can gather a

1817
01:49:15,610 --> 01:49:24,160
separate conference about this topic I

1818
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:26,770
wanted to ask you about import

1819
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:29,230
replacement have you ever faced any

1820
01:49:26,770 --> 01:49:31,840
problems perhaps you have seen some

1821
01:49:29,230 --> 01:49:36,160
trends because in our company it's very

1822
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:42,520
relevant I'd like to answer this right

1823
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:44,530
away yes we have faced problems related

1824
01:49:42,520 --> 01:49:46,720
to import replacement price in some

1825
01:49:44,530 --> 01:49:49,269
cases it's more less successful and

1826
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:52,870
other cases less successful import

1827
01:49:49,270 --> 01:49:55,120
replacements do work some of our clients

1828
01:49:52,870 --> 01:49:58,360
have entire programs for import

1829
01:49:55,120 --> 01:50:02,559
replacement in industrial networks and

1830
01:49:58,360 --> 01:50:11,860
industrial moves and you know success

1831
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:14,680
rates are different well I'll say from

1832
01:50:11,860 --> 01:50:16,929
my experience for imposed substitutions

1833
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:19,080
of course the pace of change is

1834
01:50:16,930 --> 01:50:23,350
different different directions as to

1835
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:27,280
information security I think it's not

1836
01:50:23,350 --> 01:50:30,040
too bad our local manufacturers

1837
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:33,700
producers may be lagging behind

1838
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:41,940
somewhere but only halt at the world

1839
01:50:33,700 --> 01:50:44,800
level as to ICS security than the

1840
01:50:41,940 --> 01:50:48,540
service life of such system is longer

1841
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:51,760
than in IT security and I did 90 percent

1842
01:50:48,540 --> 01:50:55,660
industrial control systems are imported

1843
01:50:51,760 --> 01:51:03,790
so here without some special targeted

1844
01:50:55,660 --> 01:51:08,019
support program from the government we

1845
01:51:03,790 --> 01:51:10,360
won't be able to proceed the progress on

1846
01:51:08,020 --> 01:51:13,990
my behalf I'd like to say that any

1847
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:18,009
criticism towards Russian vendors

1848
01:51:13,990 --> 01:51:23,670
integrators and partners fully applies

1849
01:51:18,010 --> 01:51:28,810
to the producers of ICS and SCADA

1850
01:51:23,670 --> 01:51:33,490
components so we are not satisfied with

1851
01:51:28,810 --> 01:51:36,040
the response at our request maybe I have

1852
01:51:33,490 --> 01:51:40,420
a biased point of view but from our

1853
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:43,480
experience this feedback cannot satisfy

1854
01:51:40,420 --> 01:51:48,760
either in terms of quality or speed of

1855
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:52,799
response your question are due to cover

1856
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:55,030
info substitutions substitution of what

1857
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:58,800
industrial control systems got

1858
01:51:55,030 --> 01:51:58,800
information security

1859
01:51:59,780 --> 01:52:02,920
[Music]

1860
01:52:15,989 --> 01:52:20,888
unfortunately the response can't be

1861
01:52:18,280 --> 01:52:24,090
translated because the speaker is not

1862
01:52:20,889 --> 01:52:24,090
using the microphone

1863
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:54,239
so the question was whether you had

1864
01:52:52,350 --> 01:52:57,090
experienced with the inspo substitution

1865
01:52:54,239 --> 01:53:00,959
health organizers so with a hint towards

1866
01:52:57,090 --> 01:53:04,710
gas prone EFT in arms next to the

1867
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:09,800
foundry as a Technopark where for three

1868
01:53:04,710 --> 01:53:14,460
years now proposals from Russian

1869
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:17,310
companies have been examined now from

1870
01:53:14,460 --> 01:53:19,800
SCADA developers to industrial control

1871
01:53:17,310 --> 01:53:23,310
system development also in the same

1872
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:26,699
technopark the compatibility of security

1873
01:53:23,310 --> 01:53:32,250
systems in Russian markets was started

1874
01:53:26,699 --> 01:53:34,678
to the industrial control systems so

1875
01:53:32,250 --> 01:53:36,719
this is some experience but every

1876
01:53:34,679 --> 01:53:39,570
industry has a self specificity not

1877
01:53:36,719 --> 01:53:44,130
everybody has resources to organize the

1878
01:53:39,570 --> 01:53:46,980
work in such a way the other question is

1879
01:53:44,130 --> 01:53:50,190
whether this import substitution thing

1880
01:53:46,980 --> 01:53:54,120
is for the long term and in a serious

1881
01:53:50,190 --> 01:53:56,790
way here to stay or people can take some

1882
01:53:54,120 --> 01:53:59,969
time and then expect that this subject

1883
01:53:56,790 --> 01:54:02,820
will go away now talking about embedded

1884
01:53:59,969 --> 01:54:05,160
security I think there's a big gap three

1885
01:54:02,820 --> 01:54:07,099
or four years perhaps between a Russian

1886
01:54:05,160 --> 01:54:10,559
the vendors and global vendors wine

1887
01:54:07,100 --> 01:54:14,960
because in my opinion they don't

1888
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:18,540
perceive cyber security as their own

1889
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:21,050
stop ik they don't see it as an integral

1890
01:54:18,540 --> 01:54:25,679
parts of their business we talk about

1891
01:54:21,050 --> 01:54:29,010
Russian SCADA and the industrial

1892
01:54:25,679 --> 01:54:37,699
controls sisters vendors sensors they

1893
01:54:29,010 --> 01:54:37,699
don't have this outlook so in if you

1894
01:54:38,810 --> 01:54:50,580
if outside vendors will come back with

1895
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:52,739
this you'll have to learn them but so I

1896
01:54:50,580 --> 01:54:54,809
know the situation but I don't think

1897
01:54:52,739 --> 01:54:58,320
it'll be proper for me to make comments

1898
01:54:54,810 --> 01:55:02,280
on their behalf my little comment is

1899
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:04,920
that my person know take on the info

1900
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:07,590
substitution is that there's a lot of

1901
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:11,969
hidden agendas there so this object

1902
01:55:07,590 --> 01:55:15,570
there the whole subjects I was raised in

1903
01:55:11,969 --> 01:55:18,900
2014 after the incorporation of the

1904
01:55:15,570 --> 01:55:23,599
Crimea when a threat was felt that our

1905
01:55:18,900 --> 01:55:27,780
Western partners would ban selling some

1906
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:31,800
equipment or systems here so at that

1907
01:55:27,780 --> 01:55:33,630
time a lot of cases where they would

1908
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:35,719
bring us something some equipment for

1909
01:55:33,630 --> 01:55:38,489
testing different classes

1910
01:55:35,719 --> 01:55:40,820
telecommunications dates a collection

1911
01:55:38,489 --> 01:55:45,989
equipment where they were just at take

1912
01:55:40,820 --> 01:55:49,940
imported equipment of you know old

1913
01:55:45,989 --> 01:55:53,099
versions and just put new labels on them

1914
01:55:49,940 --> 01:55:55,980
unfortunately of course this approach is

1915
01:55:53,100 --> 01:56:00,300
not acceptable on the other hand because

1916
01:55:55,980 --> 01:56:03,120
such threats did not materialize now the

1917
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:06,930
situation has calmed down a bit and the

1918
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:09,599
way I see it this whole hype about

1919
01:56:06,930 --> 01:56:13,590
import substitution has gone down in

1920
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:16,370
though in Ross city a Russian grid the

1921
01:56:13,590 --> 01:56:19,560
import substitution program was adopted

1922
01:56:16,370 --> 01:56:25,530
with a working group organized I think

1923
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:27,930
they need to show the outcomes in 2023

1924
01:56:25,530 --> 01:56:31,170
but for me as an Operations person I

1925
01:56:27,930 --> 01:56:35,130
would rather operate Cisco equipment

1926
01:56:31,170 --> 01:56:37,699
then some little animal with a Russian

1927
01:56:35,130 --> 01:56:40,730
badge on it

1928
01:56:37,699 --> 01:56:41,178
I will remind about the arms container

1929
01:56:40,730 --> 01:56:46,629
box

1930
01:56:41,179 --> 01:56:49,429
we as a vendor for the industrial sector

1931
01:56:46,630 --> 01:56:52,690
we have tested our equipment in this

1932
01:56:49,429 --> 01:56:55,370
Technic parts for the interoperability

1933
01:56:52,690 --> 01:56:59,599
with the automation platforms from

1934
01:56:55,370 --> 01:57:04,090
several Western vendors and the result

1935
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:09,560
of this testing was such that this

1936
01:57:04,090 --> 01:57:13,130
interoperability was confirmed and the

1937
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:15,410
capability of this equipment for being

1938
01:57:13,130 --> 01:57:17,929
used in such with such automation

1939
01:57:15,410 --> 01:57:20,630
platforms was confirmed as well

1940
01:57:17,929 --> 01:57:23,530
when colleagues we've only got last two

1941
01:57:20,630 --> 01:57:26,860
minutes so please ask your last question

1942
01:57:23,530 --> 01:57:34,670
I wanted to ask a question about Cisco

1943
01:57:26,860 --> 01:57:36,460
and si as and Vice President Biden did

1944
01:57:34,670 --> 01:57:39,520
not hesitate to say they have back doors

1945
01:57:36,460 --> 01:57:42,710
cisco parallels and others so the key

1946
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:47,210
substitution problem problem is that a

1947
01:57:42,710 --> 01:57:50,120
Russian has no manufacturing of industry

1948
01:57:47,210 --> 01:57:55,449
standards network equipment of those

1949
01:57:50,120 --> 01:57:58,790
people who forget to translate Chinese

1950
01:57:55,449 --> 01:58:03,320
manuals are not really an example of

1951
01:57:58,790 --> 01:58:05,630
that but Cisco firewall is widely known

1952
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:09,769
as a big hole in your signature system

1953
01:58:05,630 --> 01:58:16,610
how can I comment that and ways to

1954
01:58:09,770 --> 01:58:19,429
overcome this well here in a situation

1955
01:58:16,610 --> 01:58:21,980
of a dilemma on the one hand for me as

1956
01:58:19,429 --> 01:58:24,010
an Operations person it is easier to

1957
01:58:21,980 --> 01:58:29,419
work with the equipment that a I know

1958
01:58:24,010 --> 01:58:31,760
that I've got some spares in stock my

1959
01:58:29,420 --> 01:58:33,679
people are trained but on the other hand

1960
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:35,540
as a patriot and as a person

1961
01:58:33,679 --> 01:58:41,410
understanding the threats of information

1962
01:58:35,540 --> 01:58:41,410
security I well in this case I'm sorry I

1963
01:58:41,630 --> 01:58:48,020
I need to take this position so like for

1964
01:58:46,130 --> 01:58:51,200
the information security people I'm like

1965
01:58:48,020 --> 01:58:54,140
a peasant you tell me what I need to do

1966
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:56,690
I'll be happy to hear well we're

1967
01:58:54,140 --> 01:58:59,330
prepared to consider

1968
01:58:56,690 --> 01:59:01,639
we don't even ask you to make it better

1969
01:58:59,330 --> 01:59:03,920
please try not to make it worse

1970
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:07,340
so we've already tried some services

1971
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:09,230
equipment in different areas and I agree

1972
01:59:07,340 --> 01:59:15,260
with you there's a wish

1973
01:59:09,230 --> 01:59:18,620
but again we can't just rush and go for

1974
01:59:15,260 --> 01:59:22,510
import substitution knowing that nobody

1975
01:59:18,620 --> 01:59:27,410
will relieve us of the responsibility

1976
01:59:22,510 --> 01:59:35,960
for the faultless operation of our

1977
01:59:27,410 --> 01:59:41,590
systems yes indeed our firewalls are

1978
01:59:35,960 --> 01:59:45,590
built on us but they're the same so any

1979
01:59:41,590 --> 01:59:54,650
anybody has any good idea you'll be

1980
01:59:45,590 --> 01:59:56,390
welcome well I well a gas problem is not

1981
01:59:54,650 --> 01:59:58,940
sitting on tea calm but they purchased

1982
01:59:56,390 --> 02:00:01,520
this required this program chicken that

1983
01:59:58,940 --> 02:00:05,740
had quite a good project you can do like

1984
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:08,810
as well Bank start based on your needs

1985
02:00:05,740 --> 02:00:13,660
because what Cisco provides it can be

1986
02:00:08,810 --> 02:00:18,080
used in power grids in different

1987
02:00:13,660 --> 02:00:19,910
industries but why not build something

1988
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:23,600
for yourself I think it's become quite

1989
02:00:19,910 --> 02:00:29,030
obvious that Ministry of Industry is not

1990
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:31,160
going to save you so if you needs to

1991
02:00:29,030 --> 02:00:33,889
protect yourselves from such threats you

1992
02:00:31,160 --> 02:00:36,200
need to start taking responsibility for

1993
02:00:33,890 --> 02:00:38,690
the production of such equipment yes I

1994
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:42,590
understand it's an absolute dead-end

1995
02:00:38,690 --> 02:00:45,589
not even the largest company will cope

1996
02:00:42,590 --> 02:00:48,020
over this it's an absolute blind alley

1997
02:00:45,590 --> 02:00:50,960
metallurgist should be producing metal

1998
02:00:48,020 --> 02:00:53,260
and automation two producers should

1999
02:00:50,960 --> 02:00:56,349
produce automation tools we have no

2000
02:00:53,260 --> 02:00:59,650
scenario I think it's obvious for many

2001
02:00:56,349 --> 02:01:02,590
people and now that we passed the

2002
02:00:59,650 --> 02:01:06,129
deadline I would like to thank all the

2003
02:01:02,590 --> 02:01:09,639
participants in this exciting discussion

2004
02:01:06,130 --> 02:01:15,250
I've been delighted to exchange opinions

2005
02:01:09,639 --> 02:01:18,610
with you to compare notes to understand

2006
02:01:15,250 --> 02:01:22,599
how fast all of us are going to bethe

2007
02:01:18,610 --> 02:01:26,549
life to hear your expertise and I'm

2008
02:01:22,599 --> 02:01:26,550
hoping that we'll meet again thank you
