Yugi has an Achilles tear include a

catastrophe iniquitous to support blue

DNA g20 Doretta shirt usually not enough

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:13,650
professionals they are hard to keep the

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:15,149
is a lot of turn they don't want to stay

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,949
in one company I want to move on to

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,550
better places and source of it but on

8
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:28,380
the other hand you on the way to this

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:31,289
room you have you've probably found it

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:38,399
hard to push through the crowd of IT

11
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:40,230
professionals gathered here so we have

12
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,050
kind of a contradiction here on the one

13
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:45,269
hand we don't have enough professionals

14
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:49,230
on the other hand there are more

15
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,910
professionals out there and these there

16
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,788
are more and more companies out there in

17
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:58,140
the market they need to be more secure

18
00:00:53,789 --> 00:01:00,960
in terms of IT and the regulator's force

19
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,570
the companies to take their IT security

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,610
more seriously they introduce impose

21
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,040
more rules and regulations that must be

22
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,200
complied with and that's a lot of

23
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,600
headache that needs to be taken care

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,259
reform what does that require that

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:20,658
requires IT specialists so we need to do

26
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:24,060
something about this IT specialist

27
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:28,070
deficit to talk about this topic I have

28
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:35,840
gathered some guests here and I would I

29
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:40,229
would like to I'd like to get rid of the

30
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:43,920
barrier between the audience and the

31
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:46,380
panel I'd like us to get closer

32
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,880
I'd like this conversation be as

33
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:53,310
interactive as possible before I

34
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,839
introduce to you the speakers and the

35
00:01:53,310 --> 00:02:03,520
panelists let's

36
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:07,030
a round of introductions some of you are

37
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,280
probably professionally involved a

38
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:13,000
professionally working IT security raise

39
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,790
your hand if you do okay great

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,819
perhaps there are representatives of

41
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:23,010
vendor companies here perhaps raise your

42
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:29,440
hand if if if you are from vendors or

43
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:33,160
the only one here other people that

44
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:37,390
represent the customer Edwards the

45
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,079
companies that do security for

46
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,798
themselves

47
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:49,540
all right we have live and couple more

48
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:51,970
folks and we have some unidentified

49
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:55,298
people here but we'll okay we'll figure

50
00:02:51,970 --> 00:03:02,380
you out as we go along based on your

51
00:02:55,299 --> 00:03:05,140
questions we will be talking about how

52
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:08,079
to attract the right talent into the

53
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:12,880
industry I haven't I've invited live

54
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:18,420
ponine of IT security department of so

55
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:21,608
yes Mauricio Ava of the Rostelecom solar

56
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,980
company she does HR there and here echo

57
00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:25,030

58
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,030
[Music]

59
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:41,510
rediff head of department youth affairs

60
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:44,540
department and vitelli Malkin of the IT

61
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:47,980
security department of another company

62
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:50,450
so we have 12 representative crowds here

63
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:56,359
the first question if I may

64
00:03:50,450 --> 00:04:03,010
I'd like to ask of Leo Leo do you agree

65
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:05,540
that there is a there is an HR deficit

66
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:08,239
what comes to IT specialist so do you

67
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,859
experience do you actually feel it no

68
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:14,720
what

69
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:18,590
yes last year I had a real hunger for

70
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:22,610
specialists one one one of our staff

71
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:26,599
left our company and it was a gap for a

72
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:31,850
certain period of time so if we extend

73
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:35,570
this analogy with hunger we can say that

74
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:38,030
ok if you like to eat a lot if you then

75
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:42,349
of course you may feel this hunger if

76
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:44,299
you sometimes deprived food for a

77
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:48,980
certain period of time so the same thing

78
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:54,350
applies to specialists if you if you if

79
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:58,640
you like to have your payroll always

80
00:04:54,350 --> 00:05:01,340
filled if you have if you want to have

81
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:04,360
the right people at all times and then

82
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:07,849
of course you may experience this hunger

83
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:10,430
but if you don't care about how

84
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:13,730
professional this person is if you only

85
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:16,540
need that present ever diploma then

86
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,990
probably not ok

87
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:21,650
[Music]

88
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:26,900
I'm not ready to give you exact

89
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:32,799
statistics but I regularly monitor job

90
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:40,580
openings posted on relevant job websites

91
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:47,410
and based on my experience there has

92
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:51,710
been a shift towards more demand for

93
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:55,280
highly skilled technical professionals

94
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:57,700
that do not only hold a degree or a

95
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:02,090
certificate of completion of some course

96
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:09,260
but really have the background the

97
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:12,530
experience and expertise so the people

98
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:16,550
that can work with high level threat

99
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:18,830
detection and tag detection systems so

100
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:21,380
again there is a huge demand for these

101
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:25,219
kind of people in this demand has been

102
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:29,000
on an upward trend and hereby I wanna

103
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:36,530
ask a question this knowledge this

104
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:39,890
knowledge is very hard to transfer it's

105
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:43,989
quite hard to train these people the

106
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:49,560
people we need we cannot expect to

107
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:52,000
receive highly skilled specialists

108
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:55,270
from universes straight out of

109
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,120
universities so we have to we have to do

110
00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:01,210
our part we have to train these people

111
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:05,969
and I'd like to ask Maria how this solar

112
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:09,250
company tries to address this problem

113
00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:14,530
internally what do you do in that regard

114
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:16,500
thanks for much colleagues let me share

115
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:18,909
with you what we do in our company and

116
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:24,550
probably I'd like to throw few numbers

117
00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:27,000
at you and this light changer is not

118
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:27,000
koyukon

119
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:06,080
alright this is my slide one that's the

120
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:16,979
demographics the statistics that Mihiel

121
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:21,330
has already mentioned perhaps these are

122
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:22,830
the most recent numbers we Rostov has

123
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:28,890
not provided us with anything more

124
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:35,429
recent than this since 2010 for the

125
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:37,890
first time our mortality rate has

126
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:43,520
exceeded the birth rate for the first

127
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:48,449
time in many years if you see here the

128
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:53,160
short spike and the birth rate will not

129
00:08:48,450 --> 00:09:03,180
be able to cover as they need the demand

130
00:08:53,160 --> 00:09:09,079
for active working people so these are

131
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:09,079
the number the number after young

132
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:16,029
active working people is shown on the

133
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:18,729
slide and that does not only include the

134
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:20,350
idea specialist but who do we would we

135
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:24,579
consider what kind of people do we

136
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:27,939
consider as active awakened people look

137
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:32,859
at this segment here over here these are

138
00:09:27,939 --> 00:09:34,810
the people under the age of 20 and

139
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:38,500
people that this research was not

140
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:43,089
entirely impeccable we don't we don't

141
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:44,949
know who they are we don't know who

142
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:49,259
works on the other side of the Internet

143
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:55,180
if we ask for services in the Araneta we

144
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:57,220
we we get someone who is a 14 year old

145
00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:00,219
or a 15 year old perhaps the unit will

146
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:03,009
expand on this she can share some

147
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:06,040
information regarding the program that

148
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:09,870
was ran with school that was problem

149
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:13,660
with schools the program or pentesters

150
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:15,160
the train of contesters so this

151
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,949
information is pretty self-explanatory

152
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,469
there is no need for me to provide any

153
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:22,589
additional explanation here though let

154
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:28,290
me talk a little bit more about the

155
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:32,500
theory of generation this is a this is a

156
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:35,709
controversial theory but it's not the

157
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:39,899
question of who was born whim the

158
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:44,768
question is what historic historical

159
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:46,810
background that person receives at as

160
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:52,329
the person matures as a person is

161
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:55,180
brought up and there are baby boomers

162
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:58,809
the X Generation the Y generation dizi

163
00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:03,410
generation and the Z generation are the

164
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:06,379
people who were born post-2000

165
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:09,660
here I'd like to say a couple words

166
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:11,999
regarding the education raise your hand

167
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:15,269
if you believe that um you are from

168
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:19,369
Generation X I remember how we were

169
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:19,369
taught back at the university or college

170
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:35,160
teachers did not approve of copying

171
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:38,459
information the Internet it didn't I

172
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:41,209
mean if we copied some information from

173
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:48,209
the internet we risked getting a no

174
00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:51,988
passing grade and now the situation has

175
00:11:48,209 --> 00:12:01,589
changed and there's so much information

176
00:11:51,989 --> 00:12:04,170
out there is so many things the people

177
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:07,110
the current generation is less capable

178
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:11,118
of processing information critically

179
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:17,279
assessing it but it's more inclined to

180
00:12:11,119 --> 00:12:20,129
just digesting it without any processing

181
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,759
without any prior processing so these

182
00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:25,290
people they just absorb the information

183
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:30,169
they don't go deep

184
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:35,819
they are superficial on the other hand

185
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:39,029
people from the Y generation these

186
00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:41,329
people have their own advantages and

187
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:41,329
disadvantages

188
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:51,499
it's compared to the older generation

189
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:55,980
these people don't have you don't have

190
00:12:51,499 --> 00:13:00,629
templates or patterns they don't they

191
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:04,379
like to challenge sometimes stereotypes

192
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:06,929
or something that has that is widely

193
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:09,459
accepted can sometimes they arrive at

194
00:13:06,929 --> 00:13:15,179
unexpected

195
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:22,388
solutions that are unorthodox perhaps

196
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:25,920
and the Z generation perhaps you have

197
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:27,939
noticed if you have children these

198
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,259
people people that belong to this

199
00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:34,179
generation they are not afraid of

200
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:39,579
technology is they do not shy away from

201
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:41,069
it just as we people from the Y

202
00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:46,569
generation we're not afraid of

203
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:49,899
automobiles we use them naturally the

204
00:13:46,569 --> 00:13:53,349
people from the Z generation they are

205
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:55,889
quite skilled when it comes to

206
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:59,649
processing information when it comes to

207
00:13:55,889 --> 00:14:02,199
manipulating it when it comes to dealing

208
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:04,449
with it in the widest sense of the world

209
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:08,290
and perhaps this is going to be a real

210
00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:12,128
asset so when they become older want to

211
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:19,480
become fully adult and when they when

212
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:25,779
they come to work these people will of

213
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:27,670
course be chicken and double checking

214
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:29,259
information perhaps we will have to

215
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:31,899
prove to them that what we say is

216
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:36,029
actually true and we will have to back

217
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:39,579
it up with facts given the fact that

218
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:42,160
motivation and values motivation values

219
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:47,559
of these generations are different and

220
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:52,540
we have really faced this the main job

221
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:58,049
of an HR specialist is to be able to

222
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:58,049
kind of navigate the values and the

223
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:06,560
the values of each of these generations

224
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:11,130
to be able to create a harmonious

225
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:12,709
atmosphere in which interchange this

226
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:22,620
line please

227
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:28,830
okay I believe we don't have any choice

228
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:32,670
in other words we don't get to choose

229
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:37,130
whether we hire trained people or less

230
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:40,319
trained people and train them ourselves

231
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:45,240
we have to we have to be flexible we all

232
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:51,480
find things to do regardless of the

233
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:56,190
level of skill that the person has in

234
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:58,680
our company perhaps this is a misleading

235
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:03,330
term diffusion of responsibility but

236
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:09,150
nevertheless is what we do we cross

237
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:12,930
pollinate people in other words perform

238
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:17,720
groups in our teams that include both

239
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:24,000
younger and older people we use

240
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:26,250
mentorship we use team leads we attract

241
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:32,570
students through our student programs

242
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:35,940
from the from the universities in

243
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:38,790
localities that we are interested in we

244
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:41,400
post internship opportunities so we may

245
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:44,939
get a certain number of responses we

246
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:49,910
take them we provide internships to

247
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:52,410
these students we give them work to do

248
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:53,880
we allow these people to grow

249
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:56,030
professionally some of them come back

250
00:16:53,880 --> 00:17:00,340
and

251
00:16:56,030 --> 00:17:06,109
shall we work with us further as

252
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:07,910
full-fledged employees that allows is

253
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:10,609
the knowledge of transfer the knowledge

254
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:14,420
of skills this is what we call

255
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:19,639
cross-pollination competences are

256
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:27,670
transferred and this approach allows us

257
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:33,050
to more expeditiously train entry-level

258
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:39,080
specialists and that can that can be

259
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:40,899
entrusted with more difficult tasks that

260
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:45,199
require a higher level of responsibility

261
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:49,130
this is in this is the age breakdown of

262
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:53,680
our specialists of our employees we see

263
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:59,870
that the majority are the people over

264
00:17:53,680 --> 00:18:05,870
26-year old the other is younger than 26

265
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:09,050
years old so the older guys job is to

266
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:15,919
train as fast as possible those that a

267
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:20,450
younger and to ease them into more into

268
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:22,340
a more difficult work that requires a

269
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:27,440
higher level of responsibilities so our

270
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:32,209
job is to is to maintain this ratio one

271
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:35,300
young to older ones so regarding the

272
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:38,060
resources we we need these resources we

273
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:40,370
were all eating we're an all eatin

274
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:42,620
company in terms of in terms of the

275
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:48,679
level of skill of the people that we

276
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:50,360
hire so we don't we don't mind hiring

277
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:53,840
people that are less skilled because we

278
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:56,139
can retrain them okay speaking about the

279
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:00,820
vendor or integrator the company that

280
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:06,399
produces services so in your structure

281
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:10,049
this approach is it is it possible that

282
00:19:06,399 --> 00:19:10,049
we have the resources time and so on

283
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:18,428
even drawing these charts I mean this

284
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:21,100
approach this approach does that sound

285
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:25,409
like a viable approach this approach

286
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:27,879
based on mentorship that calls for

287
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:30,399
hiring people that are straight out of

288
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,980
college and training them can you please

289
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:35,350
repeat your question laughter so my

290
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:37,889
question is this when you are a vendor

291
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:41,350
or integrator and when your business is

292
00:19:37,889 --> 00:19:46,750
security if you know that you need a

293
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:50,740
resources HR resources you can hire you

294
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:55,230
can hire people that are fresh out of

295
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:58,059
college that don't have the right skills

296
00:19:55,230 --> 00:20:01,840
do you think it's possible to take those

297
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:05,740
fresh people and to train them up to a

298
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:09,189
point in which they are full-fledged

299
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:11,980
professionals well I believe that this

300
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:13,840
is not a unique approach and moreover

301
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:16,289
this approach cannot be anything else

302
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,289
than this

303
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:30,630
I believe that that's the way to go I'm

304
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:32,520
not a HR specialist while we were

305
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,380
creating a new department we were

306
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,780
looking for six people this was a whole

307
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:40,830
story we were looking for these people

308
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:43,290
in our branches and we tried to feel

309
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,159
this person I feel this position in my

310
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:48,930
department

311
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:56,250
I learned this new word to phrase to

312
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:59,970
fill a position but I did it and we

313
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:03,870
found the good girl um we found it in

314
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:08,250
the urals we didn't she had been

315
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:15,120
awakened in in IT security before so I

316
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:19,080
found her so I believe what the previous

317
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:24,929
speaker has discussed is very relevant

318
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:30,000
to us okay you took a girl from the perm

319
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:34,650
region but does it mean that in perm the

320
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,330
position is unfilled at this point yes

321
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:38,670
but only for a short period of time

322
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:44,939
because there is a constant professional

323
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:47,940
relocation process going on and even if

324
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:50,490
something is not fueled there that's not

325
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:55,230
for a long time so the situation is not

326
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:59,250
unique it's always it's always on did I

327
00:21:55,230 --> 00:22:01,410
ask you did I answer your question fee

328
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:04,700
is internships that you have mentioned

329
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:08,310
today I take significant resources from

330
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:11,970
full-fledged employees and how long does

331
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:15,810
it take to to train and in a trainee and

332
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:18,950
intern and in an intern the internship

333
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:24,350
takes 2.5 months

334
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:28,850
and it includes events in activities as

335
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:31,488
part of this internship program a team

336
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:35,738
lead team leader nostril work with these

337
00:22:31,489 --> 00:22:37,840
trainees it involves some prep prep

338
00:22:35,739 --> 00:22:41,929
stage

339
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:47,269
so yes the team leader has a certain

340
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:50,090
range of responsibilities no I believe

341
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:55,279
it wouldn't be a correct to say that we

342
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:58,009
we tear a professional or an employee

343
00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:00,470
from his or her responsibilities to work

344
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:03,259
with trainees no that's part of their

345
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:05,539
responsibilities how do you motivate how

346
00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:07,989
do you motivate people know we don't do

347
00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:11,330
anything special to motivate people I

348
00:23:07,989 --> 00:23:16,669
don't even think that this motivation

349
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:20,649
needs to be needs to be creative because

350
00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:24,919
once you become to begin to monetize

351
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:29,869
this introduced a monetary dimension to

352
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:33,320
this you begin to lose other forms of

353
00:23:29,869 --> 00:23:39,039
motivation I believe that the team

354
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:44,869
leader is responsible is responsible for

355
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:50,029
spending some time on the trainees and

356
00:23:44,869 --> 00:23:53,168
moreover what's more every employee is

357
00:23:50,029 --> 00:24:01,220
should be interested in training intern

358
00:23:53,169 --> 00:24:04,489
interns could you give us how many

359
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:07,429
people what percentage of people of

360
00:24:04,489 --> 00:24:08,749
these trainees or interns actually come

361
00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:10,580
back to the company's full fledged

362
00:24:08,749 --> 00:24:15,710
employees

363
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:21,750
any interns yes okay

364
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:25,740
over the past period we had over the

365
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:35,840
past two years we have had over

366
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:35,840
seventeen interns and seven people left

367
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:45,750
well I mean two people were discharged

368
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:47,940
before the into the interns and many

369
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:56,220
people have stayed for over a year

370
00:24:47,940 --> 00:25:03,060
seven people any questions okay my

371
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:04,500
question is as follows have you ever

372
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:08,179
tried to calculate the economic

373
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:13,050
components what's more economical to

374
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:16,380
hire trained skilled professionals from

375
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:21,510
the jobs market or to train your own

376
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:24,420
specialists from interns of course we do

377
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:28,379
this and we we do these calculations

378
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:34,560
we'll perform them without a regional

379
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:37,740
network you see it it depends it depends

380
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:46,500
whether you are in Moscow or outside of

381
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:53,070
Moscow in the regions regions are not so

382
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:56,220
rich in interesting and difficult tasks

383
00:25:53,070 --> 00:26:00,030
to do so it may be quite expensive to

384
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:03,210
hire an experienced professional from

385
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:04,920
Moscow because otherwise you just can't

386
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:07,250
find an experienced professional in the

387
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:09,710
regions

388
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:18,080
that would be able to perform a certain

389
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:21,799
set of tasks I talked to and I went to

390
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:24,980
the IT Director of Rostelecom and he

391
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:27,350
told me a completely different thing to

392
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:30,590
mature he told me that the majority of

393
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:33,860
people that they hire people from the

394
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:37,760
regions we also hire people from the

395
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:40,939
regions but no you have just said that

396
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:43,179
it's hard to find professionals in the

397
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:48,740
regions of whose qualifications can

398
00:26:43,179 --> 00:26:53,270
match those of the professionals in

399
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:55,700
Moscow it really depends on who we're

400
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:58,400
talking about what kind of professionals

401
00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:01,340
were talking about so it really depends

402
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:05,150
Thank You leo

403
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:14,299
my question is again for you could he

404
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:20,120
say bollocks going to talk yes I am kind

405
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:23,590
of I'm asking this question before the

406
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,590
next speech

407
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:31,280
yes we often realize that people need to

408
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:33,740
be trained but training is expensive

409
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:36,710
some of the courses are only read abroad

410
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:38,390
and it's very expensive for sometimes

411
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:40,820
prohibitively expensive to send people

412
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:43,610
abroad for training how do you address

413
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:49,790
this problem I very often hear feedback

414
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:56,240
so that you know teaching a soft

415
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:59,780
operator is difficult and this expensive

416
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:03,620
ok a very good question and a very

417
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:08,450
relevant question we conduct internal

418
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:13,070
seminars internal workshops so we assign

419
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:14,840
as an additional function to our

420
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:18,860
professionals we conduct these seminars

421
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:20,418
on a quarterly basis for example there

422
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:25,729
is a person that are responsible for

423
00:28:20,419 --> 00:28:28,760
operating a system and we get activist

424
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:33,610
training seminars that are periodic they

425
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:39,610
are part of our HR development

426
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:42,830
professional development programs and

427
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:46,479
just recently we conducted an incident

428
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:46,480
response seminar

429
00:28:47,040 --> 00:29:00,930
I I'd like to apologize I the problem

430
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:02,700
wasn't speaking loud enough so just

431
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:04,530
recently work and effort is centering a

432
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:13,370
sidewalk company this was an in-house

433
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:20,129
seminar so that's for internal

434
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:25,500
specialists internal employees the

435
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:29,220
trainees were administrators and other

436
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:30,180
colleagues we recorded the video that

437
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:33,120
were made a separate presentation

438
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:36,690
variety directors with excerpts for them

439
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,879
just to keep them in the know and you

440
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:43,190
show the results of their activities and

441
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:46,350
that was an awareness campaign it was

442
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:48,840
kind of a brief description for about an

443
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:50,820
hour or so of the whole model from which

444
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:53,610
it followed what tools should be used

445
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:57,060
and we embedded it into the corporate

446
00:29:53,610 --> 00:30:00,510
training system as a video plus QA so

447
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:03,179
now everyone arriving at the functional

448
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:07,610
roles with some functions will have this

449
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:12,210
kind of a teach it as type of this

450
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:14,159
course so in my opinion corporate

451
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:17,460
training should be replicable and

452
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:21,570
scalable so how it works with us if some

453
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:23,940
employee went away to get trained on

454
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:26,580
something and we do it from time to time

455
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:30,540
sending people over 56 day immediately

456
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:33,540
after that they should build they should

457
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:36,540
present a brief story about what they

458
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:38,790
liked what they brought from that and

459
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:41,399
share the materials even though some

460
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:46,100
training centers don't allow this to be

461
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:49,309
done but we somehow manage ok that's it

462
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:54,270
regarding the workshop

463
00:30:49,309 --> 00:30:57,780
when you presented the information about

464
00:30:54,270 --> 00:31:02,340
the seminar people have heard it they

465
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:04,940
need to prepare these ex-sas for

466
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:08,730
somebody well I think you're confused

467
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:12,030
workshop and training when I do a

468
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:16,559
workshop colleagues can adjust so

469
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:19,790
respond ask me questions answer my

470
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:23,070
questions I'm not talking about some

471
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:29,820
training outside so when I send somebody

472
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:31,980
ah so you get people back from a an

473
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:33,659
external training and then ask them to

474
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:37,799
write up an essay and share it with

475
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:40,830
employees yes yeah but you can listen to

476
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:42,900
a seminar a workshop but not bring any

477
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:45,840
value how do you solve this problem this

478
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:48,299
is the next mechanism how to assess the

479
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,770
competencies of the employee to improve

480
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:52,830
their qualification absolutely different

481
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:56,280
and how do you assess if a person has

482
00:31:52,830 --> 00:32:01,830
done two classes has gone to take two

483
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:03,840
classes and never was able to share what

484
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:06,000
they've learned but there's no

485
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,909
obligation there's no control question

486
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,169
at the end of the seminar I didn't

487
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:13,620
understand do you have anything like

488
00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:15,660
this well I'm being lost are we talking

489
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:18,350
about external train no no I will talk

490
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:21,090
about the internal workshops

491
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:23,459
competencies are trained as part of a

492
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:26,459
different mechanisms so it doesn't have

493
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:28,620
to do with training as such it's the

494
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:33,120
best verification of the processes so

495
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:36,899
you periodically run qualification or

496
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:40,110
skills verification not exactly we just

497
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:42,960
test the process process consists of

498
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:44,879
some sub processes so a you test

499
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,740
specific specialist who should be

500
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,890
involved in the process thank you I got

501
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,890
it

502
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:57,350
from myself I'll risk making a

503
00:32:53,510 --> 00:33:02,500
hypothesis that some skills that you

504
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:06,699
need everyday you can indeed do it

505
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:11,840
through this train the trainer through

506
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:13,549
looking over the shoulder of a person

507
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,559
you can do that but when it comes to

508
00:33:13,549 --> 00:33:18,168
some specialized skills then there is a

509
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:21,918
big question of where to send a person

510
00:33:18,169 --> 00:33:26,750
to get trained and as far as I know

511
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:30,799
Vitali approached this task many times

512
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:34,639
over and they've recently got this

513
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:37,340
program regarding internship so can you

514
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:39,350
talk about that yeah colleagues hi

515
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:43,899
everyone my name is Vijay Malkin I'm

516
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:47,449
head of security assessment Department

517
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:49,850
I'm not a very far away who have great

518
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:52,490
HR people whom I love dearly

519
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:54,709
I'm trying to help but unfortunately the

520
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:59,990
problem that we faced some time in

521
00:33:54,710 --> 00:34:02,510
August last year was that we had to grow

522
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:05,330
the number of employees in our business

523
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:08,960
by about 12 people to cope with the

524
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:12,429
business so - we had to hire 12 pen

525
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:14,389
testers in six months believe me I

526
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:17,750
understood there's nobody else how

527
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:20,569
difficult is to work with HR I have no

528
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:23,418
idea about Generation X Y or Z it's so

529
00:34:20,569 --> 00:34:25,639
very far away from me because it seemed

530
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:28,668
to me and again it's my own personal

531
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:31,730
opinion that pen testers guys who are

532
00:34:28,668 --> 00:34:34,908
very strong and IT security can't be

533
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:37,819
measured with this yardstick at all well

534
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:40,480
some of them may be a workaholic another

535
00:34:37,819 --> 00:34:43,190
person can behave maybe have as a say a

536
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:46,040
generation a person and so on so forth

537
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:49,490
so I think it's not absolutely right to

538
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:53,690
apply these yardsticks to them and two

539
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:55,158
more things what I'd like to argue with

540
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:58,289
marina for once

541
00:34:55,159 --> 00:35:01,710
I'm surely not prepared to

542
00:34:58,289 --> 00:35:04,799
hire a 14 or 15 year old as a pen tester

543
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:09,150
because I guarantee even if it's about

544
00:35:04,799 --> 00:35:11,880
some remote client and they will bring

545
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:14,220
down some remote system and the SCADA

546
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,990
system and all the benefit that you've

547
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:21,328
got from having to pay them smaller

548
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:25,078
salary will be run over but by the need

549
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:28,430
to reimburse the client so even the

550
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:31,410
young specialist so just going through

551
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:33,180
internship well frankly I'm not prepared

552
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:36,149
I've seen a lot through this life and

553
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:40,169
I'm not saying to hire them now about

554
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:41,789
how we solve this problem so in 12 pen

555
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:46,109
testers how I approached saw this

556
00:35:41,789 --> 00:35:49,470
problem so we had 12 fantastis and just

557
00:35:46,109 --> 00:35:52,019
recently we have monitoring departments

558
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:54,959
professionals and so we're going to have

559
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:57,868
same problems with anti-fraud with fraud

560
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,670
control and so on so forth I'm sure many

561
00:35:57,869 --> 00:36:02,250
of you have encountered the situations

562
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:04,619
of course it can hire a specialist it

563
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:08,339
would be a super competent in this area

564
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:12,720
who's had a lot of projects behind the

565
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:16,170
back but let's be objective so now this

566
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:19,549
is their generation of Y generation they

567
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:22,470
ask for such salaries that you just

568
00:36:19,549 --> 00:36:24,960
understand that it's cheaper to hire

569
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:28,140
consultants who will do it for you than

570
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,420
to build this function within so

571
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:33,690
therefore we've arrived at the same idea

572
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:36,750
and we said we're high class company or

573
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:38,700
have lots of you know talented guys who

574
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:42,269
can raise lectures we have a huge

575
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:48,078
community let's try doing something on

576
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:51,720
our own some internship and to be frank

577
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:55,079
we were inspired when we organized this

578
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:57,000
internship program with Yandex

579
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:59,220
cybersecurity school I think that was

580
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,180
the name of it especially in the

581
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:09,500
beginning where we just took

582
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:12,560
and using all the known channels with

583
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,870
universities with pentester community we

584
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:17,570
just announce that we're running

585
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:24,460
internship as part of which we'll be

586
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:27,560
training guys a lot of processes and

587
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:29,330
this led us to get quite a few people

588
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,970
involved the whole structure was like

589
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:37,360
this first we ran an announcement in a

590
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:40,520
mass media then we selected 30 best

591
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:45,290
contenders through an examination

592
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:46,220
process then we ran our classes till the

593
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:49,040
end of May

594
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:50,839
they were very diverse we had for

595
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,660
instance guys from positive technologies

596
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:56,330
to talk about cm and so on so forth we

597
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:59,029
had a very exciting class on Hardware

598
00:37:56,330 --> 00:38:04,640
programming which hardware can be used

599
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:07,130
and yes based on the results we now plan

600
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:09,490
to hire six to seven people from what

601
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:12,830
from how many I'll tell you in a minute

602
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:15,709
implementations initially we had 340

603
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:18,430
people for your understanding these are

604
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:20,990
people are from the entire country I

605
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:24,560
absolutely don't subscribe to the idea

606
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:27,770
that people in remote regions have worst

607
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:30,290
skills than here in Moscow there are

608
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:32,780
very powerful groups in the south of

609
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:34,970
Russia in saint-petersburg which quite

610
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,570
often are even stronger than those in

611
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:37,790
Moscow

612
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:42,250
so I assure you there is quite easy to

613
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:45,250
find specialists in regions who are as

614
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:48,260
competent as those as anybody in Moscow

615
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:50,120
we got quite a lot of people through

616
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:53,210
telegram and this is no surprise because

617
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:57,859
the most popular social media among

618
00:38:53,210 --> 00:39:00,620
those that we're targeting second was VK

619
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:01,900
and number three were Facebook's you

620
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:04,190
know what a mouse

621
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:07,490
announcements in universities of these

622
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:09,230
340 people were selected 30 and the

623
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:12,680
questions there were not just like

624
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:16,490
please tell me which protocols use DNS

625
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:19,700
and which ports these were questions

626
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:22,790
that weren't very deep our main goal was

627
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:27,529
to choose those people who were prepared

628
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:30,110
to delve into an absolutely new material

629
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:32,960
for them who want to do that and are

630
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:35,510
capable of doing this very fast this in

631
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,420
my opinion is the most important thing

632
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:39,350
about hiring young people you won't be

633
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,750
able to find a person who knows

634
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:46,990
everything but you may have a hope to

635
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:53,620
get a person who takes little time to

636
00:39:46,990 --> 00:40:00,229
get the handle and something new so we

637
00:39:53,620 --> 00:40:04,100
had several questions about the tcp/ip

638
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:06,440
protocol stack well just ten of those -

639
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:09,049
or networks - and forensics - an

640
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:13,670
offensive processes but these were just

641
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:16,700
basic questions just to show that people

642
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:19,880
have an idea rather than to test the

643
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:24,410
knowledge of these 340 people we

644
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:27,440
selected the best 30 of which only half

645
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:29,859
for students - was called kids and there

646
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:33,560
were about 30 percent of people with

647
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:36,560
actual experience working of work in IT

648
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:39,470
or not I - you had a guy who was selling

649
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:41,770
bananas in an open Street Market and he

650
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:44,540
passed everything with flying colors and

651
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:49,570
he passed the exam and we invited him

652
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:54,950
for attended learning unfortunately he

653
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:57,050
didn't make it because he didn't he

654
00:40:54,950 --> 00:41:01,069
lived outside Moscow but we keep in

655
00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:05,540
touch with him of those 30 people well

656
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:08,360
several who couldn't attend because we

657
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:12,980
hadn't ended class so there were 10 of

658
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:15,170
those so 20 people ended up with us and

659
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:17,750
they were absolutely different

660
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:21,109
is already working in a major bank guys

661
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:25,160
in the first year at the universe

662
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:29,480
Murphy a university engineer and physics

663
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:32,240
there were guys who were winning number

664
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:39,290
one and number two places in hackers

665
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:45,950
contests so only 19 of those 20 went all

666
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:50,569
the way to the exam first a few words

667
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:52,939
about the learning format we split those

668
00:41:50,569 --> 00:41:55,900
people in several groups as it was a

669
00:41:52,940 --> 00:42:03,410
representative like acting like a tutor

670
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:07,369
from our employees the informal

671
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:10,460
communication framework for them helping

672
00:42:07,369 --> 00:42:13,010
them to understand how a work that you

673
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:15,530
work is done in this society the main

674
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:18,380
competitors I said offensive defensive

675
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:25,880
red and blue team a fraud control and

676
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:28,089
forensics and we tried to give as much

677
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:32,390
information to them as possible

678
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:36,980
including organization information but

679
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:41,859
the focus was on technology what we did

680
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:44,450
and I pray that everybody does the same

681
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:47,150
doing this we made our lectures

682
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:50,569
absolutely open lectures are available

683
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:52,790
on YouTube each can find them and get

684
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:54,440
some information so basically your

685
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:55,880
writing is you're running such events

686
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:58,690
not only for ourselves but for the

687
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:00,920
community as a whole because in a year

688
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:03,710
if somebody wants to learn about a

689
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:05,930
security they go to youtube and they'll

690
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:07,700
be able to find some valuable

691
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:11,990
information there

692
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:14,450
hands-on was actually quite closed

693
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:17,750
because there are problems offering

694
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:20,359
access to your infrastructure so that

695
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:22,790
was actually a boon for them to justify

696
00:43:20,359 --> 00:43:25,640
their participation it looks very much

697
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:28,279
like what is happening across the wall

698
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:30,828
in the standoff area of course I'm sure

699
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:32,690
many of you will want implement

700
00:43:30,829 --> 00:43:34,280
something with your company and they may

701
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:36,380
be having a question of how much does it

702
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:42,170
cost because it sounds like a huge

703
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:44,210
amount of money you just hiring people

704
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:47,599
is not a simple thing to do

705
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:53,380
so my call is from uniforms ashita won't

706
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:53,380
allow me to tell you a lie we did it

707
00:43:53,530 --> 00:44:02,710
about perhaps 1% of a Chinaman's 10 10

708
00:44:00,349 --> 00:44:05,770
to 12 hours perhaps one person also

709
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:09,349
there was the marketing person helping

710
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:12,170
to advertise the rest of the time was

711
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:14,540
taken from the time of our department of

712
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:18,460
my department while of my department and

713
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:21,290
the team this whole pen tester community

714
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:24,890
does need to be invested and incentivize

715
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:26,930
by money so please read the lecture and

716
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:30,020
I'll pay you know they're all motivated

717
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:33,109
by the feeling of involvement the

718
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:35,420
financial cost was only in one thing was

719
00:44:33,109 --> 00:44:38,960
only bertone think the organization of

720
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:43,400
the final exam it cost in 25,000 room

721
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:45,140
rubles nothing on that 125 hours of

722
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,369
remain professional some prizes

723
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:51,470
certificate

724
00:44:46,369 --> 00:44:55,069
it isn't cost alone in actual fact this

725
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:59,450
is basically all very happy that almost

726
00:44:55,069 --> 00:45:02,770
all of the guys got to the end and we

727
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:04,790
invited them all to PhD they're all here

728
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:07,640
somebody

729
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:09,170
of our team are still leading in the

730
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:11,120
scoreboard they're taking part in

731
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:15,050
standoff and on the whole I have no

732
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:17,240
questions regarding who to hire you

733
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:21,350
mature especially so young ones it's a

734
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:24,799
matter of money material specialists so

735
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:29,210
can you are pen tests on analysis but do

736
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:33,670
a fraud control hugely overpriced in the

737
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:38,930
market now just because there's like a

738
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:40,490
skill hunger in the market I know that

739
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:43,759
there are companies are hiring pen

740
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:47,060
testers for 450 thousand rubles a month

741
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:49,220
just imagine it's the price of a

742
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:52,549
mid-level manager and this we're talking

743
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:55,310
about you young guy is 20 to 25 years

744
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:57,950
old my opinions just mind-blowing so

745
00:45:55,310 --> 00:46:00,860
it's now not an option to hire mature

746
00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:03,049
specialists because the good ones cost a

747
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:06,850
lot and bad ones will bring you more

748
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:06,850
problems than solutions thank you

749
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:24,740
questions ideas wishes Nikita Kurganov

750
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:28,270
Kaspersky Lab 450,000 as a mid-level

751
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:32,629
management where well there are places

752
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:34,610
I'm not talking about some really cool

753
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:35,540
company but informs that she's not in

754
00:46:34,610 --> 00:46:41,230
the forms Ishita

755
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:45,610
no but it's a stable price tag let's say

756
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:48,440
in the retail companies that's for sure

757
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:50,390
well maybe more I don't know well

758
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:52,940
frankly I have no idea of just a pen

759
00:46:50,390 --> 00:47:03,650
tester I'm not prepared to say I just

760
00:46:52,940 --> 00:47:09,200
know that it's lot it is a lot gas

761
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:13,130
inform service you said that you've got

762
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:15,939
this idea internally to train students

763
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:20,120
and then I have a question you said that

764
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:23,870
HR only accounted for one percent of

765
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:29,270
your efforts didn't they envy you for

766
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:31,190
this Maria may ask you to answer what

767
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:35,570
they jealous so when they were jealous

768
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:37,580
or not I thought that we did it for

769
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:41,540
their benefit to reduce their workload

770
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:44,750
because they also have some internships

771
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:47,690
in informs a shooter and we try to do it

772
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:52,070
internally the way we saw it it looks so

773
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:54,680
like it's working so far thank you for

774
00:47:52,070 --> 00:48:00,050
your presentation very inspiring two

775
00:47:54,680 --> 00:48:02,870
questions you said that it's about zero

776
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:04,730
training cost so initially this

777
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:07,190
advertising campaign across the

778
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:09,440
universities how much did it cost you it

779
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:13,010
didn't cost us anything we didn't

780
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:15,350
publish in some media that were asking

781
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:17,810
money for that it was in the free

782
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:22,710
environment telegram channels for

783
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:25,350
instance you know we mentioned this idea

784
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:29,040
guy running a channel with 12,000

785
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:31,560
subscribers interested in IT security in

786
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:36,240
telegram and now zero rubles zero

787
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:40,470
confidence that that was PR spending and

788
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:44,629
the second question what's the size of

789
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:47,359
your cater of experienced employees

790
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:53,550

don't need more this is what we're kind

798
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:17,640
of developed but we also understand that

799
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:20,669
the will be future needs

800
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:24,029
young guys and also we're not only doing

801
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:26,760

805
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:37,920
understanding at the head that informs a

806
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:43,020

about personal data we didn't collect

818
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:18,720
anything because we were fearing the

819
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:22,140
control bodies so 4340 people universe

820
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:23,959
140 people or four attended training no

821
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:27,230

825
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:41,509
the 14th of March and out of those 340

826
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:43,640
people we selected 30 and what were the

827
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:46,460
cause these were the internal cost that

828
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:50,720
was included in 160 hours but Syria had

829
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:53,089
them the costs of one hour of work of an

830
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:55,399
employee multiplied by the number of

831
00:50:53,089 --> 00:50:58,700
hours and then what was happening after

832
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:00,740
that how many people did you take in at

833
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:03,348
the outputs so for you to understand the

834
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:05,839
time to develop the test for each test

835
00:51:03,349 --> 00:51:07,910
was not more than four to eight hours

836
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:09,440
for development of the processing for

837
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:11,210
development are you talking about the

838
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,670
processing yes because you need to

839
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:15,710
process the results well it was a bit

840
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:18,080
different difficult more difficult with

841
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:20,720
the processing but we wrote some

842
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:22,940
software to handle most of the questions

843
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:25,549
we just needed to keep track that

844
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:29,359
everything was right for the processing

845
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:32,960
yeah perhaps about 20 to 25 hours all

846
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:35,900
told and what was the people conversion

847
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:38,630
later it's good idea of the 20 people

848
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:40,400
that we now have and again the

849
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:44,630
internship is coming to an end in June

850
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:47,630
in June we're going to run a final exams

851
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:50,200
or we already have demand in our

852
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:55,280
department so for four or five hours of

853
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:58,299
these interns in anti-fraud about three

854
00:51:55,280 --> 00:52:02,440
people and were still helping that our

855
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:04,910
SLC our sock will also employ two three

856
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:07,609
interns that will provide them twelve

857
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:09,890
people that's the expected number well

858
00:52:07,609 --> 00:52:12,950
yes perhaps you can call it that because

859
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:15,470
in JIT we had a similar several similar

860
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:18,109
internship also did it but on a broader

861
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:20,330
basis we didn't only do it and pen test

862
00:52:18,109 --> 00:52:23,779
but for the entire information security

863
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:26,000
Center but the devil hides of the

864
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:31,130
details the conversion there was about

865
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:33,920
ten percent or so and in actual fact the

866
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:35,380
main thing is that when they've gone

867
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:39,700
through the class

868
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:43,750
they are very grateful I still encounter

869
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:48,189
some people in the market who passed

870
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:49,930
this internship that is great but as

871
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:51,940
soon as I start issuing officer them the

872
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:54,549
situation may change erratically I

873
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:56,950
absolutely agree with you yes indeed

874
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:59,400
it's so but at least we're going to know

875
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:59,399
here
