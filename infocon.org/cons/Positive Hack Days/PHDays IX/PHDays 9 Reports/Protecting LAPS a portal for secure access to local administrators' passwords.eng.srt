not many do you raise ahead but sooner

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:48,149
leaders a pen tester so gets the domain

15
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:50,430
admin rights and why it happens because

16
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:52,260
in the typical Windows infrastructure

17
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:56,190
can identify the following groups of

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:58,379
admins so support of the users and so

19
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,870
that workstations that can appear it was

20
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:05,570
remote and physically close to the

21
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:09,210
computer then and then admin group

22
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:12,089
Windows servers people who maintain the

23
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:16,380
system so applications and each of the

24
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:18,689
points so where they input their

25
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,580
information so they can compromise the

26
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:24,149
entire domain because the systems are

27
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:27,770
interconnected and so we just put

28
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:31,890
together the main two techniques of

29
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:35,240
compromising the credentials so input

30
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:39,479
capture credentials dumping input prompt

31
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:44,189
network sniffing etc and the server they

32
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:47,189
get passwords from the from from RAM so

33
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:50,279
which makes the pentesters life easier

34
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:52,648
but in life it getting more and more

35
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:57,420
difficult so even look at the common

36
00:01:52,649 --> 00:02:00,869
flaws privileged access that we have in

37
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,270
any organization so it's a first it's a

38
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:06,180
non non unique password for enable built

39
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:09,008
in local administrator account because

40
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,950
the workstations usually

41
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:15,459
so then they have standard passwords and

42
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:17,920
how to change the password using the

43
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:22,410
same account for productivity tasks

44
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:25,869
email internet etc and for admin tasks

45
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:28,630
especially when this account is admin at

46
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:31,660
more than one computer so if there are

47
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:35,470
many many more than one host Windows

48
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:38,680
host working stations or a server and

49
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:41,980
then saving saving passwords so then

50
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:45,700
sometimes they admin so could be not bad

51
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:48,880
or special soft where for for storing

52
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:51,310
sitting passwords and sitting for add

53
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,470
credentials and manager and then using

54
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,880
accounts with admin rights at dirty

55
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,489
workstations

56
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,410
so when eventually so the technical

57
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:02,470
support guys that goes to the users

58
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:08,170
working stations install software and

59
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:12,100
then can enter its own information on

60
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:13,809
the user's computer and then then if

61
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:17,230
there is malware it will immediately

62
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:20,920
catch it and that the artifacts or the

63
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:23,980
password in the form of hashes so then

64
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:27,700
smart cards so they are not the 2fa

65
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:30,600
replacement because we need to be be

66
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:33,640
aware of anti hash rotation not every

67
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,950
you can again just abandon out

68
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,760
notification in every structure the den

69
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:42,910
credentials card that appears in twenty

70
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:46,298
and ended at the interpreting system

71
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:49,299
number ten and higher so they they could

72
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:55,120
be bypassed with malicious security

73
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:57,880
support provider's so there are links

74
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,640
you can always read more about that and

75
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:03,609
then not to invent something that has

76
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,279
been invented and undo the security

77
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:08,650
secure privileged access and microsoft

78
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,049
placed a special document describing

79
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:15,310
basic principles and there is quick wins

80
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:17,900
so the list of the events that is very

81
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,910
cheap for the organization

82
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:22,099
but they are low-hanging fruits and

83
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:25,400
server efficient is to increase the

84
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:32,080
level of security very quickly so basic

85
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:36,049
has so then separate working station

86
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:39,800
isolated monitoring working station and

87
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:41,960
then dividing accounts into into

88
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:46,580
standard and privileged and then another

89
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:50,330
and there so then just just in time just

90
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:54,229
in time password local admin password

91
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:56,630
sort of privileged so then it's given on

92
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:59,150
on Dementor after certain administrate

93
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,889
at miss so miss nature should not know

94
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:03,320
this password does have to have this

95
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:09,110
passwords all the time and it's now with

96
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:12,349
the help of labs utility and in the

97
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:14,630
document we have it that when administer

98
00:05:12,349 --> 00:05:19,759
and when you work under working stations

99
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:24,770
it's not allowed to use the main the

100
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:29,570
main the main entry that has privileges

101
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:35,120
so this is the domain of entry of the

102
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:37,280
administrator as I can easily cancel the

103
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,099
station because not correct I saw it in

104
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,710
the right one is a necessity to get to

105
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:46,580
query for they put the passport of local

106
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:49,698
entry the working station so that we

107
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:51,830
generate with the help of labs and so

108
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:54,830
retrieve this local account password set

109
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:58,310
by ellipse from and that what is what is

110
00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:02,780
laps so those who don't know laps is is

111
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:05,330
a client to utility or Microsoft so they

112
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:09,619
have PowerShell module and GPO templates

113
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:13,219
but the main idea that this is something

114
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:15,860
that provides opportunity of rotating

115
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:19,909
the path mordant and keep it in Active

116
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:23,360
Directory special attribute that stores

117
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:25,520
the the clear text labs password and the

118
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,599
time when the password should change so

119
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,058
it works various

120
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:30,649
in a stable manner no problems okay

121
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:33,050
we're introduced laughs now we have

122
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:35,719
under working stations on the servers so

123
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,819
have the local unique network or local

124
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:40,039
musician but how to use it and

125
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:42,469
throughout the challenges so then a

126
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:44,688
technical support guy comes up to the

127
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:47,479
computer here was the password the local

128
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:49,249
administrator what he wants to do so

129
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:52,308
their clients application can launch on

130
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:54,649
powerful spring and and and then and

131
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:57,289
then he does its own his own entries

132
00:06:54,649 --> 00:07:00,589
thus it can be compromised them but

133
00:06:57,289 --> 00:07:03,050
lapse keeps bad passwords open though it

134
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:05,599
is a special attribute but it still if

135
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:08,719
you have the rights to read these

136
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,248
attributes so that you can easily have

137
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:12,699
put in a request and get all the

138
00:07:10,249 --> 00:07:16,339
passwords from all working stations and

139
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:19,789
workstations and so what to do there is

140
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:22,669
no network you'll come to the host and

141
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:24,979
so there is no network and they cannot

142
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:31,068
get the password so no mechanism until

143
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:32,869
factor two to FA not supported and and

144
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:35,449
that's why since this application

145
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:40,909
standards application is windows so it

146
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:44,839
cannot be do the limitations of the a

147
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:47,808
life a life span of the session and also

148
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:49,130
justice you cannot you cannot set the

149
00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:53,460
path

150
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:57,060
and so sometimes necessary just go into

151
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:59,969
this workstations and and an RDP session

152
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,650
and there so he goes for lunch but the

153
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:05,040
application is open and we start to

154
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:08,700
collect passwords again and then and

155
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:11,280
then so then so the user can set to long

156
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,390
password expiration time and and then it

157
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,150
will not be changed

158
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:17,430
so it's problem for monitoring because

159
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:19,140
if you do the audit of access to this I

160
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:22,650
attribute that IP address will not be

161
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:26,010
fixed and so it just says that this is

162
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:28,950
this user went to the main computer and

163
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:31,680
then another very important point many

164
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:35,970
don't know just that if there is a

165
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:40,980
special entry that allows to enter the

166
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:44,180
machine into the domain that it has the

167
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:46,800
rights to all attributes and it is why

168
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:48,780
so then then labs and permission to join

169
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,349
compute the main do not forget to modify

170
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:56,640
computer on the rights so these are the

171
00:08:52,350 --> 00:09:00,480
problems and so this is the question and

172
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,430
our wannabes first what we want when it

173
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,850
comfortable when is it pretty

174
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:07,459
comfortable comfortable usage usage and

175
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:10,740
that we wanted to give the

176
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:13,470
administrators a comfortable way should

177
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:16,470
be something about web web portal so to

178
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:19,950
guarantee that we could get access from

179
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:22,760
UNIX from Windows should be mobile app

180
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:29,070
preferably to get local admin passwords

181
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:33,020
the southern 2fd to have a capture yeah

182
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:35,910
etc then registration of IP addresses

183
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:39,000
integration or say museum system might

184
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:41,130
be login high availability about remote

185
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,680
support secure passwords backup in case

186
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:48,150
of 80 and availability etcetera that's

187
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:50,498
what these are all wannabes and so this

188
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:53,079
is what we got so we call code

189
00:09:50,499 --> 00:09:54,939
the web laps this web portal plus mobile

190
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:59,348
app in Java

191
00:09:54,939 --> 00:10:01,629
hmm Java app so there should be a good

192
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:05,469
for Windows and UNIX the works under

193
00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:07,629
windows in service a demon mode he one

194
00:10:05,469 --> 00:10:12,849
is compromised the the system will work

195
00:10:07,629 --> 00:10:17,399
on UNIX and the third EMBs can use so

196
00:10:12,849 --> 00:10:21,459
built-in SQLite or external mi skill

197
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:24,159
married and and high availability is is

198
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:27,218
provided and they saw dangerous and then

199
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:29,859
the circle always a request passwords so

200
00:10:27,219 --> 00:10:33,249
that's what the screen looks like a

201
00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:36,579
rebel apps web GUI mobile app it repeats

202
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:43,149
the interface of Microsoft applications

203
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:45,899
away so we had just the coca you can

204
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:48,819
just add computers to select that item

205
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:53,039
in the mobile application of I have the

206
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:56,169
same functionality concerning

207
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:58,149
authentication so there are two modes so

208
00:10:56,169 --> 00:11:00,399
then at your discretion you can

209
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:05,679
implement this or that so the left one

210
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:08,409
is - - fa so when they ask for carefully

211
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:13,358
passwords and one time code at one time

212
00:11:08,409 --> 00:11:15,759
password and so then war has its OTP

213
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:20,970
providers or well there is no embedded

214
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:26,109
service then then you can use and in

215
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:29,519
built in 8000 TP per provider and if I

216
00:11:26,109 --> 00:11:33,489
make a decision that so we can use both

217
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:37,329
the software from dirties workstations

218
00:11:33,489 --> 00:11:39,369
and that mean and the one one passport

219
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:41,949
one-time password so that's it and they

220
00:11:39,369 --> 00:11:43,610
will be so then the then the passport

221
00:11:41,949 --> 00:11:46,719
will not be a key

222
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:51,440
we'll be stored on the user's computer

223
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:55,149
and so then so we just we developed this

224
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,660
mobile and we added support from push

225
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:58,310
authentification

226
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:01,600
so you just put the button and then

227
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:05,899
immediately comes support or not support

228
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:08,630
registers not registered then then user

229
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:12,470
sessions user session protection so

230
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:15,589
there are mechanism server but so log of

231
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:18,380
idle users log off on the remote

232
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:23,029
connection detection window size color

233
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:23,630
depth chart changes yes color colour

234
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:27,290
change

235
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:29,329
NASA if it changes that means someone

236
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:31,880
connected to the users through DP and

237
00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:34,519
then we do automatic logoff and then the

238
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:40,730
session is connected is bound to the

239
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:45,649
source IP to the source IP and then if

240
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:50,269
they are so loose so the the password so

241
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:54,079
then they they they reflect all events

242
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:56,870
of security as all events and and then

243
00:12:54,079 --> 00:13:00,439
there is an imbalance event and then you

244
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:03,230
can import so all these events in this

245
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:06,380
form then about access control

246
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:09,560
configuration if if the company is for

247
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:11,990
the volar russia like in our case so

248
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,790
then the hcg administrator should see

249
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:16,310
all the passwords computers from home

250
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:19,790
from his own computers and this so that

251
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:21,979
is why so we do the mapping of a you and

252
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,899
if you are part of the group then you

253
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:27,769
will get the passwords only from your

254
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:30,920
own region and then another thing that

255
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:33,260
we faced so there was a task as add

256
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,760
another administrator and then a

257
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:37,010
technical support unit

258
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:39,350
so the first have access to all computer

259
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:41,449
said there are some users so that that

260
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,970
gives supported applications as

261
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:45,459
seungho's

262
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:48,940
they could be 50 holes 400 holes and

263
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:50,710
that and actually and we not want to add

264
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:53,170
them to the grow that were Corral to

265
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:55,410
request the passwords well computers and

266
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:58,540
as we need to do the attribute that is

267
00:13:55,410 --> 00:14:05,500
reflects either the the entry or the

268
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:08,430
attribute yeah and and there's another

269
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:11,260
to guarantee that you identify the

270
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:14,189
accidents so when we scan the Porsche or

271
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:17,590
something else or then strange activity

272
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:19,870
then certain certain instruments allow

273
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,850
us to enter the workstations in

274
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:24,520
automatic mode and collect forensic

275
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:28,810
information so that the system could

276
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:31,689
enter so then you do the IP key for the

277
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:34,569
API access so the API is connected to a

278
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:37,260
pack IP address and the system

279
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:40,510
automatically can request password soon

280
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:45,040
and then another mechanism of protection

281
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:48,189
is when too many requests so then the

282
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,079
session identification expired and it's

283
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:52,500
not it's not logged on and the bad guy

284
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:55,560
got an access so then there are some

285
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:58,630
system the system as to the number of

286
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:05,619
how many times the password is requested

287
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:09,850
and there's a limit and then other

288
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:12,790
features is so one of the ways one of

289
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:14,650
the ways so if we saw the expiration

290
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:17,829
time of the password is one to one

291
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:19,180
minute so that we requested the password

292
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:21,220
and

293
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:23,170
and then within the administration and I

294
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,300
wanted to be changed then we can

295
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:27,729
forcefully put the expiration time of

296
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,800
the password at the plus one minute for

297
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:34,810
example and then there is a difficulty

298
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:38,410
that in if a replicated not immediately

299
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:40,180
then twenty to forty minutes has already

300
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:42,850
passed before their application comes

301
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,410
toll the control controllers so that not

302
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:46,540
to force the admin to do this

303
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,730
optimization and their application so we

304
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:52,449
just do the push push this all these

305
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:53,980
changes to each domain controller time

306
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:57,300
out to a spoke about that so we can

307
00:15:53,980 --> 00:16:00,130
limit the at the maximum time a lifetime

308
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:02,319
so this always said we don't want it to

309
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:04,180
change in three years later and

310
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,460
automatically at each request of the

311
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:09,880
password the system will immediately

312
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:11,320
dated and after the request of the

313
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,410
passwords will change change the

314
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:17,320
passwords in sixty minutes in this case

315
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:19,870
and so that mean for more comfort for

316
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:24,190
that min so we have the quick launch

317
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:27,330
buttons and so then a command command

318
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:30,490
line and then with the help of our

319
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:32,530
special special templates I can put the

320
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:36,240
name of the computer a guillotine and

321
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:39,880
the password and it works only and he i

322
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,950
IE only so then the user to launch it

323
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:45,130
just with one button can also go down

324
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:46,960
into the session but able to RDP client

325
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,939
that does not support the transfer or

326
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,890
password to through the command line

327
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:55,120
and so then there is a there is a

328
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:58,689
special there is a special a special

329
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,790
combination of words that will put the

330
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:02,980
password into the exchange buffer and

331
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:06,010
candy and the user could get it later

332
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:08,500
there and so then let's Mobile is the

333
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:12,700
same interface not a difference being it

334
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:16,750
supports the so as s ID and so the

335
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:18,480
fingerprint works as well and so the

336
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,609
main features

337
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,699
that doctor guaranteed immobile

338
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:26,819
operations so have only one at pointa

339
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:30,630
and it supports the the masking of the

340
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:35,070
endpoint if you want to so they would

341
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:38,809
elapse dot domain.com so that the miss

342
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:42,649
Corinth could not see it in our zone and

343
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:46,740
so we can always place it in an existing

344
00:17:42,649 --> 00:17:49,889
balancer and add some some traction

345
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:54,200
there and then only our users will know

346
00:17:49,889 --> 00:17:59,010
about that and so as you when you

347
00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:02,460
install sodium of application so first

348
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:05,460
initialization J is a G key generated

349
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,289
during device enrollment process also to

350
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:10,019
sensitive information is additional

351
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:13,889
encrypted during transmission over TLS

352
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:16,889
and then we imported and then they then

353
00:18:13,889 --> 00:18:19,949
the bad guy will not see anything son

354
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:22,379
and the server that had a server side so

355
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:23,490
device profile checkers at server-side

356
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,880
platform

357
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:30,659
OS version device ID etc is done and

358
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:35,340
then then push notification I spoke

359
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:37,769
about and ideas for future releases so

360
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:39,539
one just windows thick client windows

361
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:42,120
thing client but the clip that will be

362
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:45,120
in tray now or in the context menu will

363
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:49,620
be added to guarantee quick launch from

364
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:51,750
standard so that you could go away from

365
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:56,219
this standard application that's what

366
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:58,860
will guarantee a quick RDP launch I can

367
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:01,139
get to get a passport with OTP I put the

368
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:03,600
credentials manager open RDP cooling

369
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:06,330
credentials manager easy

370
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,990
and then we can do the mechanism that

371
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:14,760
would add the users right the user

372
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:16,500
rights of he wants us to not to keep his

373
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,680
account in these privileged groups for

374
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:22,650
example so you can if he went through

375
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:24,240
the two-factor authentication so then he

376
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:28,470
gets groups and in an hour's time

377
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:32,370
removed the little group after defined

378
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:34,110
time out so then so that's it if you

379
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:36,060
have any suggestions amendments

380
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:38,419
proposals of be happy to implement a

381
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,419
thank you

382
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,119
[Music]

383
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:16,750
because whether introduced elapsed so

384
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,970
the first thing we did is we we took

385
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,410
stock of all the accounts that were

386
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:22,720
added to the local group of

387
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:30,900
administrators so they need to be

388
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:30,900
cleaned out rather edit enter account

389
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:42,460
yeah but we are a getting away from this

390
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:44,320
from the subject that's monitoring of

391
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:46,630
abnormal activity of the work stations

392
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,110
and naturally if I see the abnormal

393
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:49,110
activity

394
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:13,340
yeah so to do the detect of a remote

395
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:18,570
connection but the first thing that

396
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:20,580
comes at a occurs to me that pin test

397
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:24,740
being tested near from some virtual

398
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:27,780
machine and then full-hd and then a

399
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:30,870
redesign of the screen occurs and the

400
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:33,389
screen size changes no no it's not an

401
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:36,379
event we launched the the user has the

402
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:38,790
browser the browser JavaScript watches

403
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:41,160
regularly the width of the screen and

404
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:43,590
height of the screen and the depth of

405
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:45,480
the screen and so once so like you know

406
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:47,370
successful because we remember the first

407
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:51,030
one which with which the user came in

408
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:53,370
entered so when the end and so on when

409
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:55,649
he is not pure Asian there's a changes

410
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:58,110
so some just remote connected to his

411
00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:00,930
workstations but all these values change

412
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:02,969
so we think if they change then we think

413
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:04,680
that that there is a connection to the

414
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:09,360
user so it's not the windows event it's

415
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:12,560
not OS it's the fact on the web at the

416
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,560
level of application

417
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:23,570
[Music]

418
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:27,200
in the event so they detect some

419
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:30,990
suspicious activity you know - you take

420
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:34,500
the majority the majority of logs from

421
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:37,140
the workstations for forensic for more

422
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:41,400
in-depth forensic so then you as you

423
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:44,490
that the security logs collected and you

424
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,830
collect all other no no it's not very no

425
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:48,870
no it's a different subject for

426
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:51,120
discussion for a new presentation but

427
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:55,979
the AG is that there is a we're um we're

428
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:59,070
work mail warm cancer so we adapted it

429
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:01,830
to our needs so we had it at the cortex

430
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:04,860
to hive added it to cortex in hive and

431
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:08,070
see him registered and anomaly and and

432
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:10,530
the anomaly is his processed and

433
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:13,139
registered the event in hive hive

434
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:16,200
launches cortex and with the help of

435
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:18,630
special cortex plugin so it gets the

436
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:22,920
admins password goes to the machine I

437
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:25,200
want your scans cancer and then gets the

438
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:27,530
list of security logs additional

439
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:32,130
information for insulin formation which

440
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:35,520
goes into one place and this is done in

441
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:39,120
order to so we do one account which is

442
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:41,129
admin for all stations and what we're

443
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,989
trying to avoid that actually yeah

444
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:46,010
that's true but so but there are no

445
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:50,040
instruments finished products that would

446
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:52,860
our higher P systems so the incident

447
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:57,720
response platform but when we ask either

448
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:59,939
supported labs so they say they don't

449
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:03,679
give you the direct answer right and so

450
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,679
they serve developed systems yeah

451
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:11,169
and so then opens it's not open source

452
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:16,760
so there was a reference to the website

453
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:20,360
that there was a link you can ask a

454
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:23,149
question you can write to us that was a

455
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:26,449
link to the website and directly at the

456
00:24:23,149 --> 00:24:29,239
website it has it and the plus extended

457
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:32,720
documentation how you can do how you can

458
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,430
cancel how you can use it yes we thank

459
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,769
you
