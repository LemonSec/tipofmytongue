1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:09,080
good afternoon ladies and gentlemen we

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:09,080
will start I'd like to apologize for

3
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:20,520
this lack of pause between these

4
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:25,979
sessions so our session is going to be

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:29,160
beautiful and named is perhaps a little

6
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:33,350
bit too general but many of the speakers

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:38,340
present here are very notable in the

8
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:49,079
digital and it's called from global

9
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:54,780
digitization to civilization so we are

10
00:00:49,079 --> 00:01:03,080
going to discuss digital is developing

11
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:12,390
what it gives us what yet what security

12
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:16,860
challenges it creates and more there is

13
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:21,600
good or bad at the end of the day we're

14
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:24,780
going to discuss the sociological poles

15
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,990
we know that people are quiet many

16
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,420
people are quite positive when it comes

17
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:34,770
to digitization I'd like to introduce to

18
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:38,670
you our speakers before we start our

19
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:42,000
discussions the are the best in their

20
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,380
respective spheres so perhaps on the

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,240
website

22
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:51,830
by the a meaningful information about

23
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:55,100
who is who even though we are quite know

24
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:59,070
people my name is Ruslan Makarov

25
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:01,649
president the founder of humanity for

26
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:04,830
the past 4 years I have created all

27
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:14,190
sorts of digital solutions for finance

28
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:23,810
security and so on we have two ladies

29
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:27,359
here galina's file who found iraq that

30
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:31,650
is involved in intellectual property and

31
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:35,580
many other related product projects we

32
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:38,510
have IP chain vice-president that is

33
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:44,840
also closely with intellectual property

34
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:49,890
protections and digital solutions

35
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:51,870
alexander bash mean that of the past 20

36
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:55,320
years has been involved in digital

37
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:58,880
solutions across the board mathematical

38
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:04,470
beautiful stories that have to do with

39
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:08,040
solutions to philosophical questions

40
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:12,690
related to where digitization is taking

41
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:14,910
us genius may receive an advisor on

42
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:18,450
branding and development encrypt the

43
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:24,170
police who is going to tell us a lot of

44
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:30,260
things about real problems real problems

45
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:34,048
between digital solutions and real

46
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:36,328
people here yeah okay from business

47
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:40,519

entrepreneurship and young businessman

50
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:54,769
he has a lot of knowledge related to how

51
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:57,220
startups get successful and we have

52
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,220

management and modern top guy on our

58
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:34,490
team

59
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:37,250
Nora know of what in Vermont Lincoln if

60
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:41,930
it's every security unit at Microsoft

61
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:44,449
and and he has a very deep knowledge he

62
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,580
has a lot of experience that he has

63
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:48,620
gained in different positions and he has

a lot of experience and understanding of

65
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:56,300
house current cybersecurity structured

66
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:58,099
what challenges it faces and what are

67
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,479
the relations between digital products

68
00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:05,930
and society

69
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:09,370
statistics show and it just happened so

70
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:15,530
happened over the past three years that

71
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:18,620
we are starting to try to figure out

72
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:22,030
what these numbers mean to us and these

73
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:25,270
numbers come from different different

74
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:28,969
sociological polling companies and

75
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:34,370
consulting companies so digitization in

76
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:37,780
Russia is really moving fast

77
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:39,770
and it's offering more and more new

78
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:42,289
possibilities and opportunities

79
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:45,080
PricewaterhouseCoopers recently and

80
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:51,020
McKinsey recently shown that by 2020 the

81
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:57,289
global market 14 percent of global

82
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:58,909
market well this number is this this

83
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:01,030
number may be different depending on

84
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:04,990
what consulting company it comes from

85
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:08,030
artificial intelligence will account for

86
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:11,180
14 percent of the global market so the

87
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:14,059
digital digital is really becoming more

88
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,610
and more mainstream and when people say

89
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,650
that Russia is a backward country and so

90
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:25,389
on so forth

91
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:27,979
according to zoom pulling service

92
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:33,680
sixty-two percent of the Russian

93
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:39,080
population actually use digital media

94
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:46,539
and 57 percent to use either internet or

95
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:52,510
other digital services so as digital

96
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:56,570
pessimists say Oh Digital skeptics say

97
00:06:52,510 --> 00:07:00,550
we can't say that there is a kind of a

98
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:04,969
standoff between digital and non-digital

99
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:10,570
and a few housekeeping remarks all of

100
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:15,160
the panelists will share their opinion

101
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:16,659
over ten minutes each and then we invite

102
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,730
the audience to participate in these

103
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,170
discussions I will try to moderate this

104
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:23,280
process perhaps I will be asking

105
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:28,780
questions of the panelists and try to

106
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:31,960
try to manage our discussion okay we'll

107
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:39,039
start with all examples this question is

108
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:43,359
very wide from the real digital values

109
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:46,120
to the philosophical understanding so is

110
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:51,820
it digital for humans or humans for the

111
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:54,790
digital good morning welcome everybody

112
00:07:51,820 --> 00:08:03,610
I'd like to say that the motto of our

113
00:07:54,790 --> 00:08:06,670
conference is breaking stereotypes so so

114
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:09,690
if you think that I don't have enough

115
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,690
respect for

116
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:20,370
trusted sources then don't be surprised

117
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:26,378
because this is quite in line with our

118
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:31,540
motto there may be maybe a slight

119
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:34,639
technical issue with the presentation

120
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,639
[Music]

121
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:48,340
okay my presentation has finally come on

122
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:57,460
I'm going to be as general as possible

123
00:08:48,340 --> 00:09:00,850
and not go to a foreign to details so IT

124
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:05,830
is becoming a general purpose technology

125
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:11,820
at just like electricity and others and

126
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:18,580
IT is going along the same path the

127
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:23,950
power of digital has grown to immense

128
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:25,720
proportions aggregators are break in the

129
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:31,740
investment plans of traditional

130
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:31,740
capitalism globalization is leading to

131
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,190
the

132
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:45,860
is leading us to a time when unqualified

133
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:50,209
or unskilled jobs will no longer be

134
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:55,280
needed and also we have a conceptual

135
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:58,820
paradigm shift so we are moving from the

136
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:14,720
management by hierarchy to a management

137
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:19,700
or networked management this slide shows

138
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:24,500
the technologies that are buzzwords

139
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:35,570
these days and we keep hearing about

140
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:38,960
them from every quarter digital form of

141
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:43,790
data is the main hallmark of the digital

142
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:46,670
economy but digital data is a necessary

143
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:50,750
but not a sufficient condition of the

144
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:57,219
digital economy so a computer should be

145
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:57,220
able to interpret the data that is

146
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:05,720
presenter so the technologies can the

147
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:08,000
roughly split into two categories those

148
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:13,430
that create the hyper connectivity of

149
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:18,200
data such as where we pay such as where

150
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:21,859
we're going and the Internet of Things

151
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:25,180
is here and then the hyper convergence

152
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:31,810
of theta will become more and more

153
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:34,120
visible so 5g ipv6 are the technical

154
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:40,760
technical drive requisites for

155
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:45,290
hyperconvergence big data and at the top

156
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:50,390
of this hierarchy we have AI VR AR and

157
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:53,870
digital twin so these technologies these

158
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:56,420
technologies will benefit more and more

159
00:11:53,870 --> 00:12:00,290
from hyperconvergence since we are

160
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:05,779
trying to fight or combat stereotypes

161
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:07,939
I'd like to review what we hear in the

162
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:11,510
international fora there's a lot of talk

163
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:15,140
about industry 4.0

164
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:17,920
which is which is a re-patch of industry

165
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,920
3.0

166
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:28,610
in the previous industry industry 11 the

167
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:32,120
key or machines it's not the case

168
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:36,070
anymore so digitization is the key in

169
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:38,120
now so here we need a synchronous

170
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:42,440
transformation of not only production

171
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:45,019
manufacturing but also society and the

172
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:49,449
legal system otherwise we're gonna have

173
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:52,760
a management gap so what if I have here

174
00:12:49,449 --> 00:13:00,740
the Chinese experience Europe Social

175
00:12:52,760 --> 00:13:06,230
Credit here and they started to build an

176
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:08,750
economy in the old paradigm and if you

177
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:12,459
don't shift the paradigm then you are

178
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:16,940
not going to achieve a successful

179
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:21,949
digitization of digitization of the

180
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:25,610
legal system is still like very much and

181
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:29,709
it may not be feasible at all so what is

182
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,709
being done I don't mind but

183
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:41,300
it looks like a digital gadget in so it

184
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:46,819
is Troy we may just end up and

185
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:49,370
destroying the existing laws so this

186
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:52,269
approach cannot be called a systemic

187
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,269
approach and

188
00:14:00,689 --> 00:14:11,680
Russia is trailing the West we are

189
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:14,258
trying to catch up with the Western so

190
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:22,388
we are not going to achieve any

191
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:24,790
breakthrough if we if we just want to

192
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:26,889
increase our GDP and to get slightly

193
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:30,430
ahead of the market and then know we

194
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:35,769
need to be we need to act more

195
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:37,748
courageously we need to be bolder so we

196
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:39,850
don't need to build a system that

197
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:45,809
creates something good but we need to

198
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:48,730
build a system that will that will

199
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:52,540
motivate the creation of intellectual

200
00:14:48,730 --> 00:15:02,110
property and that's going to be a the

201
00:14:52,540 --> 00:15:07,120
solution and I'd like to according to

202
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:09,220
BBC and Karl Marx was the first thinker

203
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,370
of the 20th century although it was born

204
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:15,449
he was born in the 19th century he

205
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:18,790
proposed that he proposed this model

206
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:21,250
commodity money commodity but it should

207
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:23,790
be transformed into ammonia commodity

208
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,790
money

209
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:35,989
so I'd like to sort of remember jeremy

210
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:39,980
rifkin he said that that the social

211
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:43,790
hierarchy will become flat horizontal in

212
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:47,180
I don't believe that given the size of

213
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:48,980
the Russian Federation it is unlikely so

214
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:51,620
I believe that the hierarchy should be

215
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:59,509
based on the competences of a person and

216
00:15:51,620 --> 00:16:01,370
I believe that the social ranking should

217
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:03,949
be taken into ecology and it's not a

218
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:08,360
coincidence that people talking about a

219
00:16:03,949 --> 00:16:11,990
social lifts and in a dynamic

220
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:18,889
hierarchical these lifts should not only

221
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:21,470
go up but it should also go down so you

222
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:27,250
can move along the social hierarchy both

223
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:27,250
up and down also what I'd like to say

224
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:36,709
institutional traps are when people work

225
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:41,089
in efficiently but they don't change

226
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:43,880
anything because everybody is satisfied

227
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:49,300
with over the situation hyperconvergence

228
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:52,420
of course changes this there is a lot of

229
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,420
there is

230
00:16:54,070 --> 00:17:01,720
people want fairness people want justice

231
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:07,209
and this was last year this was one of

232
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:09,069
the most popular requests and also needs

233
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:11,770
to be uncertainty without uncertainty

234
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:15,720
yet the capitalist model fails this has

235
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:21,929
become more relevant

236
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:31,809
there are even profitless manufacturing

237
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:34,210
America so institutional traps so

238
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:36,790
institutional traps are relevant and

239
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:39,070
they can be dealt with through a

240
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:42,240
professional knowledge so I encourage

241
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:48,399
everybody to participate in this

242
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:50,620
discussion and our our digital formation

243
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,380
to organization has many specialists

244
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:56,559
mathematicians and others that could be

245
00:17:53,380 --> 00:18:01,809
in your point of view today because

246
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:04,540
humans generate digits digits get

247
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:08,230
converted into services providing for

248
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:12,040
human able so you get this chain human

249
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:13,750
digit human well that's exactly why I

250
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,879
put the question they say I don't have

251
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,500
already made recipes I don't think

252
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,559
anybody has them because of those

253
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:24,490
transformations the digital gives you

254
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:27,940
don't get fully get your brain well it

255
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:33,070
is believed and almost all social

256
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:36,190
researchers say that that currently we

257
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:40,780
only start to getting into the research

258
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:43,210
of digital impact on humans I agree with

259
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:47,500
that there are lots of aspects risk

260
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:50,230
related aspects for instance the

261
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:53,890
compatibility issues the first day

262
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:56,170
research who is compatible with home and

263
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:58,780
and they start using you as an organ

264
00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:02,020
donor or lastly and we're all people

265
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:03,700
well humans here and then we start

266
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:08,280
discussing him thank you thanks a lot

267
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:13,180
Alexander we'll continue talking and

268
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:16,750
this be a segue to an absolutely

269
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:20,140
specific parts we have Galina don't

270
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:23,080
recover the fount of our ego a person

271
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:30,550
who knows about 80 security more than

272
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:33,189
anybody else a doctor of law she has all

273
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:37,600
the information about the tools and how

274
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:39,460
they used in day-to-day lives well

275
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:44,020
actually I'd like to start with

276
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:47,140
intelligence because all the wealth of

277
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:49,510
human world is created by the power of

278
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:52,840
human intelligence and it's the

279
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:54,670
intelligence that determines our results

280
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:58,360
and outcomes including in the digital

281
00:19:54,670 --> 00:20:03,370
world the things that we create are

282
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:09,360
intellectual property and it is on the

283
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:09,360
behavior companies and humans that

284
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:18,010
depends whether this will be wealth

285
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:21,550
generated oh it will be stolen

286
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:24,610
because intelligence is not is integral

287
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:28,659
to human base a to human personality

288
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:31,929
it's on this that will the results of

289
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:35,320
our economy and society will rely so

290
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:37,570
therefore the value of a modern company

291
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:41,110
is a determined by the form of

292
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:42,879
monopolies that a person has created and

293
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:45,209
because we don't have anything to start

294
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,820
with other than intelligence then all

295
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:50,650
the work and wealth of our life is

296
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:54,070
gained through intelligence

297
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:56,500
so therefore intellectual property

298
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:59,889
is a form of legal monopoly that's

299
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,690
available to us that we can use if we

300
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:04,030
have formalized it in the correct way

301
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:07,360
and numbers speak for themselves

302
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:10,750
a lot of money is being spent by

303
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:13,060
companies to reward their intelligent

304
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:16,150
employees that and these are specialists

305
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:18,399
professionals who create the Intel

306
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:22,500
intellectual property of the company

307
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:28,270
it's a software data design text

308
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:30,910
customer databases a lot of data analog

309
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:32,740
with digital doesn't matter they

310
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:35,440
constitute the intellectual property of

311
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,480
a company and in this connection I have

312
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,310
a question so we spent the money paid

313
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:43,690
for the development or spend the time

314
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:47,790
what to do with it next how the outcome

315
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:51,780
of our actions our efforts imagination

316
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:56,290
can turn into something tangible to

317
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:58,860
become an asset the most successful

318
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:04,120
companies of the world know how it works

319
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:06,250
more most of their wealth is Intel their

320
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:10,929
IP doesn't matter what it is it's

321
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:20,260
Microsoft software it's Amazon websites

322
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:24,250
or resources it's alphabets assets the

323
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:27,670
structure of IP looks like this in a

324
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:31,840
picture of the world the intellectual

325
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:34,660
property tends to be as a patent as a

326
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:38,020
result of engineering work we believe

327
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:41,350
that if there's no patent no evidence or

328
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:43,960
some device it looks like there's no IP

329
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:46,659
generated no the effort that we prepared

330
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:49,610
to as we spent to prepare an analytical

331
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:53,280
report data collections the structuring

332
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:56,520
templates developing advertising

333
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,320
concepts design they don't seem to be to

334
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,918
cost anything because you can't get a

335
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:05,299
patent for them but if we take closer

336
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:10,880
look then about 70% of everything

337
00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:14,668
created by a company objects of

338
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:18,000
copyright so they their costs their

339
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:20,400
volume can be accounted for and you

340
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,260
don't need to get a patent for it and

341
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:29,150
also patents account but better

342
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:32,520
protected items accounts for about 10%

343
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:36,110
know how accounts for about 20% these

344
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:42,480
are processes and knowledge that

345
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:44,840
comprises commercial secrets they

346
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:49,289
provide for the competitive advantage

347
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:53,340
that don't need to be disclosed to the

348
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:55,230
markets as opposed to what happens with

349
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:58,500
a patent and because intellectual

350
00:23:55,230 --> 00:24:02,850
property and copyright are the results

351
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:07,409
of applying our intelligent intelligence

352
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:11,730
then these rights belong to those people

353
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:15,570
who created them it makes sense this

354
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:16,799
right is generated at the moment of

355
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:19,980
creating the value

356
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,990
it's the copyright the right to the name

357
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,330
the right to protection against

358
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:29,400
distortion so if a we're a company and

359
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:32,220
we haven't made sure that we've gained

360
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:34,710
those rights it means that they don't

361
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:37,010
belong to us for a company it means that

362
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:40,230
all the money that that have been spent

363
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:41,590
as shown in the previous slides could be

364
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:44,740
written off

365
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:46,870
as expense we haven't got either

366
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:49,270
intellectual property or an asset or

367
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:51,309
something that we could sell or

368
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:55,330
something that who can license so we

369
00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:59,100
could account for as part of our capital

370
00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:04,270
it looks like we're going to lose it so

371
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:08,080
therefore we've explored the market

372
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:12,789
practices and trying to find ways how

373
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:18,210
you can avoid this not making great

374
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:22,470
efforts to formalise to create documents

375
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:26,230
to use the lawyers we tried to create

376
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:28,330
automation solutions and we've had

377
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:28,929
experience implementing it in Russian

378
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:33,399
companies

379
00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:37,149
it's about registering the copyright in

380
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:44,860
the day to day modes along with the

381
00:25:37,149 --> 00:25:48,750
creation and now we can protect this

382
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:54,779
rights by recording the generation of

383
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:57,700
the values and linking it to the company

384
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:59,860
generating the evidence it works in a

385
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:04,779
single user version where the header

386
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:07,928
company wants to do it alone or if it's

387
00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:10,860
about a small start-up it also works in

388
00:26:07,929 --> 00:26:14,020
a multi-user mode which allows

389
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:17,428
connecting editing sending links instead

390
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:20,918
of sending documents over email to

391
00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:22,690
patent solicitors and lawyers and do it

392
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:25,480
within the protective protected

393
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:27,909
perimeter of the company and this is

394
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:32,580
what the system allows you to select

395
00:26:27,909 --> 00:26:37,320
when we defined what we are going to

396
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:42,490
look at as a result of our work we

397
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:44,060
select between the duration of

398
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:50,650
protection

399
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:56,000
we mark the needs to pay government fees

400
00:26:50,650 --> 00:27:00,860
the need to formalize certain documents

401
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:04,010
what requires documentary protection you

402
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:07,429
better do that like if you have drawings

403
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:10,600
and specific document certifying the

404
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:14,480
efforts that you've that you've made is

405
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:18,500
make it makes sense to create such

406
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:22,610
documents just take a look at the

407
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:25,070
results that you are achieving and see

408
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:26,899
what you can protect without necessarily

409
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:37,550
going to patterns we have it as a

410
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:43,610
question well go a question today is it

411
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:47,180
possible to transact this intellectual

412
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:50,120
property from a Russian jurisdiction to

413
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:53,300
other jurisdiction does this digital

414
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:56,439
form of evidence allow you solving this

415
00:27:53,300 --> 00:28:00,260
these problems yes the specificity of

416
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:04,880
copyright law is that opposed to patents

417
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:09,440
and trademarks it goes across borders so

418
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:12,410
your outcomes that are protected in one

419
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,640
country are protectable in all other

420
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:17,210
countries according to the Berne

421
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:20,450
Convention it means that we can use it

422
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:23,720
to block counterfeit products on

423
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:27,260
Aliexpress or pirate contents on Amazon

424
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:29,180
the market accepts this so this is the

425
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:34,900
tool that you can use quite often

426
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:37,760
Russian companies stop themselves from

427
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:39,680
getting protection because they think

428
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,180
that if they've got you haven't got

429
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,670
protection a certain territory they

430
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:45,800
can't work their copyright the copyright

431
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:47,570
concept allows you to go across these

432
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:51,139
boundaries of course in certain case

433
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:54,649
you'll need to have the documents

434
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:58,640
translated but in any event in it's

435
00:28:54,650 --> 00:29:00,410
going to be than getting a patent in a

436
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,270
specific country well thank you very

437
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:08,480
much and now we're getting to expand

438
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:11,030
this topic through the intelligent

439
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:15,650
experience for the realistic unifrom IP

440
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:19,370
chains and i would like to start with

441
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:21,680
the opinions that people have that the

442
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:27,379
society being changed in the 21st

443
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:30,910
century is just as it has been discussed

444
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,910
such a day that we have a lot of

445
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:37,670
workplaces going away because the

446
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:42,639
digital process is getting the way of

447
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:45,560
many processes so the the idea is that

448
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:48,380
intellectual property is going to become

449
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:51,770
the main commodity in the 21st century

450
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:53,990
is it really happens happening good

451
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:54,800
afternoon colleagues valaria thank you

452
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:59,060
very much

453
00:29:54,800 --> 00:30:01,300
you have given a very exciting

454
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:05,240
presentation of intellectual property

455
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:07,850
yes indeed they were living in a day and

456
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:10,400
age when a flexible property is getting

457
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:14,389
to the next level some people call it

458
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:16,400
the new oil they predict great future

459
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:20,210
for it but let's think about it so what

460
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:22,370
we're creating human capital is based on

461
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:25,460
the intelligent property and what we've

462
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:26,330
been observing in the markets in the

463
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:29,030
past few years

464
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:33,639
can I get my presentations on no this is

465
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:33,639
not my - IP chain

466
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:39,850
girlies ralina did you send my

467
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:46,790
presentation Gallina yes

468
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:49,250
can you help well while they do this

469
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:53,780
have something to discuss so it appears

470
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:59,690
that today this world model established

471
00:30:53,780 --> 00:31:02,420
in the 20th century as the lone interest

472
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:04,970
it brought the humanity in a dead end

473
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:06,830
where we find ourselves today so

474
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:10,010
intellectual property and that's an

475
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:12,199
opinion of a huge number of advanced

476
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:17,360
economies including Benin and Piketty

477
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:19,460
and mr. cousin so it's a consensus thing

478
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,080
that is the IT intellectual property and

479
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,940
this going to drive the planet looking

480
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:25,939
forward yes exactly

481
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:28,730
this was my idea over the past few years

482
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:31,160
Russian has been growing the export of

483
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:32,960
all those products that are not measured

484
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:36,290
in barrels are tones or something like

485
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:40,240
that I'm talking about IP the product of

486
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:43,310
creative industries including software

487
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:47,830
technologies we are reality movies

488
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:50,690
animations TV series all the variety of

489
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:55,280
IP products that exists and talking

490
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:58,730
globally about the world the trayless

491
00:31:55,280 --> 00:32:02,000
trend seems to encompass the world and

492
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:06,380
the share of IP in exports is huge in

493
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,930
China it's in excess of 30% in Germany

494
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:11,240
it's about 8% so we're also growing and

495
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:13,850
it's very important to understand this

496
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,410
nice thing to know but actually there

497
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:20,990
are quite a lot of problems in the IP

498
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:26,210
market and when we're saying that we are

499
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:29,570
transferring from some real world to non

500
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:31,940
material world it's it's like it was in

501
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:34,850
the Wild West times it's the fittest and

502
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:37,030
it survives actually there's a crisis of

503
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:39,379
trust that people have been discussing

504
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:40,700
very much recently

505
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:44,000
meaning that

506
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:46,700
some other mechanisms need to be created

507
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,790
so that any person creating IP could

508
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:54,950
effectively manage it and it's about

509
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:57,830
protecting IP it's about controlling

510
00:32:54,950 --> 00:33:01,160
unauthorized usage and actually we've

511
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:07,179
all been observing a situation of the

512
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:11,230
past year when IP owners denounced

513
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:16,370
search engines like Google as pirates

514
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:19,070
and when memo was assigned last year now

515
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:21,739
a draft law is being prepared so it's

516
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:23,899
often the fact that IP needs protection

517
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:25,310
it needs other mechanisms to get

518
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,230
protected actually they trust

519
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:32,270
infrastructure that we're building an IP

520
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:33,610
chain is actually there to replace the

521
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:37,100
old archaic

522
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:39,620
services by something he knew that

523
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:42,379
people want because what's happening in

524
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:45,020
the Union well a member of the Union

525
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:50,030
components comes to us and says I was

526
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:53,150
selling my music at some marketplace for

527
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:56,360
1.5 dollars and as a result I heard it

528
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:59,270
in Australia in an advert so the world

529
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:01,639
has become global he's now trying to get

530
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:04,100
lawyers involved to get some money from

531
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:06,590
that but what's it's about is that

532
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:09,770
technologies are so deeply entrenched in

533
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:11,929
that it lies that the borders have gone

534
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:14,090
away where's my presentation actually

535
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:16,100
don't quite sound like presentation I

536
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:18,560
normally have one or two slides I just

537
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:22,009
wanted to show you something important

538
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:25,239
to you but never mind so what we've done

539
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:30,440
well we've tried to ask a question of

540
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:32,089
what IP products on the market we even

541
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,330
ordered the research from Baker &

542
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:38,750
McKenzie because if anybody of you have

543
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:43,029
looked into the Civic code the list of

544
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:47,270
IP products is very limited there are no

545
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:49,490
3d 3d objects are not even mentioned but

546
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:54,219
whatever they said a lot of products

547
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:58,509
appeared such as sports logos really

548
00:34:54,219 --> 00:35:01,379
social media profiles biometric data

549
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:04,570
these are different types of

550
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:06,190
intellectual property that rotated the

551
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:08,590
market you in today so we tried to

552
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:10,600
create such a model of the IP market

553
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:12,820
that could work not only with the

554
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:16,390
existing objects but with the new ones

555
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:18,640
as well so what we got a five-tier model

556
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:22,930
I would really love to see a slide now

557
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:28,120
and now back to biometrics human

558
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:33,339
biometric if it's now part of IP yes

559
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:37,710
indeed it's part of IP so PII that have

560
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:40,600
been hacked by someone could be regarded

561
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:42,610
as an infringement on intellectual

562
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,740
property and of the author yes of course

563
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:47,620
a lot of attention is being paid to the

564
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:49,950
protection of personal data it is G dpi

565
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:52,270
in Europe but we also have our own laws

566
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:54,640
it's become very difficult to work for

567
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:57,730
the personal data now I think any one of

568
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,890
you just to get a pass

569
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:03,550
issued to them to get to some

570
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:05,920
organization needs to sign a personal

571
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:08,590
data I would really love to have a slide

572
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:12,310
right now well let me in the meantime

573
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:14,050
let me give you the prerequisites how we

574
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:15,970
were creating there the market

575
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:17,680
architecture we analyzed the experience

576
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:19,419
in different countries and I'm going to

577
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,339
tell you about how it looks in different

578
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:22,690
countries how they work with

579
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:24,790
intellectual property and what

580
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:26,530
applications they have what solutions

581
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:29,050
are available so based on the platform

582
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:32,790
economy we created a five tier

583
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:36,010
architecture now relying on the

584
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:38,020
legislative level because we all live

585
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:40,270
below the next level is infrastructure

586
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:43,210
it allows bringing together all the

587
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:47,280
markets members building some

588
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:51,440
universally applicable products the next

589
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:53,570
level is platform level where the

590
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,070
exist solutions that love bringing

591
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:59,030
together market participants without

592
00:36:55,070 --> 00:37:01,670
intermediaries so there are copyright

593
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:04,660
owners in one country in another country

594
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:08,360
there are users and so they can meet

595
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:11,480
each other at this platform the next

596
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:15,050
level up includes ecosystem solutions

597
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:18,170
that on the one hand provide b2c

598
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:20,330
solutions to other participants on the

599
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:23,570
other hands they're also focused on

600
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:26,060
solving the issues of the participants

601
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:29,090
in the system and the top level is

602
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:35,870
business solutions level where b2b and

603
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:38,450
b2c solutions exist that address

604
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:42,950
specific tasks of the market positions

605
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:45,379
of colleagues maybe I will just I do

606
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:48,770
need to show how it works

607
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:50,660
well actually we can replace your the

608
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:57,200
speaker for some time ok ok they're not

609
00:37:50,660 --> 00:38:03,040
starting it that's great if they in fact

610
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:06,980
we really have a lot of questions going

611
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:10,040
digital do you get or the information

612
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:14,180
gets dehumanized and then as we start

613
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:17,509
using it then it gets humanized so in

614
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:22,129
this situation the question is how well

615
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:25,400
the legal environment allows you using

616
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:28,220
your own intellectual property nothing

617
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:30,950
stands in the way and absolutely

618
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:34,129
confident to say that there are no legal

619
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:36,890
limitations to manage your intellectual

620
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:38,720
property but with the sales with sales

621
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:42,109
it's absolutely difficult but there are

622
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:44,120
some restrictions they don't stand in

623
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:46,700
the way for sales that just make the

624
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,930
process a bit more difficult but what

625
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:50,120
I'm talking about is that because

626
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:54,830
there's so much intellectual property we

627
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:57,710
tried to measure the number at least at

628
00:38:54,830 --> 00:39:00,020
least 65 million musical items iTunes

629
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:03,410
less videos but at least we're talking

630
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:04,859
about hundreds of thousands of items so

631
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:06,480
it's obvious that

632
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:08,069
so you won't be able to manage it

633
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,220
without specific solutions to be an

634
00:39:08,069 --> 00:39:14,609
effective owner to effectively protect

635
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:17,249
it monetize it and so on so forth to

636
00:39:14,609 --> 00:39:18,390
work with the intellectual property you

637
00:39:17,249 --> 00:39:21,238
can only do it with the help of

638
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:26,460
technology so goodwill plays a part in

639
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:28,319
this situation so when we are using a

640
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:30,480
certain platform based solutions can we

641
00:39:28,319 --> 00:39:32,700
use this platform solutions to implement

642
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:37,160
our goodwill no doubt about that that's

643
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:40,078
exactly what we're doing we allow

644
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:43,999
implement such sophisticated products as

645
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:47,579
goodwill okay let me start explaining if

646
00:39:43,999 --> 00:39:50,339
I'm still helping that they will switch

647
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:53,369
on the presentation the base level that

648
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:57,299
I was talking about it's a universal

649
00:39:53,369 --> 00:40:00,809
structure for the interaction with the

650
00:39:57,299 --> 00:40:09,390
market of Mississippi chain it's a

651
00:40:00,809 --> 00:40:12,150
distributed ledger that is used by all

652
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:14,430
market participants both in Russia so

653
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:17,940
based on the IP chain infrastructure all

654
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:20,009
the different services implemented this

655
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:22,289
different tasks for instance at the

656
00:40:20,009 --> 00:40:25,049
platform level visitin I picks a service

657
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:26,849
I pick service allows you execute in a

658
00:40:25,049 --> 00:40:31,309
simple transaction over the flexion per

659
00:40:26,849 --> 00:40:33,930
player such as a licensing purchasing

660
00:40:31,309 --> 00:40:37,319
the one thing that it should be able to

661
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:40,440
work with any types of items any types

662
00:40:37,319 --> 00:40:44,640
of use any types of rights any types of

663
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:47,989
conditions that the parties should agree

664
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:50,400
on the next solution that exists of the

665
00:40:47,989 --> 00:40:53,009
platform level it's coffee this crud

666
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:59,180
investment platform that allows owners

667
00:40:53,009 --> 00:40:59,180
right owners to get security

668
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:10,169
to get lower to get loans with IP our

669
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:15,210
user security so if the money is not

670
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:17,250
repaid then the lender will get rights

671
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:20,280
on the intellectual property in the next

672
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:22,080
level as the reservations entries which

673
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:26,570
already exist in the market this is the

674
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:31,560
solution that allows depositing

675
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:36,120
intellectual property items protections

676
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:37,920
with keys private keys one of being

677
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:42,150
stolen cocoa for instance another at the

678
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:45,810
IP owner also you can deposit know how

679
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:47,310
items so that none nobody else rather

680
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:49,770
than the right owner would have access

681
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:51,540
to it and so if your rights a business

682
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:55,710
print upon for instance somebody stole

683
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:57,630
your IP or try to reproduce your

684
00:41:55,710 --> 00:42:02,580
know-how a process you will have

685
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:06,590
evidence that the IP court will accept

686
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:10,259
another participants IP in this IP chain

687
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:14,340
environment so that in real time while

688
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:16,980
the court case has been examined they

689
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:19,650
can see the real life status of what's

690
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:21,960
happening with the IP item and who is

691
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:24,180
the owner another breakthrough service

692
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,980
that Andres has allowing protecting

693
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:28,859
other intellectual property is called

694
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:33,330
anti-piracy it's a solution that laws

695
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:36,140
are fighting unauthorized use of IP

696
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:39,600
items in the Internet to work with a V

697
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:43,040
you know music videos anything else

698
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:47,790
texts pictures and music how it works

699
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:49,740
there's a crawler that can look for

700
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:52,529
information in any search engine any

701
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:56,129
streaming services route you beauty of

702
00:42:52,530 --> 00:43:00,750
the contact on the class Nick gigantic

703
00:42:56,130 --> 00:43:03,990
so Google after its found by through

704
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:06,720
creating a tag clouds this is the way

705
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:10,200
how they use the most popular request

706
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:11,939
Aitken check if there are physical units

707
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,348
of the content and after the

708
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:16,140
verification

709
00:43:13,349 --> 00:43:18,029
the hosting providers generated with a

710
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:21,058
requester to remove this content after

711
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:23,009
that the crawler will come back check of

712
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:25,140
the content believe it and see if it

713
00:43:23,009 --> 00:43:25,559
hasn't sent a letter to the governing

714
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,700
body

715
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:29,759
what's the unity of this technology

716
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:32,430
firstly it is a unique Russian develop

717
00:43:29,759 --> 00:43:34,470
technology another Russian all other

718
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:38,339
countries have it as yet at least we

719
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:40,859
could see for instance such players as a

720
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:43,759
group IV that is actively playing in

721
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:47,609
this market they work exclusively with

722
00:43:43,759 --> 00:43:49,440
search requests and entry solution that

723
00:43:47,609 --> 00:43:51,239
went another step forward what's

724
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:55,410
important it makes no difference for

725
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:58,109
entries how many IP items it has to work

726
00:43:55,410 --> 00:44:01,589
with because in neuro networks work

727
00:43:58,109 --> 00:44:05,220
algorithmic search algorithms

728
00:44:01,589 --> 00:44:08,308
well engines work so we can protect any

729
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:11,609
number of content items in the network

730
00:44:08,309 --> 00:44:17,549
regardless of whether in Russia or other

731
00:44:11,609 --> 00:44:19,859
countries they reside also others this

732
00:44:17,549 --> 00:44:23,759
delivery until the data marts that

733
00:44:19,859 --> 00:44:26,219
allows the owner to effectively manage

734
00:44:23,759 --> 00:44:28,859
the content the next solution is called

735
00:44:26,219 --> 00:44:34,019
IP value that allows assessing

736
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:37,589
evaluating any IP item there's there are

737
00:44:34,019 --> 00:44:39,899
also remediation services called dispute

738
00:44:37,589 --> 00:44:41,489
man and at the very top of the business

739
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:43,799
application that their inventions and

740
00:44:41,489 --> 00:44:46,979
there are such solutions so that's also

741
00:44:43,799 --> 00:44:52,319
run today such as on online patent that

742
00:44:46,979 --> 00:44:56,700
allows registering any IP any item like

743
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:58,890
trademark ownership for items or phone

744
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:01,410
mixed solution that allows the right

745
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:03,839
owner to load that upload the content it

746
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:06,839
provided to an unlimited number let's

747
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:13,670
say restaurants bars stores shopping

748
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:13,670
malls to use in

749
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:22,760
for instance if it's a music item if you

750
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:25,460
come to Russia a IP ownership

751
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:28,910
organization which an IP chain node and

752
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:31,250
they will record this IP this music in

753
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:34,430
the IP chain and then they can

754
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:38,570
automatically get statistic on playing

755
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:41,779
back this music in all restaurants and

756
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:44,810
bars and so you know shopping malls so

757
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:47,150
this information gets to the right owner

758
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:50,150
so they can understand how much loyalty

759
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:52,460
they need to could forget and also the

760
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:54,320
information gets to the controlling

761
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:55,880
bodies what's important to mention

762
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:59,030
comparing Russia is the rest of the

763
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:00,890
world we've researched markets in all

764
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:05,990
sorts of countries America Asia

765
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:07,850
Singapore Hong Kong Europe CIS we've had

766
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:09,649
lots of conversations with lots of

767
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:11,740
people at different levels at the level

768
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:16,190
of governments and the level of

769
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:21,020
ministries and agencies dealing with

770
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:25,460
intellectual property and we made a very

771
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:26,930
important conclusion unfortunately well

772
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:28,820
I haven't been able to show you the

773
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:31,069
presentation but the infrastructure

774
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:33,830
level that exists in Russia which is IP

775
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:36,950
chain it doesn't exist anywhere in the

776
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:39,230
world I mean the level that would bring

777
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:40,910
all the market participants together and

778
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:43,070
another specificity about the Russian

779
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:47,990
market that there are a lot of solutions

780
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:49,910
here either in R&D or in a test and

781
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:52,220
product by phase if we really launched

782
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:56,390
it all to the markets we have a serious

783
00:46:52,220 --> 00:47:00,439
chance to become I don't know advanced

784
00:46:56,390 --> 00:47:04,129
country in International Property

785
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:07,760
Management so this is the future that we

786
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:11,210
are striving for and going to actually

787
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:15,650
we have Viktor Stepanovitch in xed who

788
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:19,850
is one of the members in the State Duma

789
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:20,859
expert council including regarding the

790
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:25,140
questions

791
00:47:20,859 --> 00:47:28,150
about the future of a digital economy so

792
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:31,270
it's a pity we haven't seen Valerius

793
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:32,710
presentation but everything it is a good

794
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:36,190
time so I think we'll have an

795
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:40,180
opportunity Viktor reading cool is I'm

796
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:42,339
not gonna have a presentation I'm not

797
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:45,190
going to present any specific product

798
00:47:42,339 --> 00:47:48,430
but I would like to perhaps have a

799
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:52,690
discussion here and before I start I'd

800
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:54,970
like to know who I'm talking to

801
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:58,539
yes to optimize our discussions raise

802
00:47:54,970 --> 00:48:01,750
your hand if you are a business owner

803
00:47:58,539 --> 00:48:04,779
let's say an owner of an IT start-up or

804
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:09,400
something raise your hand if you work

805
00:48:04,779 --> 00:48:12,700
for a large IT company ok medium

806
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:14,200
business raise your hands Russian or

807
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:16,808
international okay raise your hand if

808
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:18,669
you represent a of Russian company ok

809
00:48:16,809 --> 00:48:20,980
all the others represent an

810
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:23,410
international company ok

811
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:27,039
perhaps not everybody is from the IT

812
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:29,859
industry so my colleagues and myself

813
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:32,950
will work with a large Russian companies

814
00:48:29,859 --> 00:48:36,520
such as a civil right II just recently

815
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:41,078
in Tomsk er we conducted for gas purring

816
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:43,720
Bank a kind of a workshop about the

817
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:47,410
development of voice assistance we also

818
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:50,578
work with startups we have launched an

819
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:54,029
accelerator on the platform of the

820
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:57,750
Moscow suit of physics and technology

821
00:48:54,030 --> 00:49:00,090
and we're developing some projects in

822
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:03,030
Russia but we're also considering

823
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:05,430
opening such an accelerator in China we

824
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:11,750
have noticed that there are some

825
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:16,710
standard errors that people tend to make

826
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:20,640
and these errors do influence the

827
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:23,370
results that they get this has to do

828
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:25,980
with some existential skills that people

829
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:29,210
have unfortunately the educational

830
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:33,540
system is very antic is antiquated

831
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:35,280
I can tell you from experience I can say

832
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:38,150
this with experience because I have

833
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:41,130
worked at the Ministry of Education

834
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:45,780
unfortunately unfortunately there is not

835
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:50,460
enough skilled people and so on the

836
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:54,390
education system as it is now is very

837
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:57,890
unflexible is very inflexible I'd also

838
00:49:54,390 --> 00:50:08,250
like to remind you that Aristotle

839
00:49:57,890 --> 00:50:11,640
several years before Christ said for

840
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:15,600
some some weird discussions even about

841
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:19,950
the number of teeth so what I'm what I

842
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:25,350
would like to say is that our society is

843
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:28,879
quite rigid it lives by certain

844
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:31,730
stereotypes that are entrenched in our

845
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:36,840
[Music]

846
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:39,750
society in our mind and there are a lot

847
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:44,150
of discussions that the previous

848
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:48,330
education model are based on hard skills

849
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:52,520
such as coding and decoding skill good

850
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:56,078
writing skill the skill that you need to

851
00:50:52,520 --> 00:51:01,809
drive nails into a piece of wood

852
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:04,390
and these also are matched with soft

853
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:10,239
skills and they became more and more

854
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:11,920
popular Putin also mentioned the need to

855
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:14,140
develop not only hard skills but also

856
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:20,229
soft skills but people are moving away

857
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:23,910
from this paradigm people are moving

858
00:51:20,229 --> 00:51:29,259
more and more towards a new model that

859
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:33,459
has three prongs for example you may

860
00:51:29,259 --> 00:51:34,660
need one skill today but this factor may

861
00:51:33,459 --> 00:51:37,598
actually stop you from developing

862
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:43,209
tomorrow they may have a skill of

863
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:45,609
writing reading time management these

864
00:51:43,209 --> 00:51:48,519
skills help us become effective to be

865
00:51:45,609 --> 00:51:53,259
effective and people very often lose

866
00:51:48,519 --> 00:51:57,069
sight and by the sight of the fact and

867
00:51:53,259 --> 00:52:01,239
the educational system misses this they

868
00:51:57,069 --> 00:52:04,390
have to be human centric services these

869
00:52:01,239 --> 00:52:06,999
we call existential skills the skills

870
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:10,420
that are needed throughout every

871
00:52:06,999 --> 00:52:14,109
person's life things like the ability to

872
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:16,119
self educate for example if you get one

873
00:52:14,109 --> 00:52:17,410
skill you may need it today but you may

874
00:52:16,119 --> 00:52:19,989
not need it tomorrow

875
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:22,180
this skill may actually put a break in

876
00:52:19,989 --> 00:52:24,999
your development tomorrow so you have to

877
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:29,049
be able to unlearn a skill when you

878
00:52:24,999 --> 00:52:31,558
don't need it anymore and since we're

879
00:52:29,049 --> 00:52:35,549
talking about IT here there are certain

880
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:41,069
psychological profiles and of people

881
00:52:35,549 --> 00:52:43,479
schizoid people these people have dense

882
00:52:41,069 --> 00:52:46,209
psychologists or aspect they like to dig

883
00:52:43,479 --> 00:52:47,589
deep they like to understand these

884
00:52:46,209 --> 00:52:50,259
people

885
00:52:47,589 --> 00:52:53,380
these people have the entire universe in

886
00:52:50,259 --> 00:52:55,420
their heads these people like to be

887
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:57,910
professors they mostly professors these

888
00:52:55,420 --> 00:53:02,559
people who like to really get to the

889
00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:04,029
bottom of things they like to code they

890
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:08,140
don't like to communicate they don't

891
00:53:04,029 --> 00:53:12,299
like to the only public speaking they

892
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:15,819
are demotivated by brainstorming

893
00:53:12,299 --> 00:53:19,660
sessions they don't like it that's a

894
00:53:15,819 --> 00:53:23,349
stressful factor for them so when we

895
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:27,549
talked to startup companies this has to

896
00:53:23,349 --> 00:53:30,759
be taken into account so we have to

897
00:53:27,549 --> 00:53:33,430
create carbon ecosystem that helps a

898
00:53:30,759 --> 00:53:40,630
person to identify what psychological

899
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:44,348
type he or she is and to develop where

900
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:48,539
that person lags behind take Elon Musk

901
00:53:44,349 --> 00:53:55,299
for example this person is schizoid

902
00:53:48,539 --> 00:54:00,670
paranoid but he got into an ecosystem

903
00:53:55,299 --> 00:54:03,219
where his qualities his qualities

904
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:07,119
actually helped him to get to where he

905
00:54:03,219 --> 00:54:10,439
is now so it's a question of being in

906
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:17,229
the right place in the right ecosystem

907
00:54:10,439 --> 00:54:19,449
so I believe this has to be a this is

908
00:54:17,229 --> 00:54:23,259
taken into account of in if you look at

909
00:54:19,449 --> 00:54:27,369
the Soviet School of skill development

910
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:30,880
let's look at what was done in design

911
00:54:27,369 --> 00:54:35,819
bureaus what they did in the early days

912
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:38,949
of the Soviet Union they just they just

913
00:54:35,819 --> 00:54:43,989
isolated scientists and engineers and

914
00:54:38,949 --> 00:54:45,180
then they just injected some dissin

915
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:48,809
formations

916
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:51,419
to the effect that in the West this or

917
00:54:48,809 --> 00:54:53,640
that technology you're working on is far

918
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:56,730
more developed so you're lagging behind

919
00:54:53,640 --> 00:55:02,038
you have to double down and that worked

920
00:54:56,730 --> 00:55:04,349
it's not working anymore now but there

921
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:10,559
are attempts to replicate this in other

922
00:55:04,349 --> 00:55:12,510
places in other quarters so this links

923
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:12,930
back to what I mentioned a few minutes

924
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:16,260
ago

925
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:21,390
the existential skills these existential

926
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:24,960
skills are extremely vital so we believe

927
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:29,190
that it is important give the

928
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:32,789
foundational qualities human centric

929
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:36,140
qualities and it's necessary to support

930
00:55:32,789 --> 00:55:39,690
and maintain these human centric

931
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:42,990
qualities by putting the people in the

932
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:45,839
right place so people have to be people

933
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:47,339
have to be taken care of in that respect

934
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:49,109
if you have any questions I'd be happy

935
00:55:47,339 --> 00:55:54,288
to take them okay we'll do questions

936
00:55:49,109 --> 00:55:59,220
later an important point you mentioned

937
00:55:54,289 --> 00:56:02,309
is that interaction is absolutely

938
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:04,529
essential for development of society and

939
00:56:02,309 --> 00:56:07,079
society is composed of different

940
00:56:04,529 --> 00:56:08,849
psychological types people with

941
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:17,460
different psychological types and I like

942
00:56:08,849 --> 00:56:19,529
that thought and also that is related to

943
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:22,710
I be convergent knowledge in fact

944
00:56:19,529 --> 00:56:25,380
creates completely different completely

945
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:27,510
different possibilities possibilities

946
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:30,710
that we didn't have before flooding or

947
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:30,710
making our next speaker

948
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:37,220
it's a lot of experience and even in the

949
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:38,420
Soviet Union when the system was

950
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:42,049
completely different but I would like

951
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:43,900
Latimer to ask to talk about to talk

952
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:50,210
about the interaction between the

953
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:57,650
ecosystem ecosystems of digital and the

954
00:56:50,210 --> 00:57:01,780
social ok I thought it was gonna be the

955
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:01,780
last to speak but no problem about this

956
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:09,410
I'd like to start by a well-known phrase

957
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:14,779
I don't remember who is the author of

958
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:16,190
this phrase we can google it the phrase

959
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:19,090
goes as follows

960
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:22,040
the circle of these people is extremely

961
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:24,080
narrow and they are very far from the

962
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:27,440
people okay when we are talking about

963
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:30,290
digital information revolution IT

964
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:33,020
security how these things are going to

965
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:36,770
affect this society the future it's not

966
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:38,990
so forth but the number of people that

967
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:44,320
are involved in this that understand us

968
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:50,149
that share this is extremely small I

969
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:52,970
come here and I know personally these

970
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:59,360
people and unfortunately these people

971
00:57:52,970 --> 00:58:01,730
who are in the know are very few we can

972
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:02,450
look at any society be Russian or

973
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:03,869
American

974
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:10,419
[Music]

975
00:58:03,869 --> 00:58:13,029
there are kind of divisions between the

976
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:15,339
different some groups take children for

977
00:58:13,029 --> 00:58:17,710
example they can consume anything you

978
00:58:15,339 --> 00:58:20,950
give them they can they can't digest

979
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:26,140
anything before we used to teach

980
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:26,759
children to cross the street we don't do

981
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:32,288
that anymore

982
00:58:26,759 --> 00:58:34,119
people get killed because because they

983
00:58:32,289 --> 00:58:39,069
are wearing headsets and they don't hear

984
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:43,059
a car coming for example and then adults

985
00:58:39,069 --> 00:58:46,089
adults or middle aged adults many of the

986
00:58:43,059 --> 00:58:48,400
many of the people don't use computers

987
00:58:46,089 --> 00:58:50,558
for example this is a huge number of

988
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:57,700
people who are taxi drivers didn't use

989
00:58:50,559 --> 00:59:02,220
any computers people who are harvested

990
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:05,558
drivers miners so there is a huge

991
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:09,069
stratum of the population that don't

992
00:59:05,559 --> 00:59:16,809
deal with idea at all and then the

993
00:59:09,069 --> 00:59:18,999
elderly the elderly we try to suggest

994
00:59:16,809 --> 00:59:23,349
that the use digital technology but they

995
00:59:18,999 --> 00:59:26,649
are very fun for me and if we don't

996
00:59:23,349 --> 00:59:28,719
according to some statistics if huge

997
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:30,759
swathes of the population are not

998
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:32,170
involved in the national project and by

999
00:59:30,759 --> 00:59:34,599
the way we're talking about a huge

1000
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:38,140
national project which is digitization

1001
00:59:34,599 --> 00:59:44,079
we're trying to jump on this bandwagon

1002
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:49,469
of the 4th or maybe the fifth Industrial

1003
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:52,839
Revolution we're trying not idiot behind

1004
00:59:49,469 --> 00:59:57,920
take another example back in the 1930s

1005
00:59:52,839 --> 01:00:01,509
the USSR was was in very bad shape

1006
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:07,550
the government wanted to accomplish

1007
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:10,760
industrialization certain actions were

1008
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:13,910
taken and overall this was successful

1009
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:15,380
this was a successful experience and the

1010
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:20,990
Great Depression in the United States

1011
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:25,010
after the financial crisis a lot of

1012
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:27,459
people were out of jobs were starving

1013
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:30,760
a lot of people committed suicide

1014
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:35,000
however the government was wise

1015
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:37,130
specifically the president as basically

1016
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:41,060
the president pulled off a national

1017
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:43,310
development program the roads were built

1018
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:50,509
infrastructure was developed the entire

1019
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:53,259
country or worked on the same project

1020
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:58,070
which was to get the country out of that

1021
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:59,420
can he out of that crisis and these are

1022
01:00:58,070 --> 01:01:07,700
positive example but there are also

1023
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:15,640
negative examples in Middle Ages in

1024
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:19,910
medieval ages in medieval ages they were

1025
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:22,520
blue tights or braking machines to just

1026
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:26,680
to keep their jobs in fact when Henry

1027
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:28,700
Ford created his conveyors many people

1028
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:31,430
tried to destroy them

1029
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:34,879
because they try to sabotage things

1030
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:38,700
because they were afraid of losing their

1031
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:44,800
jobs so

1032
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:50,830
back in the 90s one of my friends was a

1033
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:53,050
bit of a textile factory and people were

1034
01:01:50,830 --> 01:01:54,490
even trying to break those machines

1035
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:56,950
because they were afraid that we're

1036
01:01:54,490 --> 01:02:00,729
going to lose their jobs so these things

1037
01:01:56,950 --> 01:02:04,359
happen but what I'm getting at is that

1038
01:02:00,730 --> 01:02:06,640
people have to understand the fact this

1039
01:02:04,359 --> 01:02:08,529
whole digital transformation is the

1040
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:11,440
right thing to do and we have to help

1041
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:14,830
people embrace this idea not to resist

1042
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:20,250
it but to embrace and go towards the

1043
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:24,609
future remember there was the story of

1044
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:28,140
computerization and schools budgets were

1045
01:02:24,609 --> 01:02:30,970
allocated for the acquisition of these

1046
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:33,430
computers and then there was the

1047
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:42,339
question of security I remember I was I

1048
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:45,879
participated in the National lesson and

1049
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:53,320
I remember the government the government

1050
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:56,560
was promoting sponsor and this idea they

1051
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:59,320
were it was a series of lectures about

1052
01:02:56,560 --> 01:03:01,509
what has to be done on what what you

1053
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:03,220
shouldn't be done with what materials

1054
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:06,520
should be used and so they were whole

1055
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:10,180
websites and now there's a huge number

1056
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:14,500
of sites there are lots of materials

1057
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:18,330
about the do's and don'ts but but are

1058
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:21,100
these materials who've read by the by a

1059
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:23,140
significant majority of people in fact

1060
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:28,600
we have will have a new concept here in

1061
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:34,900
the situation digital hygiene digital

1062
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:37,089
hygiene is an old concept that I use 15

1063
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:38,789
years ago but now it's becoming a more

1064
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:44,709
and more relevant

1065
01:03:38,789 --> 01:03:48,849
digital hygiene is something that has

1066
01:03:44,709 --> 01:03:51,189
been around for some time hygiene as a

1067
01:03:48,849 --> 01:03:53,650
concept has been around for a very long

1068
01:03:51,189 --> 01:03:57,368
time we teach our kids and not to pick

1069
01:03:53,650 --> 01:04:00,939
things up from from the ground and put

1070
01:03:57,369 --> 01:04:02,380
it in their mouth or do other things we

1071
01:04:00,939 --> 01:04:06,549
teach them to wash their hands and so on

1072
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:10,869
my proposal to make was our country need

1073
01:04:06,549 --> 01:04:14,979
our country needs a program - a program

1074
01:04:10,869 --> 01:04:18,849
that would help our society and not it's

1075
01:04:14,979 --> 01:04:24,249
part that's already very familiar with

1076
01:04:18,849 --> 01:04:28,449
the digital but the other part that is

1077
01:04:24,249 --> 01:04:32,979
not as familiar with it we have

1078
01:04:28,449 --> 01:04:36,449
discussed I be how good it is and how it

1079
01:04:32,979 --> 01:04:40,448
needs to be protected but let's remember

1080
01:04:36,449 --> 01:04:44,259
remember is the digital signature Act

1081
01:04:40,449 --> 01:04:47,289
that was passed about 10 years ago there

1082
01:04:44,259 --> 01:04:49,569
were huge problems because nobody seemed

1083
01:04:47,289 --> 01:04:52,509
to understand the importance of this

1084
01:04:49,569 --> 01:04:56,199
digital signature after a series of

1085
01:04:52,509 --> 01:04:58,869
actions series of activities we

1086
01:04:56,199 --> 01:05:07,719
literally had to educate the judges

1087
01:04:58,869 --> 01:05:10,829
about the trustworthiness of digital

1088
01:05:07,719 --> 01:05:15,819
signature that it's not inferior tore

1089
01:05:10,829 --> 01:05:19,029
handwritten signature in fact finally

1090
01:05:15,819 --> 01:05:21,219
digital signatures Start has started to

1091
01:05:19,029 --> 01:05:24,999
gain traction it's becoming more and

1092
01:05:21,219 --> 01:05:27,369
more accepted unfortunately due to

1093
01:05:24,999 --> 01:05:31,730
digital hygiene

1094
01:05:27,369 --> 01:05:35,840
people keep their signatures and access

1095
01:05:31,730 --> 01:05:38,510
credentials in notebooks in some files

1096
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:40,760
that they store their hard drive they

1097
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:46,970
don't even know that their digital

1098
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:50,869
signature can be used to forge a

1099
01:05:46,970 --> 01:05:54,379
document and sell their property people

1100
01:05:50,869 --> 01:05:56,450
don't understand this so we've heard a

1101
01:05:54,380 --> 01:06:00,619
lot of good proposals about creating

1102
01:05:56,450 --> 01:06:04,220
great services for for all sorts of

1103
01:06:00,619 --> 01:06:04,640
things but judges have to know what that

1104
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:07,069
is

1105
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:11,990
blockchain is a great thing but several

1106
01:06:07,070 --> 01:06:13,880
days ago 40 million dollars worth of

1107
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:17,569
bitcoins were stolen

1108
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:19,490
what does it mean stolen stolen means

1109
01:06:17,570 --> 01:06:22,369
that there was a transfer of property

1110
01:06:19,490 --> 01:06:23,229
transfer of ownership from one person to

1111
01:06:22,369 --> 01:06:27,280
another

1112
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:32,410
and how do we how do we deal with that

1113
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:37,190
it has to be it has to be factored into

1114
01:06:32,410 --> 01:06:39,859
now law application practices law

1115
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:44,540
application practices are lagging behind

1116
01:06:39,859 --> 01:06:47,450
in it big away group idea I believe -

1117
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:50,330
one year ago two years two years or

1118
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:54,290
maybe one you know is that if you steal

1119
01:06:50,330 --> 01:06:56,930
if you steal a bunch of flowers you can

1120
01:06:54,290 --> 01:06:58,940
get three years in prison but if you

1121
01:06:56,930 --> 01:07:01,520
steal two million rubles from one

1122
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:05,600
account you don't get virtually no

1123
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:13,820
because judges still haven't caught up

1124
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:15,170
with us and I remember back in the state

1125
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:19,180
to move we just came back several years

1126
01:07:15,170 --> 01:07:19,180
ago in the state duma we discussed

1127
01:07:19,339 --> 01:07:28,519
a draft draft laws related to the

1128
01:07:22,490 --> 01:07:31,189
digital sphere and it turns out that is

1129
01:07:28,519 --> 01:07:35,828
that the laws related to the protection

1130
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:38,680
of information protection of information

1131
01:07:35,829 --> 01:07:42,440
is regarded as the protection of

1132
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:45,589
physical property it was very hard to

1133
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:50,359
explain things explain some basic

1134
01:07:45,589 --> 01:07:52,569
concepts to the deputies and that

1135
01:07:50,359 --> 01:07:57,589
reflects the fact that very few people

1136
01:07:52,569 --> 01:08:00,380
understand on a deep level what digital

1137
01:07:57,589 --> 01:08:06,279
signature is what digital role is and I

1138
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:06,279
believe it needs to be a a large-scale

1139
01:08:08,109 --> 01:08:15,140
literacy campaign any matters related to

1140
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:19,159
digital I don't I don't recall that

1141
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:21,040
these programs are available and we need

1142
01:08:19,158 --> 01:08:24,189
to fix it sometime of course I do

1143
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:27,139
lecturers I go to different places I

1144
01:08:24,189 --> 01:08:29,540
explain to people some things that I

1145
01:08:27,139 --> 01:08:35,000
understand but many other people don't

1146
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:37,488
understand it turns out that there are

1147
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,109
lots of resources but people just can

1148
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:44,540
get hold of them they don't even know

1149
01:08:39,109 --> 01:08:46,440
what to search for it look at what the

1150
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:56,029
media says

1151
01:08:46,439 --> 01:08:56,029
I watched television for two days and I

1152
01:08:56,359 --> 01:09:03,750
heard a lot of things that may not be

1153
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:07,470
familiar to the rank-and-file citizens

1154
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:11,939
of Russia so there has to be a central

1155
01:09:07,470 --> 01:09:14,850
resource with that's easy to use that

1156
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:17,309
explains to people in different life

1157
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:19,980
situations so what lawyers are turn to

1158
01:09:17,310 --> 01:09:21,420
how to protect their rights how to

1159
01:09:19,979 --> 01:09:24,599
protect their information and I would

1160
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:30,359
like to suggest to the organizers of

1161
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:33,690
this great forum pH days be to draft an

1162
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:36,359
open letter to the Russian government to

1163
01:09:33,689 --> 01:09:40,349
perhaps the Russian parliament into the

1164
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:43,969
media highlighting and the letter that

1165
01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:43,970
is going to be signed by the

1166
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:49,500
participants of this event and this

1167
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:53,550
letter will highlight each other doing

1168
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:57,600
so the government what they and the

1169
01:09:53,550 --> 01:10:00,270
expert community need to do to get this

1170
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:03,870
off the ground because currently well

1171
01:10:00,270 --> 01:10:05,060
let's face it the situation leaves much

1172
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:07,920
to be desired

1173
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:09,570
so we have to address the seven

1174
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:12,420
structures or set of recommendations

1175
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:17,400
thank you very much whatever you have

1176
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:22,170
just talked about you have just talked

1177
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:26,480
about the need for educational processes

1178
01:10:22,170 --> 01:10:32,070
at all levels there is a federal program

1179
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:33,629
with more education state officials even

1180
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:36,200
for officials working and the

1181
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:41,330
penitentiary systems

1182
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:44,120
in effect we don't have either a

1183
01:10:41,330 --> 01:10:48,110
platform solution or educational

1184
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:51,590
programs we still awaken those two

1185
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:53,269
things so I guess I would completely

1186
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:56,480
agree with what you said and the next

1187
01:10:53,270 --> 01:11:00,940
speaker is the new city safe he will

1188
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:09,530
talk he will talk about security

1189
01:11:00,940 --> 01:11:10,969
questions and about how to get protected

1190
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:15,740
well thanks very much for the

1191
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:19,040
introduction I am doing two projects

1192
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:21,559
creep the police and the BitDefender all

1193
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:26,300
these projects are related to digital

1194
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:28,070
hygiene digital security which is

1195
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:32,000
exactly something we've been discussing

1196
01:11:28,070 --> 01:11:35,179
for the last 10 minutes I am NOT going

1197
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:38,660
to discuss with you what these projects

1198
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:42,800
are but I would like to talk more about

1199
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:49,639
artificial intelligence what it does or

1200
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:51,860
what it's it were it its role is our

1201
01:11:49,640 --> 01:12:02,210
official intelligence since is in its

1202
01:11:51,860 --> 01:12:08,309
infancy yet but it's already here so

1203
01:12:02,210 --> 01:12:13,840
where do we use AI or machine learning

1204
01:12:08,310 --> 01:12:16,810
each of you present here are already

1205
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:19,450
using some or all of these services and

1206
01:12:16,810 --> 01:12:25,470
all of them have AI

1207
01:12:19,450 --> 01:12:28,269
in it in finance in banks already we are

1208
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:31,920
identified using our voice print and

1209
01:12:28,270 --> 01:12:36,640
machine learning is at the core of this

1210
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:41,110
translation services Yandex Google

1211
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:45,850
Translate all of those things are built

1212
01:12:41,110 --> 01:12:53,380
on the eye and there are even attempts

1213
01:12:45,850 --> 01:13:04,440
at simultaneous interpretation based on

1214
01:12:53,380 --> 01:13:10,140
AI and in search in search engines

1215
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:13,179
you also have machine learning nai but

1216
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:19,960
recently thanks to advances in machine

1217
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:24,760
learning the quality of search is much

1218
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:29,640
better spam protection is another

1219
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:34,300
application of AI antivirus is

1220
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:38,830
BitDefender as an example it also has

1221
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:41,320
some AI capabilities and one of the more

1222
01:13:38,830 --> 01:13:49,150
recent trends

1223
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:51,460
is self-driving cars drive less cars it

1224
01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:56,559
was a test recently Tesla was caught in

1225
01:13:51,460 --> 01:14:02,470
a trap the well the Tesla car was caught

1226
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:04,540
in a spot it's all surrounded by solid

1227
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:06,190
lines so the car and got in but it

1228
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:11,019
couldn't get out it's a very simple

1229
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:18,250
story that's is you can reproduce just

1230
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:26,460
using adhesive adhesive tape so AI it

1231
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:26,460
works but it can be trapped so we know

1232
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:33,850
we know that these technologies work and

1233
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:37,050
I have tried to kind of classify them on

1234
01:14:33,850 --> 01:14:39,850
their slides these technologies include

1235
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:41,860
recognition ranking recommendation

1236
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:45,430
classification anomaly detection and

1237
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:49,870
regression all all of you know what

1238
01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:55,050
these are currently in neural networks

1239
01:14:49,870 --> 01:14:59,460
and machine learning are used for

1240
01:14:55,050 --> 01:15:02,460
identifying for object identification

1241
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:02,460
and

1242
01:15:04,970 --> 01:15:15,600
computing vectors for specific persons

1243
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:18,330
and the same thing for ranking we rank

1244
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:21,290
for example websites based on relevance

1245
01:15:18,330 --> 01:15:23,430
based on what we're searching for

1246
01:15:21,290 --> 01:15:26,990
recommendation engines are very

1247
01:15:23,430 --> 01:15:32,550
widespread for example in IV dot are you

1248
01:15:26,990 --> 01:15:35,190
on Netflix and Yandex so when we listen

1249
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:37,350
to a bunch of music then we get

1250
01:15:35,190 --> 01:15:41,490
recommendations that closely match our

1251
01:15:37,350 --> 01:15:44,280
musical preferences the same thing is

1252
01:15:41,490 --> 01:15:48,210
with video services audio services

1253
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:56,130
anomaly detection anomaly detection is a

1254
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:59,130
great use case for AI for example we

1255
01:15:56,130 --> 01:16:03,540
have data and we can detect anomalies in

1256
01:15:59,130 --> 01:16:06,270
it something that may be a telltale a

1257
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:07,920
science of some anomalous activity and

1258
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:12,350
machine learning is a great tool for

1259
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:16,200
anomaly detection regression regression

1260
01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:19,320
is basically about projection let's say

1261
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:22,200
for example we will come to a bank and

1262
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:25,259
we don't have any credit history

1263
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:27,030
so what does a bank do it can take a

1264
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:29,220
number of parameters and computer

1265
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:33,599
regression will regress a score of our

1266
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:38,120
credit worthiness China you've probably

1267
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:44,210
heard about this there is

1268
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:50,219
classic black mirror story in China now

1269
01:16:44,210 --> 01:16:54,090
so a person originally has 120 points

1270
01:16:50,219 --> 01:16:57,090
and this person can either get or lose

1271
01:16:54,090 --> 01:17:00,620
these points based on how all the white

1272
01:16:57,090 --> 01:17:06,330
in this person is for example if you

1273
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:10,889
drop trash in the street you lose a few

1274
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:15,150
points and this is serious because this

1275
01:17:10,889 --> 01:17:19,350
this digital story this digital history

1276
01:17:15,150 --> 01:17:21,929
is yours and you have to be really

1277
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:25,770
careful because that may affect all

1278
01:17:21,929 --> 01:17:31,679
sorts of your all aspects of your life

1279
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:41,280
this is X this is a case when a science

1280
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:42,789
fiction scenario became true so

1281
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:49,480
[Music]

1282
01:17:42,789 --> 01:17:54,280
all of these things are here with us and

1283
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:56,699
whether they are good or bad really

1284
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:56,699
depends

1285
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:01,369
[Music]

1286
01:18:12,930 --> 01:18:18,100
there are adversarial attacks

1287
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:23,320
adversarial attacks is when you change

1288
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:27,400
it slightly in an image and you present

1289
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:30,750
it to the model and you get the model to

1290
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:34,750
produce a prediction that you need

1291
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:37,330
although it's a wrong projection for

1292
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:39,070
example phase detection phase detection

1293
01:18:37,330 --> 01:18:42,280
what do you do what do you do if a

1294
01:18:39,070 --> 01:18:45,219
person gets older you are still the same

1295
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:50,469
person but you're an older version of

1296
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:54,520
this person and the system has to

1297
01:18:50,470 --> 01:18:57,520
accommodate this but sometimes we can

1298
01:18:54,520 --> 01:19:02,370
change a few pixels sometimes it is

1299
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:02,370
enough to change one single pixel and

1300
01:19:02,850 --> 01:19:09,460
the system may produce a of wrong

1301
01:19:05,850 --> 01:19:13,140
projection that's called an adversarial

1302
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:16,140
attack sometimes this can be done on

1303
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:16,140
purpose

1304
01:19:17,370 --> 01:19:26,710
that that raises some serious issues

1305
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:30,220
that there is some serious security

1306
01:19:26,710 --> 01:19:34,510
issues you can target attack you can

1307
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:37,270
target an attack against AI or you can

1308
01:19:34,510 --> 01:19:40,930
use a non targeted attack you can just

1309
01:19:37,270 --> 01:19:45,570
add some random noise to your image

1310
01:19:40,930 --> 01:19:50,230
input image or to some input data and

1311
01:19:45,570 --> 01:19:54,000
mess up the models predictions in

1312
01:19:50,230 --> 01:19:54,000
BitDefender we consider this our

1313
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:08,110
artificial intelligence is sort of

1314
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:09,599
dependent still kind of dependent on the

1315
01:20:08,110 --> 01:20:14,830
human envelope

1316
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:18,070
Rai catches the samples that are either

1317
01:20:14,830 --> 01:20:26,590
the same or there are many of such

1318
01:20:18,070 --> 01:20:33,370
samples and the face means that our

1319
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:38,290
system is vulnerable to ddos and there

1320
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:41,559
are DDoS attacks so will we work using

1321
01:20:38,290 --> 01:20:44,620
the black box paradigm we use a model

1322
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:48,280
but we don't open-source it we don't

1323
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:51,280
release it into the public because this

1324
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:53,080
is the way for us to partially protect

1325
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:54,219
ourselves in terms of the infrastructure

1326
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:56,980
in terms of Hell work

1327
01:20:54,220 --> 01:21:00,010
on the other hand what we have an

1328
01:20:56,980 --> 01:21:06,339
addition here as an addition here is the

1329
01:21:00,010 --> 01:21:08,910
human that allows conducting many of

1330
01:21:06,340 --> 01:21:11,500
investigations if we see that some virus

1331
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:14,349
looks like something else

1332
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:18,460
so maybe doesn't resemble but has been

1333
01:21:14,350 --> 01:21:21,220
built according to similar principles as

1334
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:22,719
a result we can identify

1335
01:21:21,220 --> 01:21:25,150
quite

1336
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:28,840
fast and quite reliable if the system is

1337
01:21:25,150 --> 01:21:30,519
being attacked and then we reteach you

1338
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:33,310
teach the system

1339
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:36,250
additionally so for instance talk about

1340
01:21:33,310 --> 01:21:38,800
pictures we adds noise ourselves

1341
01:21:36,250 --> 01:21:44,469
following certain algorithm saying that

1342
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:46,840
this is a corrupted image and please

1343
01:21:44,469 --> 01:21:51,430
bear in mind that so we've done it on

1344
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:53,770
purpose so on the one hand you first you

1345
01:21:51,430 --> 01:21:56,620
first need to find to identify the

1346
01:21:53,770 --> 01:22:00,010
person on hand but at the end say you

1347
01:21:56,620 --> 01:22:02,050
need to teach the system to do it in a

1348
01:22:00,010 --> 01:22:04,480
more reliable way well the other and

1349
01:22:02,050 --> 01:22:09,210
there are several different algorithms

1350
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:13,299
to identify each virus so even if

1351
01:22:09,210 --> 01:22:15,520
through some chance or somebody has

1352
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:18,310
spent a lot of time thinking about how

1353
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:23,400
to cheat our system so if they've

1354
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:26,920
managed to cheat one algorithm then

1355
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:29,830
another algorithm will be a run against

1356
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:32,770
the file based on other principles and

1357
01:22:29,830 --> 01:22:36,550
it'll issue a different verdict so the

1358
01:22:32,770 --> 01:22:39,699
system as a result that turns out to be

1359
01:22:36,550 --> 01:22:42,850
a bit more sophisticated more complex

1360
01:22:39,699 --> 01:22:46,150
than in other Ivy engines but so we

1361
01:22:42,850 --> 01:22:49,270
understand that it allows us protecting

1362
01:22:46,150 --> 01:22:53,559
not only users better but also to train

1363
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:55,600
our AI better that's it thank you well

1364
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:59,949
Dennis thank you thank you for the

1365
01:22:55,600 --> 01:23:03,520
constructive ideas and as a expert I'd

1366
01:22:59,949 --> 01:23:09,610
like to dispel one of the myths today

1367
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:15,820
the tagging voice messages so switching

1368
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:20,380
the phone on unauthorized listening so

1369
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:22,809
the AI will be determining a human

1370
01:23:20,380 --> 01:23:25,390
behavior how expensive it is is it being

1371
01:23:22,810 --> 01:23:29,579
used it is clearly too expensive today

1372
01:23:25,390 --> 01:23:32,610
and you have to understand when to use a

1373
01:23:29,579 --> 01:23:35,250
and when not to because indeed both in

1374
01:23:32,610 --> 01:23:36,929
terms of the infrastructure and in terms

1375
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:39,570
of things of structure you need to have

1376
01:23:36,929 --> 01:23:42,690
quite a lot of hardware and a lot of

1377
01:23:39,570 --> 01:23:45,179
software also in terms of the human

1378
01:23:42,690 --> 01:23:48,119
resources setting up and to teaching

1379
01:23:45,179 --> 01:23:51,659
these things you need a lot but if you

1380
01:23:48,119 --> 01:23:53,848
talk about Moscow underground Moscow

1381
01:23:51,659 --> 01:23:58,190
Metro there are a lot of people and

1382
01:23:53,849 --> 01:24:00,809
videos that you just can't physically

1383
01:23:58,190 --> 01:24:05,280
process but in retail they actively use

1384
01:24:00,809 --> 01:24:09,480
both face pay and although stories in

1385
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:11,820
terms of downloading the preferences in

1386
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:14,459
the US and Europe it is yes it's it's so

1387
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:16,860
if you enter one of the top Amazon

1388
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:21,960
stores in the u.s. having a register

1389
01:24:16,860 --> 01:24:26,699
there you can run by the shelves collect

1390
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:30,929
all the products not use any check out

1391
01:24:26,699 --> 01:24:34,440
points or credit cards everything will

1392
01:24:30,929 --> 01:24:37,980
be debited sell to your account a

1393
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:39,900
scanners are enough so a idol is already

1394
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:42,000
living together with us thank you very

1395
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:44,549
much Dennis and just in the situation

1396
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,889
I'd like to pass the floor to Ilya will

1397
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:50,309
be the last speaker at a panel

1398
01:24:46,889 --> 01:24:54,329
discussion after which show will handle

1399
01:24:50,309 --> 01:24:57,719
your questions well perhaps in terms of

1400
01:24:54,329 --> 01:25:02,308
health the world outlook is changing

1401
01:24:57,719 --> 01:25:04,679
today for the younger brackets idiom is

1402
01:25:02,309 --> 01:25:06,389
the youngest participant to our panel

1403
01:25:04,679 --> 01:25:07,139
discussions so it's up to him to answer

1404
01:25:06,389 --> 01:25:09,360
these questions

1405
01:25:07,139 --> 01:25:12,690
hello everyone dear friends I would like

1406
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:15,960
to talk to you about such an important

1407
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:18,839
subject that I've been dealing with for

1408
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:21,690
quite a long time the project has been

1409
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:24,329
existence for several years now it's

1410
01:25:21,690 --> 01:25:28,888
called monolith plus and it's an IT

1411
01:25:24,329 --> 01:25:32,070
security project so the aspect I'd like

1412
01:25:28,889 --> 01:25:33,900
to discuss relates to your mobile

1413
01:25:32,070 --> 01:25:36,420
devices your smartphones so that you

1414
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:39,299
carry with you everyday that's all of

1415
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:41,639
you and what modern digital

1416
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:43,829
and society globalization brings you

1417
01:25:41,639 --> 01:25:47,880
what additional risks you're getting to

1418
01:25:43,829 --> 01:25:50,849
deal with a lot of you perhaps guess

1419
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:53,820
that your devices collect quite a lot of

1420
01:25:50,849 --> 01:25:57,510
data about you both directly including

1421
01:25:53,820 --> 01:26:01,679
messages pictures video and audio and

1422
01:25:57,510 --> 01:26:05,909
also metadata metadata is about what

1423
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:08,730
when time and addresses the data that

1424
01:26:05,909 --> 01:26:12,179
allow identifying you and characterize

1425
01:26:08,730 --> 01:26:14,549
you but without any data so there are

1426
01:26:12,179 --> 01:26:16,679
some obvious things about these like

1427
01:26:14,550 --> 01:26:24,900
geolocation data phone numbers and

1428
01:26:16,679 --> 01:26:28,320
others but technologies allow you a lot

1429
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:30,929
of systems to work with a data that's

1430
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:33,420
not quite obvious to you the data that

1431
01:26:30,929 --> 01:26:37,380
you smoke a smartphone vendor or

1432
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:40,619
software vendor is not informing you

1433
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:43,920
about because lots of data are collected

1434
01:26:40,619 --> 01:26:45,679
not by the software vendor but those who

1435
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:48,239
create the advertising platform

1436
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:50,909
collecting analytical data to approve

1437
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:53,250
the application later of what's of

1438
01:26:50,909 --> 01:26:56,339
interest to the environment data the

1439
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:58,559
data surrounding you records from the

1440
01:26:56,340 --> 01:27:01,770
microphone geotags

1441
01:26:58,559 --> 01:27:04,320
through audio recordings information

1442
01:27:01,770 --> 01:27:08,730
about devices that surround you

1443
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:12,540
Bluetooth Wi-Fi of GSM all the devices

1444
01:27:08,730 --> 01:27:14,428
that are in your direct vicinity I mean

1445
01:27:12,540 --> 01:27:17,219
people are trying to target that as well

1446
01:27:14,429 --> 01:27:21,409
many of you don't know but what's up

1447
01:27:17,219 --> 01:27:25,320
according to our research periodically

1448
01:27:21,409 --> 01:27:28,739
puts small audio tags not really the

1449
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:31,829
tracker but to help in geo navigation or

1450
01:27:28,739 --> 01:27:36,750
any approach and mcdonnell's also abroad

1451
01:27:31,829 --> 01:27:38,790
and there's some audio source that you

1452
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:40,920
can't hear but your microphone can hear

1453
01:27:38,790 --> 01:27:42,330
that so what's up identifies that your

1454
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:46,470
next down

1455
01:27:42,330 --> 01:27:50,309
what else behavior your application

1456
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:53,250
behavior tracking what you do with your

1457
01:27:50,310 --> 01:27:55,830
finger what you do the application where

1458
01:27:53,250 --> 01:27:59,390
you transfer it click how much time do

1459
01:27:55,830 --> 01:28:06,030
you take to make a decision where you

1460
01:27:59,390 --> 01:28:08,400
tap first tap second also cross tracking

1461
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:10,920
data he's been collecting collecting

1462
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:14,250
data from the neighboring application

1463
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:17,040
apps many of you have heard there was a

1464
01:28:14,250 --> 01:28:19,800
huge ear out with Burger King the mobile

1465
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:21,870
app that I was just taking video

1466
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:22,940
recording for mobile phone sending it to

1467
01:28:21,870 --> 01:28:28,500
Burger King

1468
01:28:22,940 --> 01:28:31,280
service they didn't even bother to care

1469
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:35,340
about your privacy and the last thing

1470
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:38,700
psychophysiology in neurophysiology it's

1471
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:41,600
basically not just taking data but

1472
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:43,830
trying to understand your personality

1473
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:46,380
analyze it you start your way of

1474
01:28:43,830 --> 01:28:48,870
thinking the way of making decision if a

1475
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:51,390
deeper level not a failure direct

1476
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:53,220
actions but for making conclusions and

1477
01:28:51,390 --> 01:28:55,470
further actions and how you how they can

1478
01:28:53,220 --> 01:28:59,670
affect it so who collects this data

1479
01:28:55,470 --> 01:29:01,980
actually everybody else devices collects

1480
01:28:59,670 --> 01:29:05,580
data every element of the device

1481
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:07,889
collects data except for the case radio

1482
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:10,080
module modem that connects you to the

1483
01:29:07,890 --> 01:29:13,920
base stations not although you know but

1484
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:17,330
it's a separate operating system so the

1485
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:22,770
device within your device which lives

1486
01:29:17,330 --> 01:29:24,510
autonomously collecting data and I'll

1487
01:29:22,770 --> 01:29:29,220
tell you most about the data most

1488
01:29:24,510 --> 01:29:31,770
facility the CPU all CPU manufacturers

1489
01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:34,770
Qualcomm Apple and others if they want

1490
01:29:31,770 --> 01:29:36,230
to sell the devices in the EU in the US

1491
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:40,159
they

1492
01:29:36,230 --> 01:29:43,909
must license additional functionality of

1493
01:29:40,159 --> 01:29:46,250
the CPUs include the telemetry unit that

1494
01:29:43,909 --> 01:29:49,400
collects data from the apps that are

1495
01:29:46,250 --> 01:29:52,960
running the operating system goes

1496
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:56,780
without saying that user apps also

1497
01:29:52,960 --> 01:30:00,679
what's in not obvious it's why you get

1498
01:29:56,780 --> 01:30:02,870
connected the operator base station so

1499
01:30:00,679 --> 01:30:05,030
the operator that you connect with they

1500
01:30:02,870 --> 01:30:09,409
collect additional data they analyze

1501
01:30:05,030 --> 01:30:13,429
this data that's the lawful intercept

1502
01:30:09,409 --> 01:30:19,960
song three system to collect all data in

1503
01:30:13,429 --> 01:30:27,770
terms of Public Safety and crime

1504
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:31,760
identification operator network so many

1505
01:30:27,770 --> 01:30:36,679
of you have thought about ss7 signalling

1506
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:39,739
protocol it's a separate network that

1507
01:30:36,679 --> 01:30:41,659
allows you know all operators exchange

1508
01:30:39,739 --> 01:30:45,409
data back to you for instance you've

1509
01:30:41,659 --> 01:30:48,110
arrived in different country you keep

1510
01:30:45,409 --> 01:30:50,019
using your device in a roaming mode just

1511
01:30:48,110 --> 01:30:53,480
like you can do it in your home today

1512
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:55,790
how to fix a privacy actually our

1513
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:57,349
conclusion for the moment that there may

1514
01:30:55,790 --> 01:31:00,320
be a lot of discussion but in our

1515
01:30:57,350 --> 01:31:04,699
opinion as a company that does IT

1516
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:06,530
security there's no privacy at all what

1517
01:31:04,699 --> 01:31:09,830
do they call privacy now is that all the

1518
01:31:06,530 --> 01:31:12,349
data collected about you is the person

1519
01:31:09,830 --> 01:31:14,840
lies so it doesn't have a tag mister

1520
01:31:12,350 --> 01:31:17,989
even now mr. Petrov there are some IDs

1521
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:21,260
assigned but it's quite easy to decode

1522
01:31:17,989 --> 01:31:23,419
them all the way to identifying the

1523
01:31:21,260 --> 01:31:26,560
personality of the person so there's no

1524
01:31:23,420 --> 01:31:29,960
anonymity at all all your actions

1525
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:32,840
tracked and logged and it's not about

1526
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:34,880
some evil you know Secret Service agent

1527
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:37,340
collecting data the reason to collect

1528
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:40,820
this data are absolutely different the

1529
01:31:37,340 --> 01:31:42,090
basic reason is marketing absolutely all

1530
01:31:40,820 --> 01:31:44,969
of your actions

1531
01:31:42,090 --> 01:31:48,120
and so it's valuable information for

1532
01:31:44,970 --> 01:31:50,160
marketing that can be sold what you talk

1533
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:52,170
about what you write what you look for

1534
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:55,950
how we interact is a marketing

1535
01:31:52,170 --> 01:31:59,400
information it's a valuable order to

1536
01:31:55,950 --> 01:32:02,160
record your data not really to you know

1537
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:04,589
build a court case against you but

1538
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:06,510
because it's a market information your

1539
01:32:04,590 --> 01:32:10,230
cellular operator will collect this data

1540
01:32:06,510 --> 01:32:13,410
and sell it to you know we're supposed

1541
01:32:10,230 --> 01:32:16,080
to choose manufacture or you do healthy

1542
01:32:13,410 --> 01:32:19,170
life and they will sell it we like

1543
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:21,180
burgers and it'll set up so if the first

1544
01:32:19,170 --> 01:32:24,740
user of this market information for some

1545
01:32:21,180 --> 01:32:29,090
reason is the government even though

1546
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:31,769
what I just said it's a marketing thing

1547
01:32:29,090 --> 01:32:36,090
special services are interested in this

1548
01:32:31,770 --> 01:32:43,200
information market information is also

1549
01:32:36,090 --> 01:32:47,250
used to in elections if your digital

1550
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:50,730
track disappears you will attract the

1551
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:52,980
information forces us so V p.m. in the

1552
01:32:50,730 --> 01:32:56,070
Apple market or Android Market you

1553
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:59,490
believe that you're safe no any action

1554
01:32:56,070 --> 01:33:01,940
of yours that doesn't match your digital

1555
01:32:59,490 --> 01:33:04,889
trace will only attract additional

1556
01:33:01,940 --> 01:33:06,599
attention to your somebody must have had

1557
01:33:04,890 --> 01:33:10,080
there are lots of tools that you can

1558
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:12,990
find different markets such as a hacker

1559
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:15,170
sim you insert a hacker sim and you

1560
01:33:12,990 --> 01:33:19,590
become completely invisible photosystems

1561
01:33:15,170 --> 01:33:24,050
every experts will tell you that it's

1562
01:33:19,590 --> 01:33:27,870
the usual global roaming same cards that

1563
01:33:24,050 --> 01:33:29,960
gets connected to the classic base

1564
01:33:27,870 --> 01:33:34,290
station can be run from megaphone and

1565
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:37,020
it's immediately is highlighted in the

1566
01:33:34,290 --> 01:33:39,710
red list if you are so VPN or some other

1567
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:43,060
new misers you also attract attention

1568
01:33:39,710 --> 01:33:46,050
this information goes deeper level

1569
01:33:43,060 --> 01:33:52,960
it gets collected gets analyzed and

1570
01:33:46,050 --> 01:33:56,380
vendors and operators keep an eye pay

1571
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:58,210
additional attention to you basically

1572
01:33:56,380 --> 01:34:01,180
it's a signal for them to take a closer

1573
01:33:58,210 --> 01:34:04,240
look at you what you do what to do about

1574
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:06,040
an anaemic today and can anything be

1575
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:09,000
done at all of course

1576
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:11,440
what I've said is valid no anonymity

1577
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:17,680
everything is being collected but what

1578
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:20,049
specific can do if you want to break the

1579
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:22,420
link between the behavioral information

1580
01:34:20,050 --> 01:34:25,930
your personality you need to create a

1581
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:28,060
specific special digital personality

1582
01:34:25,930 --> 01:34:30,540
it's a difficult process but

1583
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:37,810
nevertheless it's the only solution for

1584
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:40,269
you to differentiate between yourself in

1585
01:34:37,810 --> 01:34:41,980
your real life and your digital behavior

1586
01:34:40,270 --> 01:34:44,260
the information your actions should not

1587
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:46,269
come aside if you've bought if you both

1588
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:49,570
want to have found it put it next to

1589
01:34:46,270 --> 01:34:52,360
your main phone and if you built your

1590
01:34:49,570 --> 01:34:56,759
digital personality but started it on

1591
01:34:52,360 --> 01:35:00,809
your own device you can count on that

1592
01:34:56,760 --> 01:35:06,220
digital personality and not being

1593
01:35:00,810 --> 01:35:11,350
separate from you anymore and the last

1594
01:35:06,220 --> 01:35:15,490
thing it's quite curious a lot of people

1595
01:35:11,350 --> 01:35:17,440
use some patterns of maximum and an

1596
01:35:15,490 --> 01:35:19,870
image here we use a different way we

1597
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:24,299
tried to build a digital personality

1598
01:35:19,870 --> 01:35:29,110
that looks most like an average

1599
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:33,190
subscriber so all operators and vendors

1600
01:35:29,110 --> 01:35:35,920
as you see this digital personality has

1601
01:35:33,190 --> 01:35:38,669
a typical user like a student or maybe

1602
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:41,470
an old lady so the total data they get

1603
01:35:38,670 --> 01:35:43,710
would indicate that this is a person

1604
01:35:41,470 --> 01:35:44,920
representing a presenting no interest

1605
01:35:43,710 --> 01:35:47,230
the

1606
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:49,780
less your conspiracy as a digital

1607
01:35:47,230 --> 01:35:53,309
personality the more anonymous you

1608
01:35:49,780 --> 01:35:57,780
become in the safer you are

1609
01:35:53,310 --> 01:35:57,780
and the last thing I wanted to mention

1610
01:35:58,170 --> 01:36:03,850
changes are necessary in providing for

1611
01:36:02,110 --> 01:36:07,030
the critical process security but the

1612
01:36:03,850 --> 01:36:09,219
paradigm has shifted if in the past when

1613
01:36:07,030 --> 01:36:11,349
you wanted to create something really

1614
01:36:09,219 --> 01:36:13,750
protected like a data center you need to

1615
01:36:11,350 --> 01:36:18,610
protect your secret and most important

1616
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:21,280
files or let's take a volcano you build

1617
01:36:18,610 --> 01:36:24,610
a data center the volcano well currently

1618
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:26,920
if when you're finished building your

1619
01:36:24,610 --> 01:36:29,170
Davison in a volcano a Chinese

1620
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:30,580
representatives a Russian Secret Service

1621
01:36:29,170 --> 01:36:33,489
representative will already be there

1622
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:36,100
actually currently protecting something

1623
01:36:33,489 --> 01:36:40,750
through hiding in its some bunker or

1624
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:42,699
some hardened accessible place doesn't

1625
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:45,130
work by the time are your future

1626
01:36:42,699 --> 01:36:49,650
projects there won't be no safety and

1627
01:36:45,130 --> 01:36:52,870
security but another opportunity arose

1628
01:36:49,650 --> 01:36:56,980
through the development of clouds or

1629
01:36:52,870 --> 01:37:00,370
platforms it's become possible to get

1630
01:36:56,980 --> 01:37:02,620
lost in the crowd when you're looking

1631
01:37:00,370 --> 01:37:06,000
into micro-services you're looking into

1632
01:37:02,620 --> 01:37:10,719
some behavioral analysis or scenarios

1633
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:15,640
you can just take the data that you need

1634
01:37:10,719 --> 01:37:20,980
to get protected and just to hide them

1635
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:23,739
in a lot of other data so that nobody

1636
01:37:20,980 --> 01:37:26,589
will pay attention and it won't be

1637
01:37:23,739 --> 01:37:30,699
possible to find them and also it will

1638
01:37:26,590 --> 01:37:33,489
make it possible for you to move to a

1639
01:37:30,699 --> 01:37:35,759
different place if you feel that the

1640
01:37:33,489 --> 01:37:38,709
situation is getting risky you can just

1641
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:42,970
replace your data

1642
01:37:38,710 --> 01:37:46,810
thank you very much just one question in

1643
01:37:42,970 --> 01:37:49,330
similar situations as it looks today the

1644
01:37:46,810 --> 01:37:53,230
main trend of the Year 2019 and the

1645
01:37:49,330 --> 01:37:57,390
coming years I mean all made IT systems

1646
01:37:53,230 --> 01:38:00,910
that they're all large major trusted

1647
01:37:57,390 --> 01:38:02,290
world level world-class programs so

1648
01:38:00,910 --> 01:38:06,639
coming back to the question of digital

1649
01:38:02,290 --> 01:38:08,920
hygiene maybe it makes sense to be as

1650
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:10,860
open as possible securing yourself from

1651
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:13,270
the first day really well of course

1652
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:16,080
because everything is I open everything

1653
01:38:13,270 --> 01:38:19,390
has been connected you should always

1654
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:25,210
remember that in your interactions of

1655
01:38:19,390 --> 01:38:29,020
course you need to learn practicing

1656
01:38:25,210 --> 01:38:31,750
digital hygiene publish as little data

1657
01:38:29,020 --> 01:38:35,380
as possible because it will be able to

1658
01:38:31,750 --> 01:38:41,760
collect so it needs from you the

1659
01:38:35,380 --> 01:38:45,040
situation has become quite dramatic now

1660
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:48,160
we can't choose if you want to go

1661
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:51,400
digital or not so even if we don't use

1662
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:52,860
into Instagram because you see then

1663
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:56,860
attacks is something

1664
01:38:52,860 --> 01:39:02,349
sue-shaun switches on so your cards are

1665
01:38:56,860 --> 01:39:08,080
being read your face may face or any

1666
01:39:02,350 --> 01:39:10,840
matching captures you in any point of

1667
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:13,150
the city and you digitized it so clear

1668
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:15,190
so the question is goes the other way

1669
01:39:13,150 --> 01:39:19,990
it's about socialization and it's a

1670
01:39:15,190 --> 01:39:25,269
question to a big AI and intellectual

1671
01:39:19,990 --> 01:39:28,809
property experts AI has already started

1672
01:39:25,270 --> 01:39:31,780
creating its products should they be

1673
01:39:28,810 --> 01:39:34,540
protected are they the author or it's

1674
01:39:31,780 --> 01:39:36,370
the author of this AI who is the owner

1675
01:39:34,540 --> 01:39:40,570
there are two approaches I think the

1676
01:39:36,370 --> 01:39:43,579
American and the European one in the

1677
01:39:40,570 --> 01:39:46,420
American system

1678
01:39:43,579 --> 01:39:50,509
rights belong to the organization that

1679
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:53,570
provided for the creation of the AI -

1680
01:39:50,510 --> 01:39:56,989
it's considered as a tool so just like

1681
01:39:53,570 --> 01:40:00,558
you created the machine that creates

1682
01:39:56,989 --> 01:40:02,959
products both the products and the

1683
01:40:00,559 --> 01:40:05,920
machine are yours even though the

1684
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:09,079
machine can be quite ingenious in

1685
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:10,639
creating the products whereas the latest

1686
01:40:09,079 --> 01:40:13,730
European approach that I've read about

1687
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:17,900
is in that everything that has been

1688
01:40:13,730 --> 01:40:20,449
generated by AI will pass into some

1689
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:23,989
structure where is a cosign public

1690
01:40:20,449 --> 01:40:27,710
domain and any person any organization

1691
01:40:23,989 --> 01:40:30,500
any company can use it of course making

1692
01:40:27,710 --> 01:40:34,719
a reference to this AI I think the

1693
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:40,429
American approach is better because it

1694
01:40:34,719 --> 01:40:43,849
offers more opportunity for investment

1695
01:40:40,429 --> 01:40:47,780
and say it's up further business to

1696
01:40:43,849 --> 01:40:50,570
create AI because here it's quite clear

1697
01:40:47,780 --> 01:40:52,849
how to get profits from the operation of

1698
01:40:50,570 --> 01:40:58,369
AI so there are two different approaches

1699
01:40:52,849 --> 01:41:01,750
well there's another trend what is

1700
01:40:58,369 --> 01:41:04,670
reality global development of bots

1701
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:10,210
started when an intelligent bot has been

1702
01:41:04,670 --> 01:41:14,329
created so that your responsive your

1703
01:41:10,210 --> 01:41:18,619
psychometric responses are read by the

1704
01:41:14,329 --> 01:41:22,940
system and when big they become part of

1705
01:41:18,619 --> 01:41:27,920
big data so your twin gets generated on

1706
01:41:22,940 --> 01:41:30,079
an intelligent level so there's a

1707
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:32,079
question if it's been created by your

1708
01:41:30,079 --> 01:41:36,860
bot so then it's your own property or

1709
01:41:32,079 --> 01:41:38,420
it's something else so coming back to

1710
01:41:36,860 --> 01:41:40,308
the first question conceived the story

1711
01:41:38,420 --> 01:41:43,880
of what's primary was secondary

1712
01:41:40,309 --> 01:41:46,400
the chicken or the egg also discussing

1713
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:48,670
the neural network products who the

1714
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:51,500
author is also we've had this discussion

1715
01:41:48,670 --> 01:41:54,559
privately which is been discussed

1716
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:55,499
it was about that ape who's made a

1717
01:41:54,559 --> 01:41:59,729
selfie who

1718
01:41:55,499 --> 01:42:02,249
has the right viii or the person who

1719
01:41:59,729 --> 01:42:06,809
taught it or the device maybe yes or the

1720
01:42:02,249 --> 01:42:09,989
device so my deep conviction is that we

1721
01:42:06,809 --> 01:42:13,260
all live in a world where everything has

1722
01:42:09,989 --> 01:42:15,239
been done for humans including the laws

1723
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:17,219
written all countries they were written

1724
01:42:15,239 --> 01:42:18,959
by people and they were written for

1725
01:42:17,219 --> 01:42:20,670
people so whenever we're talking about

1726
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:28,159
some things it's always about humans

1727
01:42:20,670 --> 01:42:37,440
just with reference to apes as with AI

1728
01:42:28,159 --> 01:42:39,989
as to the story with some image actually

1729
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:43,440
we're creating something like that the

1730
01:42:39,989 --> 01:42:46,018
virtual reality that allows people to

1731
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:48,268
have an additional communication channel

1732
01:42:46,019 --> 01:42:51,719
with different services where the

1733
01:42:48,269 --> 01:42:55,889
employee gets an avatar in some virtual

1734
01:42:51,719 --> 01:42:59,550
reality and then when you come to an

1735
01:42:55,889 --> 01:43:02,880
office you may choose who to talk with

1736
01:42:59,550 --> 01:43:08,369
with a live person over there avatar in

1737
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:12,780
a check modes or invoice by one voice so

1738
01:43:08,369 --> 01:43:19,249
you can take a legal perspective at the

1739
01:43:12,780 --> 01:43:22,170
point who possesses the rights so

1740
01:43:19,249 --> 01:43:24,780
because the person that you're taking

1741
01:43:22,170 --> 01:43:26,999
avatar from should also be consulted to

1742
01:43:24,780 --> 01:43:30,690
all obtain permission from

1743
01:43:26,999 --> 01:43:34,139
yes indeed this augmented reality thing

1744
01:43:30,690 --> 01:43:36,539
and the thing about all sorts of

1745
01:43:34,139 --> 01:43:39,019
emotional voters psychosomatic boards

1746
01:43:36,539 --> 01:43:42,900
they have been tested in different

1747
01:43:39,019 --> 01:43:44,880
bosses and exchanges trading floors who

1748
01:43:42,900 --> 01:43:48,089
world over and they turned out to be an

1749
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:51,599
excellent fit because every trading a

1750
01:43:48,090 --> 01:43:54,659
trading station is quite expensive both

1751
01:43:51,599 --> 01:43:57,539
in terms of software and hardware and at

1752
01:43:54,659 --> 01:44:01,750
the end of the day it turned out that a

1753
01:43:57,539 --> 01:44:06,710
bot plus of the person itself

1754
01:44:01,750 --> 01:44:11,510
while working in the home is clear that

1755
01:44:06,710 --> 01:44:16,100
can work 24 hours a day they work more

1756
01:44:11,510 --> 01:44:18,680
effectively than just a person working

1757
01:44:16,100 --> 01:44:21,940
in the trading floor I just like to add

1758
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:26,570
about the business side of it the

1759
01:44:21,940 --> 01:44:29,410
legislation has always been secondary to

1760
01:44:26,570 --> 01:44:32,179
technologies in the history of humankind

1761
01:44:29,410 --> 01:44:36,680
trying to formalize the relationships

1762
01:44:32,180 --> 01:44:42,650
that have already emerged now the

1763
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:48,050
legislators are trying to get faster to

1764
01:44:42,650 --> 01:44:51,080
move faster than the developers I'm

1765
01:44:48,050 --> 01:44:53,330
referring to the American European X

1766
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:57,650
experience and I think in this

1767
01:44:53,330 --> 01:45:00,309
particular case algorithms will lose the

1768
01:44:57,650 --> 01:45:03,259
game because many algorithms that

1769
01:45:00,310 --> 01:45:08,870
Europeans are using will not be applied

1770
01:45:03,260 --> 01:45:13,640
why should I be M allow other dr. Watson

1771
01:45:08,870 --> 01:45:16,760
to treat European patients if it goes

1772
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:18,680
against their legislation exactly we

1773
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:20,990
have we still have about ten minutes and

1774
01:45:18,680 --> 01:45:24,350
you can ask questions are there any

1775
01:45:20,990 --> 01:45:26,950
questions from the floor all right yeah

1776
01:45:24,350 --> 01:45:26,950
I got a question

1777
01:45:31,690 --> 01:45:34,820
colleagues firstly thank you for your

1778
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:36,800
presentations

1779
01:45:34,820 --> 01:45:38,780
I had a great pleasure listening to you

1780
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:39,710
my name is Alexander my question is

1781
01:45:38,780 --> 01:45:43,009
quite brief

1782
01:45:39,710 --> 01:45:45,850
what's your experts opinion is the

1783
01:45:43,010 --> 01:45:49,489
society ready for such a growth of

1784
01:45:45,850 --> 01:45:53,739
digitization how does it perceive it and

1785
01:45:49,489 --> 01:45:58,459
other any difficulties in terms of every

1786
01:45:53,739 --> 01:46:00,739
member of the society so and immediately

1787
01:45:58,460 --> 01:46:05,270
the second question if you see and

1788
01:46:00,739 --> 01:46:08,540
understand how to fight it what tools do

1789
01:46:05,270 --> 01:46:10,910
you use to bring across the value how do

1790
01:46:08,540 --> 01:46:13,790
you motivate the citizens who would like

1791
01:46:10,910 --> 01:46:15,530
to become digital thank you I will start

1792
01:46:13,790 --> 01:46:16,810
answering and then pass the floor to my

1793
01:46:15,530 --> 01:46:22,309
colleagues

1794
01:46:16,810 --> 01:46:26,300
the point is that discussions regarding

1795
01:46:22,310 --> 01:46:30,380
the society moving fast too fast or too

1796
01:46:26,300 --> 01:46:33,950
slow or doesn't go there at all is just

1797
01:46:30,380 --> 01:46:37,870
like asking a mountain climber why are

1798
01:46:33,950 --> 01:46:42,700
they going to fly the Everest there's

1799
01:46:37,870 --> 01:46:42,700
nothing that the air is to fill there

1800
01:46:43,390 --> 01:46:51,580
one guy said let's destroy all the power

1801
01:46:48,980 --> 01:46:54,950
grids there are only 600 and worldwide

1802
01:46:51,580 --> 01:46:57,080
because going developing digital

1803
01:46:54,950 --> 01:47:01,550
technologies and using high technology

1804
01:46:57,080 --> 01:47:05,239
is basically about David's works the

1805
01:47:01,550 --> 01:47:09,080
world is still moving forward within

1806
01:47:05,239 --> 01:47:12,169
this paradigm today billions of credit

1807
01:47:09,080 --> 01:47:14,739
card users use these services and their

1808
01:47:12,170 --> 01:47:18,469
billions and billions of users of other

1809
01:47:14,739 --> 01:47:21,799
services so it's a huge majority of the

1810
01:47:18,469 --> 01:47:23,810
world and they're all moving this

1811
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:26,270
direction and the second question asked

1812
01:47:23,810 --> 01:47:30,950
my colleagues to take it's an exciting

1813
01:47:26,270 --> 01:47:33,429
question you know there's a fable Moses

1814
01:47:30,950 --> 01:47:39,370
took 40 years

1815
01:47:33,429 --> 01:47:41,920
to Leeds Jews in the desert it can take

1816
01:47:39,370 --> 01:47:45,730
just four months well you know this for

1817
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:52,630
14 generations to change yes

1818
01:47:45,730 --> 01:47:55,059
actually a person get the core that

1819
01:47:52,630 --> 01:47:57,730
develops in the early childhood there's

1820
01:47:55,060 --> 01:48:01,120
a theory that your life scenario is

1821
01:47:57,730 --> 01:48:04,209
actually determining the force first six

1822
01:48:01,120 --> 01:48:06,250
years of your life so take a look at

1823
01:48:04,210 --> 01:48:08,890
current people so there was no

1824
01:48:06,250 --> 01:48:13,810
technology several hundred years ago a

1825
01:48:08,890 --> 01:48:15,909
person would get born and would not know

1826
01:48:13,810 --> 01:48:18,010
anything new until the end of their

1827
01:48:15,909 --> 01:48:20,949
lives now things are changing very fast

1828
01:48:18,010 --> 01:48:24,820
this cycle is very short of course and

1829
01:48:20,949 --> 01:48:26,860
digital is going to penetrate where it's

1830
01:48:24,820 --> 01:48:28,989
needed but human mentality doesn't

1831
01:48:26,860 --> 01:48:31,540
change so fast so maybe this will be the

1832
01:48:28,989 --> 01:48:35,889
reason why several generations will need

1833
01:48:31,540 --> 01:48:38,949
to change and even the generation of our

1834
01:48:35,890 --> 01:48:44,260
children who get born with gadgets and

1835
01:48:38,949 --> 01:48:46,900
phones will be more susceptible and then

1836
01:48:44,260 --> 01:48:51,060
there's a question how they how should

1837
01:48:46,900 --> 01:48:55,019
we make sure that they don't lose the

1838
01:48:51,060 --> 01:48:59,199
human essence while ago as digital

1839
01:48:55,020 --> 01:49:02,080
radomir my second question to you will

1840
01:48:59,199 --> 01:49:06,250
Microsoft any other major IT company

1841
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:10,440
they motivate people to go digital I can

1842
01:49:06,250 --> 01:49:14,949
tell you that nobody motivates us I

1843
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:16,780
actually explained it so if you had my

1844
01:49:14,949 --> 01:49:18,809
presentation maybe you just entered the

1845
01:49:16,780 --> 01:49:23,590
room late I just wouldn't like to repeat

1846
01:49:18,810 --> 01:49:25,750
but taking your question those of us who

1847
01:49:23,590 --> 01:49:28,210
are not motivated for this and doesn't

1848
01:49:25,750 --> 01:49:31,510
see the future without digital

1849
01:49:28,210 --> 01:49:33,550
technologists so it's a natural you know

1850
01:49:31,510 --> 01:49:35,520
requirement for the employer otherwise

1851
01:49:33,550 --> 01:49:38,650
they just won't be able to work because

1852
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:40,270
this is the way it works in my company I

1853
01:49:38,650 --> 01:49:43,509
think I've taken the question after

1854
01:49:40,270 --> 01:49:46,360
more than that I'll add that as of today

1855
01:49:43,510 --> 01:49:48,910
especially in the learnings and

1856
01:49:46,360 --> 01:49:51,610
education process to motivate well

1857
01:49:48,910 --> 01:49:54,490
believe me look today if a question has

1858
01:49:51,610 --> 01:49:58,719
been asked and by the way it's an

1859
01:49:54,490 --> 01:50:01,300
opinion expressed in the polls so when

1860
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:05,500
they pull schoolchildren so they want to

1861
01:50:01,300 --> 01:50:07,840
become so number two position now what's

1862
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:10,660
a stable stable is to become a

1863
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:13,840
programmer software developer for a very

1864
01:50:10,660 --> 01:50:17,860
simple reason today there are some

1865
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:20,820
economic trends to do that and the

1866
01:50:17,860 --> 01:50:24,849
entire information environment

1867
01:50:20,820 --> 01:50:30,960
continuously motivates us to say that we

1868
01:50:24,850 --> 01:50:36,270
need to work in the digital technologies

1869
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:41,020
another addition for our IP colleagues

1870
01:50:36,270 --> 01:50:45,310
over the past two years the image of an

1871
01:50:41,020 --> 01:50:47,670
absolutely analog professions has

1872
01:50:45,310 --> 01:50:53,470
absolutely changed take a theater actor

1873
01:50:47,670 --> 01:50:57,490
or a movie directors now in both

1874
01:50:53,470 --> 01:51:03,280
Hollywood and China there is absolutely

1875
01:50:57,490 --> 01:51:06,250
similar classes for acting and directing

1876
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:09,730
for YouTube absolutely different things

1877
01:51:06,250 --> 01:51:13,260
so what affected that the digital

1878
01:51:09,730 --> 01:51:15,759
technology did because had it not been

1879
01:51:13,260 --> 01:51:18,130
demanded by the society everything would

1880
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:24,450
have stayed the same level can I add I

1881
01:51:18,130 --> 01:51:24,450
just want to say that human is the only

1882
01:51:25,410 --> 01:51:34,840
creation of the world that gets born and

1883
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:36,969
completes brain becomes complete after

1884
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:40,000
the birth and the neuroplasticity

1885
01:51:36,970 --> 01:51:41,350
mechanism allows us modifying until the

1886
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:43,570
very end of our lives

1887
01:51:41,350 --> 01:51:46,000
so basically adaptation capabilities are

1888
01:51:43,570 --> 01:51:48,099
open throughout the life which means

1889
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:53,590
that humans can adapt to any challenges

1890
01:51:48,100 --> 01:51:55,330
and I see today how people stop seeing a

1891
01:51:53,590 --> 01:51:58,900
threat in digital technologies and

1892
01:51:55,330 --> 01:52:01,769
that's great because it's exactly the

1893
01:51:58,900 --> 01:52:04,589
digital technologies that open up

1894
01:52:01,770 --> 01:52:08,620
opportunities for speed and scale

1895
01:52:04,590 --> 01:52:11,200
digital technologies offer us access to

1896
01:52:08,620 --> 01:52:13,330
other markets it's exactly a thanks sir

1897
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:15,250
to digital technologies that every act

1898
01:52:13,330 --> 01:52:18,040
that can produce themselves including

1899
01:52:15,250 --> 01:52:19,870
YouTube this expands the horizons and

1900
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:21,850
people are prepared for that and when

1901
01:52:19,870 --> 01:52:25,920
they see the value you can't imagine

1902
01:52:21,850 --> 01:52:30,700
I have seen an actor who was 56 and they

1903
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:33,310
were mastering YouTube in just a few

1904
01:52:30,700 --> 01:52:36,610
hours because they knew that if they can

1905
01:52:33,310 --> 01:52:39,820
post their videos they can sell their

1906
01:52:36,610 --> 01:52:44,589
acting capability and once they

1907
01:52:39,820 --> 01:52:47,380
understand great huge energy I get some

1908
01:52:44,590 --> 01:52:50,350
taps and so there's nothing impossible

1909
01:52:47,380 --> 01:52:52,450
for a person of intelligence a great a

1910
01:52:50,350 --> 01:52:58,570
concluding statement I just like to add

1911
01:52:52,450 --> 01:53:03,130
about digital just in case you know when

1912
01:52:58,570 --> 01:53:05,559
we say digital it's about enumeration

1913
01:53:03,130 --> 01:53:09,070
system but in fact computers are reverse

1914
01:53:05,560 --> 01:53:11,110
eros and once it's a great happiness to

1915
01:53:09,070 --> 01:53:13,210
a worth more than the zeros and ones

1916
01:53:11,110 --> 01:53:15,460
zeros and ones are not very future

1917
01:53:13,210 --> 01:53:18,400
matrix has already stated that thank you

1918
01:53:15,460 --> 01:53:20,880
very much and that concludes round table

1919
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:20,879
thank you
