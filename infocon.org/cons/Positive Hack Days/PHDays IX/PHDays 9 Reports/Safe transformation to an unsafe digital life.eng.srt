1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:10,110
so let us talk today we are going to

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,460
talk about the future our subject and

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,959
current conditions I think this

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,529
conversation is very interesting because

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:20,430
I think that we have a strange situation

6
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:23,789
here we have half room who believed

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,650
offenders and built system of defense

8
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:29,609
other half understand that they can

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:33,199
easily hack them spending some time and

10
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:36,410
efforts this paradigm believe and

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,410
discuss that

12
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:43,559
my name is persimmons

13
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:46,949
this is one of the organizers of this

14
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:59,968
forum and his conscience together with

15
00:00:46,949 --> 00:01:06,119
me we will have an Mandarin is shortened

16
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:13,319
Russian Railways and Harold is long time

17
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:16,590
heading large blocks show just security

18
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:21,659
but functioning our currency it has a

19
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:26,280
strategic view on how to build right see

20
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:30,600
and he'll bring he'll bring his part in

21
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:35,399
tower talk alexander baranov deputy head

22
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:38,479
of IT security in High School of

23
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:41,639
Economics so those

24
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,639
[Music]

25
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:49,640
he doesn't need to be introduced so I

26
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,550
think that informational security and

27
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:55,150
industry that we have in Russia

28
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:58,580
including methodological support

29
00:01:55,150 --> 00:02:02,810
approach people and practices in many

30
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:05,840
ways were built by mr. Barajas eagle

31
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:08,840
upon off vice-president of Ross telecom

32
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:15,500
in my own front I'm glad that he's

33
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:19,820
joined us has a huge experience

34
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:22,430
he worked in different positions he was

35
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:29,989
and the great event the consultants

36
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:32,570
client and now he has a lot of tasks on

37
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:35,870
building large-scale projects on the

38
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:38,359
level of the government and it would be

39
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:42,160
great to listen to him so colleagues

40
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,270
body format we have HD we welcome any

41
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:49,840
dialogue with the audience

42
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:53,990
if some buddy has any questions thoughts

43
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,880
ideas please send up as questions we

44
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:58,550
have mics we are going to give them to

45
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,950
you and you will have a dialogue not

46
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,390
necessarily waiting for the end of the

47
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:05,000
session if there is something to say

48
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,109
just raise your hand and I'll hold you

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:14,300
to the mic okay

50
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:17,870
so let's start first question look look

51
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:20,690
at that you know that there are many

52
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:24,230
incidents and their number is growing

53
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:31,370
not getting less to say that system of

54
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:35,530
IT security is something resolved it's

55
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:40,480
the wrong thing to say it is still valid

56
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:40,480
90 systems we bring this approach

57
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:50,239
we built smart houses smart governments

58
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:54,140
and this issue this challenge is

59
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:56,660
spreading from computers to the rest of

60
00:03:54,140 --> 00:04:00,890
our lives and the question to colleagues

61
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:03,590
how do you evaluate this how do how can

62
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:06,679
I say what can I say about this current

63
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:07,910
situation what can I do to change the

64
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,140
current paradigm when everybody

65
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:15,109
understands that the system can be

66
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:21,589
hacked Harold let's start from you hello

67
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:23,780
colleagues to change something rapidly

68
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:29,060
in strongly you need to project

69
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:32,630
computers and it's not possible in

70
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:36,860
current situation well look the way I

71
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:39,830
see it from my experience I've been

72
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,840
working in different critical IT

73
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:49,930
infrastructures being power sex and our

74
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:49,929
railways everywhere it is about the same

75
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:59,060
mainly we are using systems which are

76
00:04:54,410 --> 00:05:02,930
not built into our platforms or

77
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:08,540
solutions we do IT security later

78
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:12,370
looks like buying a Lada in 1990s why

79
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:16,300
the cars and then you run something

80
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:20,800
somewhere to buy new wheels new radio

81
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:23,530
labels so you don't buy something

82
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,780
complete

83
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:30,340
so the trends are the speed is growing

84
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:37,109
complexities are growing integration is

85
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:42,250
growing big time interdependencies I'll

86
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:47,520
appear a lot even SMS message that comes

87
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:53,200
in time is the component of complex

88
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:58,090
services so our interdependencies gets

89
00:05:53,200 --> 00:06:01,080
stronger same as feedback and different

90
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:08,909
hygiene levels in all of these

91
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:12,370
components of the service chain and

92
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:14,860
we're kind of going to abyss unless we

93
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:20,310
start approaching in a comprehensive way

94
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:22,750
to security and design from within one

95
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:25,000
company and organization is not possible

96
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:28,090
we need to talk about the mechanisms

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,830
that unite us that's all I can say so

98
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:33,630
far let me give a floor to a colleague

99
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:36,460
you know I think that we need to

100
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:41,560
principally change the psychology of

101
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:45,580
those who produce the security IT

102
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:48,880
security hardware I've worked with many

103
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:52,359
producers and to say that the IT

104
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,909
security must be operated by specialists

105
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,600
is wrong although it looks like right

106
00:06:54,910 --> 00:07:03,190
although the massive IT security

107
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:05,380
envisages to use the means and tools

108
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:07,570
like plug and play so the must be built

109
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:09,909
into the systems that are operated by

110
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:11,830
our mothers grandmothers and

111
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:16,210
grandfathers because they take the

112
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:21,010
phones look inside just take a look who

113
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:24,370
has antivirus in the smartphone the best

114
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:26,409
case 10% maybe less among you why

115
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:29,360
because it's difficult and the systems

116
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:32,639
must be very simple

117
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,900
easy to operate hard to produce I

118
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,879
understand but unless we change the

119
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:57,030
psychology we will never be able to

120
00:07:35,879 --> 00:08:01,949
establish massive IT security my point

121
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:07,289
of view quite strongly we see changed

122
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:11,580
paradigm our t security if five years

123
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:15,419
ago IT security was based in a classic

124
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:21,240
way at first we had it in the right way

125
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:25,729
first we had the risk analysis wrote the

126
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:28,349
terms of reference designed purchased

127
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:33,270
implemented tested and then we have the

128
00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:36,240
IT security system custom bronze and now

129
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:40,260
the modern landscape of internal changes

130
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:44,700
within our organization and external

131
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:47,579
changes is that time of response time of

132
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:51,529
responding to changes is reducing not

133
00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:54,359
today's but rather to hours if you are

134
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:58,529
observing the way how the darknet is

135
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:01,800
developing and acting fields you can

136
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:05,640
notice that from the moment of having a

137
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:09,630
vulnerability published or raised up in

138
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:12,800
darknet until this vulnerability is

139
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:16,350
exploited during attack we have days

140
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,540
recent example when they found the

141
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,130
vulnerability in Windows and exactly

142
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,740
within one of the holidays this

143
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,950
vulnerability is used in malware of

144
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:29,320
Cobalt

145
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:33,010
this is very serious sign an indicator

146
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:35,550
that external landscape and dynamics and

147
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:38,920
trends of external environment is

148
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:42,880
growing if you watch our C's published

149
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:49,779
last week that could be used in attacks

150
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:52,779
of similar I wanna try of 2017 the time

151
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:55,480
a response I don't know how much time

152
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:59,320
you were passing your IT to close this

153
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:03,940
vulnerability this must be done during

154
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:06,010
hours not even days so the advance of

155
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,959
external environment that classic

156
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:11,079
approach to providing IT security

157
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:14,680
doesn't give this effect in the second

158
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:16,959
half is changing the trends within their

159
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:21,130
organization number of new releases that

160
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:25,899
your I t's people roll out number of new

161
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:28,089
versions new number of new hosts IP

162
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:32,050
addresses that appear at the perimeter

163
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:38,380
per day is such that security must turn

164
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:43,209
from what static structure that works as

165
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:47,470
I described in a model of creating the

166
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:52,359
fence which is hard to crawl over into a

167
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:56,170
system of responding to changes the IT

168
00:10:52,360 --> 00:11:00,160
security model IT security servers must

169
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:04,479
be as such that system must see the

170
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:07,719
changes it must see them inside outside

171
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,180
and must effectively respond to them and

172
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,649
this paradigm is changing the whole

173
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:14,079
logical structure from the

174
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:20,339
organizational point of view when

175
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:20,339
providing the security and here the

176
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:32,060
first priority and focus well it is

177
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:35,850
called IT security ability to detect

178
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:40,939
ability to see an only then ability to

179
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:43,890
respond and I fully agree with you Boras

180
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:47,040
approach that any system could be hacked

181
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:49,800
and will be hacked is right is right LAN

182
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:53,640
depth of penetration of attack speed of

183
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:57,859
detection speed of response will be

184
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,860
defined and determined by the quality of

185
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:32,550
agree with you need to change a paradigm

186
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:36,050
we will protect and then we can detect

187
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:40,199
the paradigm and Harold Alexander

188
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:44,130
another question if you take a chi

189
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:48,810
system do you have security people and

190
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:52,560
they say the system we cannot protect

191
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:55,890
your system but we can guarantee certain

192
00:12:52,560 --> 00:13:02,069
detection and not at once how would you

193
00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:06,290
treat that this paradigm question

194
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:08,730
strange like something like we all die

195
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:10,529
you this is going to be problem I

196
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:13,529
understood the question right okay the

197
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:16,310
security people come and say and say

198
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:21,170
dear colleague

199
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:24,339
I cannot build a wall to protect you but

200
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:27,290
they can install a system which might

201
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:32,809
detect that we are hacked and we'll help

202
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:37,639
you to fix the hack but we cannot build

203
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:43,670
you the defense wall what can I say

204
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:47,059
I live with that sure more most people

205
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:49,610
live with that but we need to discuss

206
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:51,559
the situation differently what could be

207
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:55,309
done to have different types of

208
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:57,680
conversations but me what must be done

209
00:13:55,309 --> 00:13:59,839
to have different types of conversations

210
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:08,719
not that you are told that you are sick

211
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:10,670
after you sick it can scavenge and get

212
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:15,290
treated by doctors or you can eat

213
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:18,170
healthy food and be healthy so it all

214
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:21,829
starts differently we need we need to

215
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:26,979
build insecurity into platforms that we

216
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:31,430
all want to do under the digitalization

217
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:35,139
forests revolution and we need to have

218
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:39,229
mechanisms including the government once

219
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:42,230
you might have those not the ones we

220
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:44,779
have now but something you which allow

221
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:50,750
to track the security on the government

222
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:55,339
level because let me tell you something

223
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:57,740
from some corporations and companies the

224
00:14:55,339 --> 00:15:02,230
seat from different angle but if there

225
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:02,230
is a massive attack core vulnerability

226
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:07,770
there must be project solutions which

227
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:10,470
allow you to restore a system in the

228
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:16,650
required time for the country in

229
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:18,840
particular in particular is vulnerable

230
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:23,400
infrastructure but I think we need to go

231
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:25,940
the following priorities government is

232
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:28,829
also IT system which is quite large

233
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:34,680
under any technical system there must be

234
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:36,750
a general designer and such people must

235
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,239
manage requirements in particular

236
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:41,430
security requirements and there must be

237
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,540
very clear mechanisms about how the

238
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:48,239
systems are designed not in terms of

239
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:52,140
securing the perimeter including patches

240
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:55,560
and vulnerabilities but how to provide

241
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:57,780
for required restoration time and how to

242
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,510
fit within certain economic parameters

243
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:05,130
because you can make very expensive and

244
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:07,860
not effective system for business or

245
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:10,410
solution for a business then you need to

246
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:12,270
go down enduring design of platform

247
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:15,770
especially in large corporation if you

248
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:21,800
take into account systems which are

249
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:24,870
provided by community or government or

250
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:29,160
intergovernmental organizations like

251
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:32,670
Asian Pacific Economic Association and

252
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:36,420
then approach from control not like we

253
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:42,270
are given something and we do something

254
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:45,449
avoid irresponsibility and from that we

255
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:48,000
will have collective requirement

256
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:50,910
management we don't have them now but

257
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,730
maybe we'll have them from that we will

258
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:56,819
have different requirements to personnel

259
00:16:53,730 --> 00:17:02,490
and organization that can work the same

260
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:06,060
way for example a surgeon will not be

261
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:07,490
allowed to make surgery if the person

262
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:11,839
has no

263
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:16,160
is not qualified in surgery no but we

264
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:20,448
can do that in in tenders and bits in

265
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,550
procedures or whatever right yes if I'm

266
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:27,220
saying something wrong please correct me

267
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:30,800
I'm a practitioner I say what I live

268
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:36,380
like the analogy with the doctor if you

269
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:39,169
want to have my teeth fixed

270
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:42,470
I'm not going to announce a tender or a

271
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:45,260
bid I would probably choose a dentist by

272
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:51,650
different criteria but in I see security

273
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:54,679
is more complex approach I would be even

274
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:56,540
more cynical if you have just insurance

275
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:59,900
you will go where the insurance

276
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:01,670
recommends you and then you choose whom

277
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:07,820
you trust but if you have enough money

278
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:12,740
you will go to a dentist that somebody

279
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:15,200
else advised you it's not the point that

280
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:19,790
one is more effective but others but I

281
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:22,160
think private business can do whatever

282
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:26,000
they can but government know they have

283
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:31,960
some insurance it could be more

284
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:34,820
predictable and trusted and then I guess

285
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,000
including into system must be of better

286
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:42,110
quality and then it will be racing right

287
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:45,010
and we won't have any blackouts with the

288
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:47,570
proper level of personnel training

289
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:51,920
collective security etcetera that's my

290
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:57,080
approach thank you thank you that's what

291
00:18:51,920 --> 00:19:00,860
I want to say questions you asked what

292
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:05,449
you are asking is about a postal Erick I

293
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:07,909
tease after something happened we

294
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:10,600
discover what happened and you monitor

295
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:13,270
and then you discover this and that

296
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:17,969
and then what should be after that me

297
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:20,639
after that must be revenge of two types

298
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:27,430
to a system which must be modernized

299
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:34,720
toward the incident and then it must be

300
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:37,900
against the one who did it with the

301
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:42,400
first you can do something but to make

302
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:45,940
this retaliation against the source is a

303
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,830
big problem so the source could be

304
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:51,340
producer of system could be remote

305
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:55,360
hacker and you can track him to the next

306
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:58,000
provider and then now and thirdly which

307
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,610
is most interesting a system of

308
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:05,440
documentation do you think you can

309
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:09,479
manage to punish the source even it is

310
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:13,630
inside who created the preconditions for

311
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:23,140
incident so despite of having a science

312
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:24,220
I think it's called forensics recording

313
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:28,660
computer problems

314
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:32,550
so despite all forensics it is in a very

315
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:35,980
early stage that's why the retaliation

316
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:39,070
retaliation is a very rare thing and

317
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:44,100
without it nothing will work this way

318
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:48,250
I was a posteriori defense despite of

319
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:53,919
looking very effective and it is only

320
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:56,350
postpone a large-scale system who can

321
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:59,620
protect Java I'm asking who can make it

322
00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:04,059
they say no no no no it snowgo might not

323
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:07,718
do what I can

324
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:16,049
is the imposed from top the defense

325
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:19,599
perimeter but it is said the way that

326
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:21,099
the why later must be retaliated but try

327
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:23,739
to do something about the source which

328
00:21:21,099 --> 00:21:27,549
is outside of Russia probably you can do

329
00:21:23,739 --> 00:21:31,419
nothing so Harold is talking about a new

330
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:34,690
approach what I'm afraid in these

331
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:39,669
phrases I'm afraid to come up with ideal

332
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:42,279
models which then are stumbled with some

333
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:43,719
ground to earth problems like president

334
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:46,599
of the company or a bank or the

335
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:49,599
country's say Eretz everything is clear

336
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:54,249
in IT security and they believe it is

337
00:21:49,599 --> 00:22:02,499
clear but then somebody is using

338
00:21:54,249 --> 00:22:08,379
unpatched rural perimeters eager McKean

339
00:22:02,499 --> 00:22:12,759
bigger is going to leave us soon why

340
00:22:08,379 --> 00:22:20,049
would you give now what to do here now

341
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:22,210
to avoid such problems in our life can I

342
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:24,820
jump off your previous question when a

343
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:26,950
security guys comes and says I cannot

344
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:30,070
protect you well I think that's a

345
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:32,710
fantastic model because if we are

346
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:37,718
talking about some large-scale companies

347
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:40,629
and corporations leave according to a

348
00:22:37,719 --> 00:22:44,499
plan more or less they can guarantee

349
00:22:40,629 --> 00:22:48,459
that in the moment when they launch a

350
00:22:44,499 --> 00:22:51,549
new IT systems at least IT officer would

351
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:54,999
be asked hey brother can you protect us

352
00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:57,680
but now mainly the companies that work

353
00:22:54,999 --> 00:23:00,980
in the competitive environment they have

354
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:05,660
a different business strategy constant

355
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:07,850
changes rate changes which are built in

356
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:11,960
business model and competitive advantage

357
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:14,060
in most of cases the security officer

358
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:17,060
does doesn't even learn about the

359
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:20,120
initiatives not just security officers

360
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:24,580
even IT people may not know about it

361
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:28,729
and there is a massive shadow IT when

362
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:30,679
businesses do something spontaneously to

363
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:37,270
check a certain business hypothesis and

364
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:40,100
down it is launched it is failed so I

365
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:43,580
spoke with the colleague in the previous

366
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:47,480
forum and he said initiation of new

367
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:53,360
project lawyers and security officers

368
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:55,400
are so boring they say you cannot do

369
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,100
nothing okay

370
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:02,740
they made the decision when a project is

371
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:09,679
initiated or started don't call them and

372
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:14,540
I think this is the would be good to

373
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:16,730
call users to avoid users yes so I think

374
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:20,720
that's the fault of security people

375
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:24,350
because they cannot talk they can either

376
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,540
frighten or prohibit and this is a

377
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:31,129
problem he has the main argument when

378
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:35,530
the security officer is no arguments

379
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:35,530
they say what office

380
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:46,870
regulator of course and that's so our

381
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:51,770
approach of security officers through

382
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:54,199
bringing us into of sick folk worked for

383
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:59,960
the first 20 years and the folks started

384
00:24:54,200 --> 00:25:04,790
to in getting the souls and now people

385
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:06,730
start asking why people understand there

386
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:08,810
are certain tactics lettuce patch

387
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:12,050
operation systems that'll change

388
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:14,389
passwords let us bring up the users and

389
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:20,600
raise the users but there is more

390
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:24,530
strategic approach when you like a

391
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:27,500
phrase as business partner a security

392
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:29,500
officer who works in the company must

393
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:32,420
understand what the company is doing

394
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:35,480
what is the source of revenue what is

395
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:38,510
the competitive environment and what

396
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:42,740
digital tools it is planning to use what

397
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:45,230
I teach tools if the security officer

398
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:48,260
has no understanding of the partnership

399
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:50,420
it will not go anywhere as soon as they

400
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:52,790
understand what the company is doing of

401
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:56,450
course they'll find ways and tools which

402
00:25:52,790 --> 00:26:01,760
are available today but to make sure

403
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:07,280
that the security in the mouth just wrap

404
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:15,379
and run it must go away did you have in

405
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:20,350
a real case like for example we find out

406
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:23,600
that internet bank could be hacked and

407
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:27,439
withdraw money with the script greater

408
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:31,250
vulnerability whom we tell about it

409
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,940
to a security officer so he is afraid to

410
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:35,190
tell about it too

411
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:38,549
bosses because he's afraid the punished

412
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:39,149
but not telling she will not fix

413
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:41,908
anything

414
00:26:39,149 --> 00:26:42,928
Andrew say come on go and sale what is

415
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:48,179
the problem

416
00:26:42,929 --> 00:26:53,549
so and the guy is kind of stretching me

417
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:57,659
out not knowing what to do what would be

418
00:26:53,549 --> 00:27:02,549
your advice to such people to do in this

419
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:06,239
situation worse i can say that i had an

420
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:07,859
experience of finding myself in this

421
00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:10,289
situation one of the largest banks

422
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:14,309
almost the largest one everybody

423
00:27:10,289 --> 00:27:22,889
understand what is say they bring a

424
00:27:14,309 --> 00:27:25,769
paper which says personal data would be

425
00:27:22,889 --> 00:27:28,529
open you transferred never protected and

426
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:30,389
the bank should do whatever you want

427
00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:33,179
which is the legal value of this paper

428
00:27:30,389 --> 00:27:35,699
zero which normally the users are forced

429
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:41,309
to sign it i address the security of us

430
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:44,609
and say listen he said I've never seen

431
00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:47,700
this paper and then he comes up and is

432
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:50,210
actually the security officer will never

433
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:54,019
go against the consciousness and not

434
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:58,169
report about vulnerability he runs

435
00:27:54,019 --> 00:28:00,629
reports maybe this paper will be changed

436
00:27:58,169 --> 00:28:05,070
I mean the text actually assigned it

437
00:28:00,629 --> 00:28:10,709
myself knowing that the legal value is

438
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:12,928
now others also signed it that's our

439
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:16,099
approach nothing you can do means the

440
00:28:12,929 --> 00:28:19,470
true information on security IT security

441
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:21,570
IT security people do not brought to

442
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:25,019
that how to make sure that he is in

443
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:27,470
charge he understands here he's aware I

444
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:29,759
agree with digger that security

445
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:31,619
participants must be participants of

446
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:34,229
business process I can give you a lot of

447
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:38,488
examples and the security officers must

448
00:28:34,229 --> 00:28:41,099
correct their activity even positive

449
00:28:38,489 --> 00:28:42,200
attitude to regulator and even forced to

450
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:50,178
correct

451
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:54,690
decisions they make across the regulator

452
00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:58,799
sometimes regulator get adopted change

453
00:28:54,690 --> 00:29:03,000
their mind but to say that the security

454
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:07,530
officer would be frightened not to go up

455
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:11,340
to the boss that's not the true security

456
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:14,629
officer I haven't met such people to be

457
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,629
honest with you okay

458
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:27,150
yeah no you're not talk what an

459
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:28,830
interesting turn of our conversation let

460
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:36,120
me first tell you about the general

461
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:37,460
system of things if you make the system

462
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,870
right it must be more reflective

463
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:44,880
reflective than environment second rule

464
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:47,039
of cybernetics management is better than

465
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,070
manageable and with this approach it

466
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:52,350
means that during the design our future

467
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:53,820
I'm not talking about the present we can

468
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:55,918
jump a lot with the present and

469
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:58,500
everything will end up with people I

470
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,360
disagree with the colleagues security

471
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:06,120
people who don't care what they do

472
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:07,949
I've seen them too let me you say yeah

473
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:11,489
it's not relevant to the places I've

474
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:15,179
worked things god it's fine with

475
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:21,059
railways but always at the end of this

476
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:23,970
chains are people fleeing maybe they

477
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:26,850
don't do the work well it happens in

478
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:32,190
other places in medicine or in service

479
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:33,629
stations with the people who repair cars

480
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:37,730
yeah it's real life

481
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:41,039
we live not in an ideal world but not

482
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:42,659
ideal world could be repaired but a good

483
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,900
proper management system if you're

484
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:49,050
saying that we need to

485
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:51,420
system especially it's quite large the

486
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:55,970
quality of this management system and if

487
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:58,940
it's reflection must be higher or

488
00:30:55,970 --> 00:31:00,570
comparable with the challenges of

489
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:04,020
surrounding world

490
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:09,540
I gave you an analogy with medicine or

491
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:11,340
the rescue services that they know they

492
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:13,889
will save somebody in the forest or

493
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:17,669
ambulance will come firemen will

494
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:19,980
extinguish a fire and in IT world we

495
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:23,360
need to build the same system which is

496
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:26,160
not made in other places of the world

497
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,139
but so far we don't have it building of

498
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:31,170
such system our current conditions is

499
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:33,800
quite difficult agreement between the

500
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:36,390
government active participants because

501
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:38,460
all will be participants of this

502
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:41,690
resource service model one way or

503
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:44,970
another could be maybe similar to

504
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:46,740
insurance companies if they connect

505
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:48,920
economic approach there could be some

506
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:51,690
engineering models but we need to

507
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:54,840
discuss in details but we need to raise

508
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:58,800
this issue just to as a food for thought

509
00:31:54,840 --> 00:32:01,760
let us thing applicable to what happens

510
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:05,690
with people when the current situation a

511
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:09,270
system which could repair the general

512
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:09,990
background I think it's not sufficiently

513
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:12,270
well made

514
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:17,970
we need the place to grow there could be

515
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:20,060
any options the security officer got

516
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:25,950
scared he got late

517
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:29,250
something got unpitched so and now we're

518
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:32,940
talking about the future let's talk

519
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:35,670
about models both Harold starts to talk

520
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:38,430
about I gave this example many times I

521
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:42,630
liked the idea of almost a philosopher

522
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:45,780
who said actually when people lived in

523
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:48,720
villages they didn't know they needed no

524
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:51,559
locks no police if I was stolen public

525
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:56,240
neighbor I'll find the guy

526
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:58,700
people moved into houses towns my dad

527
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:04,299
looks police other security measures and

528
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:07,580
Internet is like a big city together

529
00:33:04,299 --> 00:33:14,539
Americans Chinese who can work for a

530
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:18,889
bowl of rice per day our co-citizens who

531
00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:21,710
are very smart and this is a combination

532
00:33:18,889 --> 00:33:23,748
of people and we must have new

533
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:26,570
approaches and mechanisms and we never

534
00:33:23,749 --> 00:33:29,809
had them before let us think what these

535
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:31,399
mechanisms could be I will talk in three

536
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:35,809
dimensions and the government level

537
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:38,658
business level and human level but I

538
00:33:35,809 --> 00:33:44,210
would think not just in general but

539
00:33:38,659 --> 00:33:45,799
let's say you have a possibility within

540
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:50,629
three years to offer something to the

541
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:53,509
government what would you offer anyway

542
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:57,619
brand-new approaches or mechanisms but

543
00:33:53,509 --> 00:34:01,700
you to change this poor situation with

544
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:03,379
the IT security well the first thing I

545
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:05,659
said before we need to understand

546
00:34:03,379 --> 00:34:09,319
everybody understand what there's a

547
00:34:05,659 --> 00:34:12,550
thing called massive security when we

548
00:34:09,319 --> 00:34:15,469
are talking about the security also

549
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:18,020
thousands not even hundreds of thousands

550
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:20,569
not even tens of millions but hundreds

551
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:23,869
of millions of devices that are

552
00:34:20,569 --> 00:34:30,230
available and operated and they operated

553
00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:32,629
by unqualified users so this is that

554
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:33,889
paradigm has the difference between the

555
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:36,230
city and the village ordered by the

556
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:37,970
village they have little people you can

557
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:42,230
everybody can hear everybody but in a

558
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:44,989
city a lot of people that's why big

559
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:47,569
massive it is security to put the

560
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:52,428
brightest examples of having no such IT

561
00:34:47,569 --> 00:34:54,440
security is having no good policy is

562
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:55,700
signature everybody knows that it's

563
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,369
available it is

564
00:34:55,699 --> 00:35:00,439
even been the minister but it's not the

565
00:34:58,369 --> 00:35:02,960
good quality despite of the fact that

566
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:06,410
the authorization centers are of good

567
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,760
quality why because they conditions the

568
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:12,129
for plication

569
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:15,650
on board a regular user like household

570
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:19,099
or housewife they're not matching to the

571
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:23,180
requirements which regulator brought to

572
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:28,119
this qualified a signature at the end

573
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:34,220
that's legal value of something which is

574
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:37,760
signed with this a signature is no it

575
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:40,160
could be used but could be easily argued

576
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:43,220
because the conditions are not fulfilled

577
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,450
so that's the bright example what can be

578
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:47,868
done in this case of course the

579
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:49,160
government must respond to this problems

580
00:35:47,869 --> 00:35:53,210
quicker come on

581
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:55,660
law number 64 it's been kicked back and

582
00:35:53,210 --> 00:36:00,500
forth for so long I'm very sorry I

583
00:35:55,660 --> 00:36:02,598
stopped using derogative slang against

584
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:05,329
the Ministry of Communications so I will

585
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:09,050
try not to mention them although I've

586
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:13,790
just did so low number 64 for how long

587
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:16,220
it could be it's still handwritten power

588
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:18,619
torn a pair of attorney forever but it's

589
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:23,180
secular for everything for business but

590
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:29,210
still we we have it although we have

591
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:32,960
good quality is signature and we have

592
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:36,349
two hundred thousand foster enterprises

593
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,750
that use that come on this must be a

594
00:36:36,349 --> 00:36:40,700
role to be played by the government and

595
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:43,280
we have a lot of drawbacks and this is

596
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:46,490
the third thing and this and what was

597
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:49,060
done o producers of IT security they

598
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:51,890
must understand the trend

599
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:54,410
let me repeat it's hard to develop it's

600
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:56,328
hard to develop things which are easy to

601
00:36:54,410 --> 00:37:00,430
operate because they are very complex in

602
00:36:56,329 --> 00:37:03,780
fact easy on a surface look at the

603
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:08,460
please look at the

604
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:09,630
washing machine is bad when it has 500

605
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:13,230
functions

606
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:17,970
it must have five or six which could

607
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:21,109
cover everything or be self adjusted and

608
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:24,560
be adjusted and set up in a store

609
00:37:21,109 --> 00:37:28,470
avoiding housewife to look at the

610
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:31,529
multiple pages of manual saying with our

611
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:38,970
public consciousness okay you talk about

612
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:41,069
the vendors it's not quite your subject

613
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:43,230
but you have experience working at the

614
00:37:41,069 --> 00:37:45,869
regulator if you say vendor any

615
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:48,720
competition is good directly in our

616
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:51,510
sector we have young guys made a startup

617
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:55,618
made the product but less they have a

618
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:59,960
license sensitive stratification to not

619
00:37:55,619 --> 00:38:06,050
buy them if you guys will not reach

620
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:06,050
producers so what to do our market

621
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:12,690
initiates low competition and poor

622
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:16,670
quality I agree I agree I agree I agree

623
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:20,339
that a regulator must be more flexible

624
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:26,579
if you take a look at the evolution of

625
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:28,410
regulator you may observe that look how

626
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:34,099
the ADEs

627
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:39,710
center of National Security Service is

628
00:38:34,099 --> 00:38:39,710
developing but there's not enough even

629
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:48,209
CC one cannot function what to do we

630
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:54,060
need to find CC zero and this is the

631
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:57,000
desire for a regulator regulator leads

632
00:38:54,060 --> 00:39:01,319
hard life for the eight years I'm

633
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:03,470
working of the regulator I've seen so

634
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:07,200
many things I could not even imagine

635
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:09,580
living outside of the fence you cannot

636
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,129
even imagine what is going on there

637
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:13,990
as one man said one of the boss one of

638
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:16,450
my former boss said some time ago

639
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:19,149
a criminal did the specifics of his

640
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:20,830
psychology can invent such thing which

641
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:23,770
will never think about I can give you

642
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:25,750
such examples which at back then would

643
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:28,930
never thought about and now I observe

644
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:31,600
them in reality and I'm forced to deal

645
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:34,990
with that yes there's there is a

646
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:39,819
phenomena what is the way out maybe to

647
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:44,649
take regulators push them to work in two

648
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:50,740
top organizations that are IT security

649
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:53,440
operators for them to see you get

650
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:56,229
experience and go back but it's very

651
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,480
difficult actually considered regulator

652
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:01,720
in stack after our section after small

653
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:03,490
break one o'clock we'll have own section

654
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,259
they want to talk with people with the

655
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:08,259
audience talked about this new

656
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:12,330
approaches on providing security so the

657
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:15,250
regulator actually I agree with you guys

658
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:17,740
understand that and they started to go

659
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:19,990
outside of the fence to talk to people

660
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:25,410
with Allie Lutz gov co-chair is a great

661
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:33,339
guy actually so one o'clock write your

662
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:36,160
thoughts and this philosophical question

663
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:37,420
on the other hand practical I want to

664
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,160
talk about two things regulators and

665
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:41,530
money regulators we have great

666
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:45,600
regulators very very good good lives

667
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:48,610
every one of them can listen talk

668
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:52,540
knowledge but then we say come on show

669
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:57,600
flexibility under very live environment

670
00:40:52,540 --> 00:41:00,880
that we have an IT and actually

671
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:04,589
adjustable is in IT regulator must not

672
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:07,689
be flexible they cannot be

673
00:41:04,589 --> 00:41:10,150
Vin's black oh there are some draft laws

674
00:41:07,689 --> 00:41:12,969
on regulating big data we have something

675
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:18,579
else one another draft law I agree with

676
00:41:12,969 --> 00:41:20,439
Alexander we're thinking out loud

677
00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:24,160
fantasizing so what is the problem now

678
00:41:20,439 --> 00:41:29,098
for us for companies that work in IT

679
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:29,098
security the problem is that now

680
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:41,469
mentally responsibility he's with us

681
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:46,180
developers companies they protect our

682
00:41:41,469 --> 00:41:49,239
data we are responsible for complying to

683
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:51,788
the norms and requirements and we're not

684
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:54,189
responsible for incidents that's the

685
00:41:51,789 --> 00:41:58,199
fundamental problem now if you take a

686
00:41:54,189 --> 00:42:02,410
look at what are the consequences

687
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:05,289
leaking of personal data consequences

688
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:06,788
for families for non-compliance to

689
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:09,429
requirements and protecting your

690
00:42:06,789 --> 00:42:12,429
personal data you're very different and

691
00:42:09,429 --> 00:42:15,099
it creates or you have created to the

692
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:20,219
market industry of protecting your data

693
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:23,019
at least protecting against regulator so

694
00:42:20,219 --> 00:42:26,199
when we have a change transition of the

695
00:42:23,019 --> 00:42:29,729
ideology when we have responsibility for

696
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:35,799
a leakage or incidents for hacks then

697
00:42:29,729 --> 00:42:38,229
the owners of these protected Malo data

698
00:42:35,799 --> 00:42:40,269
will think the results how to protect

699
00:42:38,229 --> 00:42:42,968
how to build the second system and

700
00:42:40,269 --> 00:42:46,479
finally Hawaii discover risk insurance

701
00:42:42,969 --> 00:42:50,170
and it will become even more the mantra

702
00:42:46,479 --> 00:42:53,410
by my spiritual master as a strong

703
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:56,589
economic author his protector first

704
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:59,160
let's move from responsibility on in

705
00:42:56,589 --> 00:43:02,199
compliance yours to responsibility over

706
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:09,058
incidents and IT security our second

707
00:43:02,199 --> 00:43:12,179
concern is a cost of doing

708
00:43:09,059 --> 00:43:17,130
the market will circulate when I must

709
00:43:12,179 --> 00:43:19,409
opens doors yes my opinion seriously

710
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:21,739
believe the latest most storage open

711
00:43:19,409 --> 00:43:31,679
doors are much more than you might

712
00:43:21,739 --> 00:43:33,869
uncheck to protection alleges IT

713
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:38,069
security is the expensive thing yeah

714
00:43:33,869 --> 00:43:42,289
what we don't have yet we are suffering

715
00:43:38,069 --> 00:43:45,029
you and me business or any other startup

716
00:43:42,289 --> 00:43:47,819
so they're suffering from lack of money

717
00:43:45,029 --> 00:43:50,880
unfortunately today we don't have decent

718
00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:53,279
mechanisms of inviting investments is

719
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:57,719
this enough funding of our high-tech

720
00:43:53,279 --> 00:43:58,799
developments use this example business

721
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:01,289
what I was doing I was developing

722
00:43:58,799 --> 00:44:04,499
software technologists normally cut

723
00:44:01,289 --> 00:44:10,289
minimal three year cycle I was going to

724
00:44:04,499 --> 00:44:11,729
bank your bank loan give you funding and

725
00:44:10,289 --> 00:44:14,219
then very soon we push them back bigger

726
00:44:11,729 --> 00:44:17,158
do you have a building I said no you

727
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:23,400
could Igor do you have a machine I said

728
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:26,219
I know I'd be high-tech products so off

729
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:28,439
you go with your high-tech products they

730
00:44:26,219 --> 00:44:30,539
say they're so well that's why for us

731
00:44:28,439 --> 00:44:34,049
for the companies that develop software

732
00:44:30,539 --> 00:44:37,140
and investments there's no disability

733
00:44:34,049 --> 00:44:39,799
funding mechanisms still the surfing

734
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:44,900
hard thing to say which is macro factors

735
00:44:39,799 --> 00:44:48,659
you can influence that narrow-mindedness

736
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:50,549
sodium of our market because we don't

737
00:44:48,659 --> 00:44:53,519
ask either well that works

738
00:44:50,549 --> 00:44:55,739
no the market is narrow itself market is

739
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:57,718
narrow is narrow to create before his

740
00:44:55,739 --> 00:45:01,799
brothers often you Russian developers

741
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:03,820
are blamed that guy's your product is

742
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:09,380
working bad

743
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:13,400
well user interface it has bugs whatever

744
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:15,290
I should say speaking on behalf of here

745
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:19,220
developer company yet but every next

746
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:21,950
increase of software quality power

747
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:26,569
consumption whatever sustainability

748
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:32,029
whatever ten percent of software costs

749
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:34,100
two times more in the developers get

750
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:37,180
money over the air then the question was

751
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:42,529
how many times you sell the software

752
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:47,560
almost every company I'm sure yes you're

753
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:47,560
not an exception in your strategy in

754
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:56,470
foreign New York it's just bigger more

755
00:45:53,330 --> 00:46:00,080
clients you can't get money to reinvest

756
00:45:56,470 --> 00:46:05,689
development and our problem also is that

757
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:07,670
our macro well-spaced or external and

758
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:09,620
foreign political situation of yours

759
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:11,660
does not allow us to have easy access to

760
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:21,339
foreign markets every time for every

761
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:24,170
company firstly imagine is being outside

762
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:25,910
outside so talking about changing our

763
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:27,370
landscape or some security about in

764
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:30,440
Russia three factors first

765
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:34,790
responsibility not before in compliance

766
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:39,110
button responsibility for incidents real

767
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:42,980
leaks number two it you know any funding

768
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:45,920
mechanism I can use venture investments

769
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:50,200
which are thirdly access to foreign

770
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:53,570
markets where we will get different

771
00:46:50,200 --> 00:47:00,740
larger sales market Hydra vision I have

772
00:46:53,570 --> 00:47:03,800
experience working abroad normally the

773
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:07,279
first not two three meetings or quieted

774
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:09,950
we are region called by the leader we

775
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:12,360
talked with the present of system that's

776
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:15,870
one of the largest European telecom

777
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:18,570
they first meet him second with him he's

778
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:23,310
talked to us to find out what we do in

779
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:24,570
Russia we never met big 3 although we

780
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:34,160
have a huge project

781
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:38,520
no but in Russia leaders in directories

782
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:41,970
want to talk to clients not just to read

783
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:45,090
papers as soon as you have that he took

784
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:47,959
budgets and it's all very related as

785
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:51,630
soon as security stops perceiving as

786
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:53,730
perfection but a result a person comes

787
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:58,530
to idea that something you must be done

788
00:47:53,730 --> 00:48:02,910
in a different way so that's totally

789
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:07,470
different model and market revitalizes

790
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:10,770
in this model I agree Harold's way

791
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:16,620
exhibiting your recipes of the

792
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:18,270
government level to the government in

793
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:22,650
three years time to change something in

794
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:25,050
IT security well many things were

795
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:26,690
mentioned with already what I would like

796
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:29,850
to underline

797
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:32,550
like it Co Co in pharmacy based family

798
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:36,360
you and rusty Ishmael who do simple

799
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:42,740
things restore information aggregate and

800
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:42,740
define access to this information so if

801
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:50,210
technology and the genetics of this

802
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:53,970
information at the government level mean

803
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:56,910
equally security any deviation from the

804
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:59,040
accepted ontology is the threat and

805
00:48:56,910 --> 00:49:02,129
secure itself is a very complex stage

806
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:04,110
must be discussed in ER dealing it is

807
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:06,120
not win with them Scott kniffen on you

808
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:10,260
cause certain engineer hunch that a

809
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:11,040
Newton orbit by non solution rather over

810
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:15,890
here my Lopes

811
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:18,200
let me repeat let me remind minders

812
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:21,140
my name is not sure if I should

813
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:23,118
potentially to use a different illogical

814
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:27,400
beta model because we do everything

815
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:31,279
around data worried lately with them

816
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:35,180
defining certainly says it it's

817
00:49:31,279 --> 00:49:39,950
protecting cleaning genetics of

818
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:42,019
information substantially influences

819
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:44,029
company security for example we are

820
00:49:42,019 --> 00:49:44,538
people where humans we have our three

821
00:49:44,029 --> 00:49:47,630
lawns

822
00:49:44,539 --> 00:49:51,819
no but ultimately a stay unless we keep

823
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:56,599
this genome fine we remain humans

824
00:49:51,819 --> 00:49:57,680
leaving so it was be protected them to

825
00:49:56,599 --> 00:49:59,990
have a lot of the government by the

826
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:06,589
government over doctrine because they

827
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:08,328
would read a model of and model so

828
00:50:06,589 --> 00:50:11,779
responding would be simpler if your

829
00:50:08,329 --> 00:50:14,440
store the ontology it would be working

830
00:50:11,779 --> 00:50:17,000
fine it may even change the logic when

831
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:22,099
designing the next generation that is

832
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:25,779
the mismatch of genomes can bring up and

833
00:50:22,099 --> 00:50:28,579
that into five minutes it's a proposal

834
00:50:25,779 --> 00:50:32,349
second which is much more important we

835
00:50:28,579 --> 00:50:35,779
need to change system of relations and

836
00:50:32,349 --> 00:50:38,779
security and culture and the process is

837
00:50:35,779 --> 00:50:41,839
not between be required never darken the

838
00:50:38,779 --> 00:50:45,140
role of the government is very big which

839
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:49,250
was not resources worth for everything

840
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:54,390
and yet the cannot be real knowledge in

841
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:57,210
recovery it's a marathon is media a

842
00:50:54,390 --> 00:51:00,330
Muslim population similarly Tom Sawyer

843
00:50:57,210 --> 00:51:01,320
book not only is preservation of concept

844
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:03,270
there's of paint

845
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:06,150
don't display moment immediately show

846
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:09,110
and at the end they are so many of the

847
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:13,800
sort of the form of Eagle eager people

848
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:16,050
do it you need to give something so what

849
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:18,750
you wanted if a miser - you need to help

850
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:26,730
them even de morcerf's a la première

851
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:28,380
wood which quickly sold organizations to

852
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:30,540
gather as many interested people about

853
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:32,160
security in one place then it means that

854
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:33,990
the task is to be resolved it could be

855
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:36,779
resolved and if somebody wants to

856
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:40,500
understand circumstances some other

857
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:43,080
operations organization when you arrange

858
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:45,540
this help you don't just by the

859
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:48,180
government but externally I would also

860
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:51,630
focus on that Lola she do sneeringly

861
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:55,859
we need to have seriously rng rng of

862
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:58,470
equal intelligence encoding it was not

863
00:51:55,860 --> 00:52:01,620
far welcome computers are not far but

864
00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:07,290
it's a different types of security Hardy

865
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:09,870
should bring their hands on this period

866
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:13,770
he made enemy quarantine must have

867
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:16,259
enough funds for security in a different

868
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:22,100
story on one hand the market is

869
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:22,100
oversaturated and it's all irrational

870
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:29,129
can I give you are not going to keep it

871
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:32,820
whole and incomplete doubles

872
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:35,070
said Holmes doors just in case it all

873
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:36,530
must be operated to maintain tour I

874
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:40,530
don't know putting your party

875
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:44,130
mysteriously they have two cars one for

876
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:46,110
twenty papac's and cabbage that we spend

877
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:49,320
money for restricting money from are

878
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:51,870
indeed regulation must be quite flexible

879
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:53,430
or Tramiel to the bastion Turin team

880
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:56,250
just be shuttle acknowledged

881
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:57,569
Lytle colleagues did not mention look

882
00:52:56,250 --> 00:53:00,839
look wait wait wait I have something

883
00:52:57,569 --> 00:53:11,430
else to say you so I was writing down

884
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:14,759
something no Ishikawa / teachers and

885
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:18,990
there must be a structure for security

886
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:22,099
from general designer Natori must study

887
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:24,379
break period cool it's not which it has

888
00:53:22,099 --> 00:53:26,869
comprehensive design including

889
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:30,750
regulation restoration technology

890
00:53:26,869 --> 00:53:32,790
general directions ontology of our idea

891
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:37,440
no matter if the person will design them

892
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:39,839
the way that similar design yet offering

893
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,480
is Monisha in there mr. Bartok ever own

894
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:44,460
stop achievement America honest ran the

895
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:47,329
MonaVie speech reject you and you so

896
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:50,599
that Napoleon is a past Macedo everybody

897
00:53:47,329 --> 00:53:53,940
should reach a funnel so that

898
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:58,799
neighboring areas would be bigger to

899
00:53:53,940 --> 00:54:04,170
German objective environment to the same

900
00:53:58,799 --> 00:54:06,420
person can I can I ask not to bring the

901
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:15,109
light to my face it's not possible to

902
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:18,270
see can you remove the flashlight let's

903
00:54:15,109 --> 00:54:20,369
do that we keep on talking government

904
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:27,150
government what each one is I never saw

905
00:54:20,369 --> 00:54:32,430
dust no there's nothing to rely on be

906
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:34,920
relied on government is to bring more

907
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:38,009
freedom to business look for what is

908
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:43,760
going on in construction cut twisters

909
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:43,760
voices also developing like a bubble

910
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:51,060
why look at the regulation is there any

911
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:57,030
government plan on construction maybe

912
00:54:51,060 --> 00:55:00,480
the government is saying new houses or

913
00:54:57,030 --> 00:55:02,280
no different houses no no it is not

914
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,590
result by the government

915
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:09,660
the producers construction companies

916
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:15,920
built houses better and better the

917
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:18,509
better houses now than the one I live at

918
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:20,580
no matter what they say people say

919
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:22,650
before it was better no let me assure

920
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:28,200
you before no worse not better

921
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:30,750
so the industry is developing and our

922
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:34,830
industry is developing with microscope

923
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:37,050
big speed because we still hope that

924
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:39,170
government will do something for us

925
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:44,780
especially in IT security come on

926
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:47,900
nothing to hope for let us try to do

927
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:52,220
Cheryl with IT security actually I tried

928
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:56,910
this idea but unfortunately regulator

929
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:58,230
punched me very quickly they say nope we

930
00:55:56,910 --> 00:56:02,370
will do that I think this is wrong

931
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:04,710
approach but we need to get together do

932
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:10,640
something here and then we will have C 0

933
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:12,780
may be not C 0 then B 0 C 0 and

934
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:16,770
everybody would buy and then there will

935
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:18,710
be development maybe so protect it I'm

936
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:22,230
sure it will not be as potential bugs

937
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:24,420
house wise would rather have something

938
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:27,090
than nothing so don't rely on the

939
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:31,680
government the government sugar must

940
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:34,770
regulate Gigi's economy listen that we

941
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:36,919
can't we all see that then we need to go

942
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:41,070
another way

943
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:43,280
you know the pony anomaly she wouldn't

944
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:46,100
yet my point to you you

945
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:48,530
a queen of serious people on the market

946
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:50,600
since that Union they announced a

947
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:52,850
request to pitch deep water must be if

948
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:55,990
you collect the space about data

949
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:58,310
security collecting all resources

950
00:56:55,990 --> 00:57:01,129
including those people who are here and

951
00:56:58,310 --> 00:57:03,950
is able to organize this in the right

952
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:05,450
way but the chef means the question

953
00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:07,910
would you know this would be a winner

954
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:10,129
because you know this world so like this

955
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:13,700
that you cannot do anything alone it

956
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:18,020
must be so sure must be community and it

957
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:21,589
must be aiming pursuing results let me

958
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:23,930
repeat even washing the page they travel

959
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:27,530
you see that this situation is getting

960
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:30,680
assure maybe already became mature so

961
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:33,550
please everybody think about it maybe we

962
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:36,620
should start normal decent dialogues but

963
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:46,160
this you know some people will get

964
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:50,690
around someone strong first page D we

965
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:56,480
have 450 people now have 9,000 people we

966
00:57:50,690 --> 00:58:01,340
started from gigs director started to

967
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:12,980
thumb then security officers so this is

968
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:18,200
developing we started our selves so

969
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:22,310
strange what we need to look for the

970
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:24,230
hash nodes within our network but what

971
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:26,570
you are talking about to have a security

972
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:29,470
system but now it's norm now we see how

973
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:34,390
the world is changing industry is moving

974
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:37,819
and it's good her becoming realists and

975
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:39,410
there's I think the current discussion

976
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:44,360
is very interesting to me

977
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:46,730
so why with the fact that the idea we

978
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:48,760
have is to gather the participants of

979
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:52,240
different industries and

980
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:55,380
have different people management and the

981
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:57,910
technical teams that will be

982
00:58:55,380 --> 00:59:00,460
understanding or identifying themselves

983
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:05,170
differently or people that are hiking

984
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:07,810
industrial systems here is the idea of

985
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:09,880
our conference and if will you mix us up

986
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:13,540
in such a way here we're very glad that

987
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:23,560
this topic is developing so if you have

988
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:26,759
any questions feel free to ask them ok

989
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:30,340
great ok

990
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:33,580
spasibo first of all thank you very much

991
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:37,570
to moderators for an interesting

992
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:43,509
discussion we had what was done as part

993
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:48,510
of 2 to 3 woods and I heard that we need

994
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:52,440
some clarification so in math you have

995
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:55,090
two two topics lien function Monday

996
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:56,290
derivative from the sanctions when we

997
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:59,710
are talking about about the

998
00:59:56,290 --> 01:00:04,500
informational security the first is the

999
00:59:59,710 --> 01:00:08,980
derivative and to make the right

1000
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:13,720
decisions about providing security he

1001
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:16,110
needs to understand how the function

1002
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:22,660
that is called information is changing

1003
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:26,320
the person with perception skills is

1004
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:32,170
limited in how personal information if

1005
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:37,240
an average probably comprehending like

1006
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:38,170
ten thousand characters wonder things

1007
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,848
like Napoleon

1008
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:51,500
good

1009
01:00:39,849 --> 01:00:55,280
understand lab mm information is created

1010
01:00:51,500 --> 01:01:01,609
not just by itself it's created first

1011
01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:05,000
for the human to assess it and to get

1012
01:01:01,609 --> 01:01:07,160
get something from it through the

1013
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:10,329
statistics of what is going on with

1014
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:12,890
information than the velocity of

1015
01:01:10,329 --> 01:01:15,950
information of creation of information

1016
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:19,430
in the human kind his million times

1017
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:23,868
higher then the comprehension rates

1018
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:25,609
IDC says that in 2011 the humankind is

1019
01:01:23,869 --> 01:01:29,210
creating like 10 terabytes of

1020
01:01:25,609 --> 01:01:31,880
information per second and I said that

1021
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:36,980
the comprehension rate is million times

1022
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:40,280
lower so this means as the according to

1023
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:44,450
Moore's law information grows like nine

1024
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:49,039
times we are coming to an age where we

1025
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:51,078
will not only be creating information

1026
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:53,470
there will be less information which the

1027
01:01:51,079 --> 01:01:57,020
date the amount of data we will see

1028
01:01:53,470 --> 01:02:07,118
gathering will be huge and the question

1029
01:01:57,020 --> 01:02:09,920
will be how do we use it the person

1030
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:12,559
where a well-known saying who owns

1031
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:15,200
information on the world will change in

1032
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:20,650
the government or the country that will

1033
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:24,680
be able to provide for national security

1034
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:27,730
will be the winner that's why we talk

1035
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:30,000
about different methods or heck change

1036
01:02:27,730 --> 01:02:33,990
No

1037
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:36,270
in my opinion we are at a stage where

1038
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:38,660
everything we've been doing should be

1039
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:41,460
starting from a cyber culture

1040
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:47,549
informational security should not only

1041
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:50,940
be relatively specialist but everyone

1042
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:58,250
knows stations used to be caring about

1043
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:58,250
it the cyber culture needs to be running

1044
01:02:59,570 --> 01:03:16,230
and the earth and will be gathering the

1045
01:03:12,109 --> 01:03:18,529
used a days where will the data list

1046
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:22,609
stores all those questions are important

1047
01:03:18,530 --> 01:03:27,090
that is why if we think about the future

1048
01:03:22,609 --> 01:03:31,529
and the future to some the country that

1049
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:37,170
will understand its main goal is super

1050
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:41,250
wide cyber culture you cannot have a

1051
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:44,849
world you just don't follow the basic

1052
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:47,369
hygiene principles the same applies to

1053
01:03:44,849 --> 01:03:52,080
the information security first thank you

1054
01:03:47,369 --> 01:03:58,200
Joe the second extra not as I said we

1055
01:03:52,080 --> 01:04:02,520
will be gathering millions of humankind

1056
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:05,930
capability to comprehend it the data

1057
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:09,560
will be stored in different resources

1058
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:13,410
enjoy this task done for the humankind

1059
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:20,540
will be teacher asleep apologize

1060
01:04:13,410 --> 01:04:20,540
immunity protects those small certainly

1061
01:04:40,760 --> 01:05:12,510
we hear different sources sorry like to

1062
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:18,390
questions your recipe is cyber cyber

1063
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:22,050
culture and trusted services first yes I

1064
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:26,279
precaution needs to hide you need to

1065
01:05:22,050 --> 01:05:29,970
understand that you need to have that

1066
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:31,830
cyber culture first second you need to

1067
01:05:29,970 --> 01:05:36,750
understand that the information itself

1068
01:05:31,830 --> 01:05:41,100
is changing and the data is used in the

1069
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:44,910
business economy digital transformation

1070
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:47,190
and as these this is happening we need

1071
01:05:44,910 --> 01:05:53,720
to be thinking about trust the services

1072
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:53,720
that needs to be demanded service models

1073
01:05:54,380 --> 01:06:02,820
need to be the future lies in how we

1074
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:05,700
apply you define whether the information

1075
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:07,440
you're getting is true of thank you

1076
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:15,960
thank you very much

1077
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:18,690
can I have my hair please today I would

1078
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:25,240
like the same the question regarding the

1079
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:28,800
presentation yes first of all wait

1080
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:33,129
Russian government is doing a lot

1081
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:37,690
provide for Eurasian security tier wise

1082
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:42,760
Lord that helps us the modern in terms

1083
01:06:37,690 --> 01:06:47,230
of information security seven that

1084
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:50,170
provides for civic responsibility the

1085
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:56,770
sheetal for incidents and for now just

1086
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:59,710
the paper protection of the really do

1087
01:06:56,770 --> 01:07:05,350
you have some progress yeah some cases

1088
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:09,580
we like the experience we are flying the

1089
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:16,509
American approach America's rhenium

1090
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:18,790
assets we have 90 security forces but I

1091
01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:20,710
think we need it only when we understand

1092
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:25,259
the threat and we understand the risks

1093
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:25,260
there is something son's material that

1094
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:32,140
ordinary people can get to provide that

1095
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:35,110
really positive crack this unknown are

1096
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:38,410
in Tehran in that sense positive Hank

1097
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:41,860
days as event is targeting to

1098
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:49,480
professionals the message we send what

1099
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:51,520
needs to be targeted could you I don't

1100
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:55,060
know how it can be done maybe mass media

1101
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:58,300
can help but maybe we can change the

1102
01:07:55,060 --> 01:08:03,160
message we need to convey the risks and

1103
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:04,900
the threats that they face most people

1104
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:06,609
they have a smartphone they post the

1105
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:09,690
information openly and all that

1106
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:14,110
information becomes accessible for

1107
01:08:09,690 --> 01:08:16,210
attackers for foreign in foreign

1108
01:08:14,110 --> 01:08:19,480
intelligence services so we're at a

1109
01:08:16,210 --> 01:08:22,859
standoff half of a military standoff so

1110
01:08:19,479 --> 01:08:27,569
there needs to be something done to

1111
01:08:22,859 --> 01:08:27,569
explain the informational security to

1112
01:08:27,738 --> 01:08:35,160
and there we will have money we will

1113
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:37,830
have the demand and the solutions the

1114
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:39,839
team at Ikeda a pedra need not reach a

1115
01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:44,250
businessman and besides the business

1116
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:46,309
development and targeting the business

1117
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:51,149
to business market it will not be

1118
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:53,520
available if the small medium business

1119
01:08:51,149 --> 01:09:00,238
does not understand the need and now

1120
01:08:53,520 --> 01:09:02,730
it's more pressurized top-down approach

1121
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:05,608
when everyone is just covering their

1122
01:09:02,729 --> 01:09:15,049
backs with the papers instead of doing

1123
01:09:05,609 --> 01:09:18,270
the stuff next my opinion correctly that

1124
01:09:15,049 --> 01:09:20,670
market is small 146 million people is

1125
01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:27,029
very small indeed we see that our

1126
01:09:20,670 --> 01:09:29,069
country is try to of the markets of

1127
01:09:27,029 --> 01:09:30,930
Europe we should be an organic pet

1128
01:09:29,069 --> 01:09:33,569
market but question tenders how many

1129
01:09:30,930 --> 01:09:36,390
pieces of software produced in Russia in

1130
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:40,920
the area of faces my TV didn't translate

1131
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:43,430
it into Chinese language huge markets

1132
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:46,950
markets which are ready to work with us

1133
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:48,839
producers of weapons and arms in Russia

1134
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:51,200
to supply their products to these

1135
01:09:48,839 --> 01:09:55,440
markets the same with French language

1136
01:09:51,200 --> 01:10:01,099
African countries as well which recently

1137
01:09:55,440 --> 01:10:01,099
was played down for half a month in the

1138
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:07,739
network because of the hacker attacks

1139
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:08,910
question 2 HD come on your leaders

1140
01:10:07,739 --> 01:10:10,440
whether you're going to enter

1141
01:10:08,910 --> 01:10:14,010
international markets the answer is

1142
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:17,009
quite simple we work in national markets

1143
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:19,050
since 2011 and for us so is a certain

1144
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:21,090
weighted function the tariff so

1145
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:23,489
potential causes and potential

1146
01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:26,700
revelation chance the market is one of

1147
01:10:23,489 --> 01:10:29,280
the most disingenuous market you need to

1148
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:31,910
make a joint venture Chinese mother

1149
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:36,240
you know whirring a lot of efforts to

1150
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:38,400
develop them directly actually speaking

1151
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:40,650
we're earning here in rubles and

1152
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:45,089
spending they're not in rubles and

1153
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:47,480
Chinese market to me is probably not in

1154
01:10:45,090 --> 01:10:50,910
the first players because it's much more

1155
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:53,969
complex rather than American market

1156
01:10:50,910 --> 01:10:56,610
American market is easier to enter than

1157
01:10:53,970 --> 01:11:03,180
Chinese and this larger journey Chinese

1158
01:10:56,610 --> 01:11:05,450
flag we finish this I see there are

1159
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:09,150
certain ideas the village here in Russia

1160
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:10,849
okay what Mustang go abroad and they

1161
01:11:09,150 --> 01:11:13,379
were thinking we need to go to

1162
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:15,120
Australian market or Italian markets I

1163
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:18,390
need to do everything cost the same

1164
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:21,780
amount I didn't elated that Italian but

1165
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:23,820
that's in Venezuela if I don't put one

1166
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:27,620
thing but Italy's Richard if you take

1167
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:30,540
the world map we always look for these

1168
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:33,390
priorities I think it's a certain

1169
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:36,660
strategy of forest development and now

1170
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:39,570
he isn't a positive even Mobius has a

1171
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:42,900
business in Europe South Area middle

1172
01:11:39,570 --> 01:11:44,940
east last year we opened an office area

1173
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:47,400
in Brazil quite domestic markets we have

1174
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:51,870
another second mr. us but it's different

1175
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:54,269
story so actually it's just looks like

1176
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:58,860
Chinese Chinese wheat market it's not so

1177
01:11:54,270 --> 01:12:02,640
easy there is a person too eager

1178
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:03,210
if we had huge investments even a

1179
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:07,260
vegetable

1180
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:09,660
Ginga if we were unlimited and money now

1181
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:12,990
you behave differently is rabbit we're

1182
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:15,720
earning rubles here and spending not

1183
01:12:12,990 --> 01:12:18,450
rubles there which is so clear but you

1184
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:22,710
understand nothing ventured nothing

1185
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:25,960
gained the markets are split my advice

1186
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:30,120
languages and entering Venezuelan market

1187
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:34,900
automatically means related to Latin

1188
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:38,950
American or Hispanic speaking money for

1189
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:42,480
two goals with language countries so

1190
01:12:38,950 --> 01:12:45,790
easy understand that understand that I

1191
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:48,549
just try to say that lesson vendors do

1192
01:12:45,790 --> 01:12:50,650
that for you to understand our products

1193
01:12:48,550 --> 01:12:54,160
is inserted into English Italian South

1194
01:12:50,650 --> 01:12:58,420
Korean and wherever we work we work the

1195
01:12:54,160 --> 01:13:02,559
language could be in Brazil in Latin

1196
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:07,540
America music it produced in English was

1197
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:09,400
fun so the problem arises walking for

1198
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:12,280
they own the beach enterprise we don't

1199

yes what range in service to the past

1282
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:22,469
three cheaper

1283
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:24,870
my opinion nearly 300 types of the

1284
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:27,840
entrances first type those who are so

1285
01:17:24,870 --> 01:17:30,090
really the businesses in the deterrent

1286

issue there is format say it in January

1289

1290
01:17:39,270 --> 01:17:43,830
only home but just as the management

1291
01:17:41,370 --> 01:17:47,670
understand remedy who are participate

1292
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:50,330
after over them good type disappointed

1293
01:17:47,670 --> 01:17:55,700
one at the second type system

1294
01:17:50,330 --> 01:17:58,200
