1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:06,120
for a good evening maybe for some I

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:09,480
propose to start because we have an

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,219
agenda we need to go through I hope it

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:16,890
would be even interesting for somebody

5
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:18,930
and clearly everybody wants to get out

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,960
of here have something to eat or to

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,220
drink and our beside but the things that

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,410
we are going to talk about here would be

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:40,170
interesting for everybody not just

10
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:48,350
banking sector people so the idea of our

11
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:53,510
title is we have some old problems

12
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:58,530
called pains difficulties in IT

13
00:00:53,510 --> 00:01:03,769
cybersecurity for financial technologies

14
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:08,250
but now it looks different sizer new

15
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:11,070
means for new essences so the name of

16
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:14,850
our session is landscape of financial

17
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:18,240
suburb cyber threats an old dog learned

18
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:21,229
new tricks you're going to have a person

19
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:28,710
from insert Alexander Kuznetsov

20
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:31,400
Alexander Kalina from Group IB say

21
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,399
Mourinho's of

22
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:46,069
so giggle one of Kaspersky Lab looks in

23
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:49,929
Novikov and Alexander Popkin is the only

24
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:49,929
representative of financial organization

25
00:01:52,450 --> 00:02:00,640
for a counterweight to represent vendors

26
00:01:55,429 --> 00:02:05,599
integrators and we have another person

27
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,610
who's in the room now from fin cert if

28
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:11,629
we won't be able to answer the questions

29
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:14,870
I will show you this person later mister

30
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:20,238
person let's start from the simple

31
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:31,430
things have a certain past where we

32
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:35,329
lived for some time and we were fighting

33
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:39,139
against it but it got transformed in

34
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:42,980
2018 we had a lot of documents legal

35
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:48,260
documents norms guidelines aimed to

36
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:55,190
minimize security risks implementation

37
00:02:48,260 --> 00:03:01,340
of these things require certain tools in

38
00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:05,900
one of such tools was fin sac in the

39
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:13,750
Bank of Russia which took the first

40
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:16,519
strike from the community banking and

41
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:20,349
volunteers who wanted to cooperate with

42
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:24,010
us in terms of providing IT security and

43
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:28,730
opposing cyber risks or cyberattacks and

44
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:32,540
what happened next

45
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:34,819
he's been working for a year you see a

46
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:39,910
good trend to increase the number of

47
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:42,500
participants and we also have good

48
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:47,420
indicators in terms of quality of

49
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:51,080
information provided by you what needs

50
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:53,690
to be set the better the quality of

51
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:58,299
information the better the easier for us

52
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:58,299
to understand what happens and the

53
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:07,420
financial sector and the faster we can

54
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:09,980
respond to help you solve your problems

55
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:17,269
however there are a number of questions

56
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:20,570
relate to informing us in some areas we

57
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:24,979
have certain misunderstanding among the

58
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:27,099
community members not just

59
00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:30,820
misunderstanding but we have a number of

60
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:34,630
difficulties related to the vendors of

61
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:38,200
ATMs and other equipment and hardware

62
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:42,229
I'm talking about big advantages that

63
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:44,450
appeared not just we but the government

64
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:48,349
and the regulator's see that the level

65
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:51,289
of protection in the financial area has

66
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:54,440
grown is growing well the trends we

67
00:04:51,289 --> 00:05:01,010
observe not just Pleasant but it bring

68
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:05,719
us joy and happiness and we wouldn't

69
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:09,110
like to lose this trend and we very hope

70
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:12,580
that it's going to be maintained and all

71
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:16,729
the difficulties in the three main

72
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:19,310
barriers where we see some problems some

73
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:25,340
issues we are going to talk through them

74
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:32,500
and one of them is new tools and means

75
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:32,500
that we have in cyberspace

76
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:41,150
in attack attempts why attempts

77
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:43,580
according to our statistics maybe people

78
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:46,460
correct me if I am wrong were less

79
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:51,349
successful attacks but more attempts

80
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:52,870
though so I would like to ask the first

81
00:05:51,350 --> 00:06:01,060
question

82
00:05:52,870 --> 00:06:01,060
guess whom I will ask it to Finn's hurt

83
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:14,500
we wrote the report together at first

84
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:28,549
make sure that the main summary items in

85
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:35,320
terms of the trends what trends we saw

86
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:35,320
last year moving to this year Pavel I

87
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:43,010
finally understood how to switch on the

88
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,480
mic as the moderator has already

89
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:50,599
mentioned the number of successful

90
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:59,750
attacks at least within insert zone of

91
00:06:50,600 --> 00:07:03,350
responsibility and colleagues so the

92
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:07,430
number of successful attacks

93
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:10,600
decline in Russia for sure I'm not sure

94
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:15,460
about outside of Russia

95
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:18,670
so the growing level of protection

96
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:23,169
forces hackers to improve their

97
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:27,070
qualification improve themselves

98
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:30,020
therefore the attacks that become

99
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:33,980
successful become better in terms of

100
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:37,340
analysis what I wanted to say maybe

101
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:45,020
colleagues would comment on that last

102
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:50,450
year we reflected or detected two

103
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:55,190
attacks which were hard to attribute in

104
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:57,700
terms of well known by the expert

105
00:07:55,190 --> 00:08:02,290
community groups of hackers

106
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:07,930
everybody knows Cobalt everybody knows

107
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:11,960
group silence what we observed last year

108
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:17,390
it was different in terms of tools it's

109
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:20,510
like the signature of the hackers cobalt

110
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:25,490
and science were using one toolbox and

111
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:30,530
these guys started to use other tools

112
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:33,200
for example in classics to initiate the

113
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:38,299
processes and the compromise networks

114
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:41,360
they used the version of utilities pass

115
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:45,079
exact win exactly now there was the open

116
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:48,170
source instrument written initially by

117
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,180
Python which was doing the same but

118
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:52,120
before these two attacks we never came

119
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:58,209
across that

120
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:58,209
we believe that this group is a new one

121
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:09,350
at least according to us our version

122
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:15,910
this could be a piece of a piece of

123
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:15,910
cobalt hit by a bear last year or a new

124
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:22,699
group and we think we can expect new

125
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:26,839
attacks and attacks are quite blunt

126
00:09:22,699 --> 00:09:38,990
because one of them was masked under the

127
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:43,420
fin search email so it's early to relax

128
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:46,279
I was talking into other section

129
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:52,219
the damage was hundreds of millions

130
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:55,990
before and year before lost the total

131
00:09:52,220 --> 00:10:02,470
damage of hackers attacks to the banks

132
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:02,470
was about 70 to 80 million good trend

133
00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:12,500
but as the we have new actors there on

134
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:14,810
the scene we must not breathe out and

135
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:18,310
relax because otherwise the damage would

136
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:26,768
be encountering hundreds of millions

137
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:26,768
thank you I would like to hear something

138
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:36,099
related to the attackers and malware

139
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:39,470
abroad maybe there is a difference

140
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:42,939
we have understanding maybe suspicion

141
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:42,939
maybe hypothesis that

142
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:51,970
knew the hackers are not lucky in Russia

143
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:56,729
they may go abroad I would like to ask

144
00:10:51,970 --> 00:11:02,230
Alexander you do monitor foreign

145
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:06,100
organizations yes do you have any data

146
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:09,670
or thoughts or forecasts or results

147
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:13,240
which we could compare are we managing

148
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:15,550
to do anything here or not I cannot give

149
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:22,420
you about statistics we can collect and

150
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:27,910
correlate that the assumption that many

151
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:32,650
attackers and hackers get Russia as

152
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:40,020
their training ground then go abroad to

153
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:45,329
hit big time we do we have many attempts

154
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:45,329
but very small success rates

155
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:56,350
and criminal groups could be quite

156
00:11:53,020 --> 00:12:05,860
successful but if you have a center that

157
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:08,110
processes a lot of companies so if you

158
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:12,190
have a center that processes a lot of

159
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:16,870
companies in terms of security you see

160
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:19,560
that criminal groups are not working

161
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:29,290
with just one company they have a

162
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:33,130
spreaded attack into many ones so that's

163
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:36,459
very noticeable it's easy to detect

164
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:39,550
during last year as you've correctly

165
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:47,470
mentioned we saw the general decline of

166
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:50,859
all kinds of attacks but more phishing

167
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:53,050
not just in Russia but abroad there's

168
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:55,990
the anti-phishing work group they

169
00:12:53,050 --> 00:13:00,040
published a report and there's a growing

170
00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:07,020
phishing rate phishing the stupid easy

171
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:10,560
to make entry barrier is very small it's

172
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,560
easy to do

173
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:27,849
but let's see why let me sum it up to

174
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:32,710
understand your idea our suspicions are

175
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:40,060
not groundless okay what do you think

176
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:44,170
about it alexei I would like to

177
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:48,699
understand we have financial

178
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:55,300
organizations located in Russia and they

179
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:58,090
have branches in other countries and you

180
00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:01,660
think when they are attacked are they

181
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:05,730
attacked by those of Russia or not we

182
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:10,209
are talking about geographical location

183
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:14,800
use the are in other countries give

184
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:19,120
organization attacks to the head the

185
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:24,099
head is in Russia something if the

186
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:32,280
bridge is abroad the attacks is aiming

187
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:35,710
the branch right whatever is within the

188
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:40,569
responsibility zone under our

189
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:43,030
supervision what was the question here

190
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:50,440
we have set up a certain balance between

191
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:54,220
the security and technology and if the

192
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:56,590
hackers here are not succeeding they go

193
00:14:54,220 --> 00:15:00,490
abroad you the branches there and

194
00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:04,020
there's attack on to there the attack is

195
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:05,460
abroad right correct physically yes

196
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:08,560
understand

197
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:10,990
and then I agree with the college from

198
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:17,319
IB group that

199
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:36,490
the distributing a lot of phishing

200
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:42,880
emails and it is much more difficult to

201
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:47,410
deliver information and we should

202
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:54,670
remember the attacks when they from

203
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:57,910
infrastructure of other banks which are

204
00:15:54,670 --> 00:16:02,189
more complex and the community didn't

205
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:02,189
get used to them that's another trend I

206
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:15,570
[Music]

207
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:15,569
join colleagues who became better safe

208
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:25,839
you have some emails but very few

209
00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:29,500
successful ones what Alex see referred

210
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:31,750
to CIS countries one one local burn

211
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:34,930
became the victim of hackers and then

212
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:42,850
this bank started to infect other CIS

213
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:44,310
banks this Bank is not the

214
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:47,920
responsibility of Russian banks right

215
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:50,170
you know Russian Federation says beyond

216
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:58,599
we are clean now it's your turn now we

217
00:16:50,170 --> 00:17:00,479
didn't come clean with tried then it

218
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,399
goes abroad

219
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:06,339
the wheel will turn what it was worst

220
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:10,449
and better I think in a couple of years

221
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:12,688
it will go back to its basics but then

222
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:17,650
there would be other technologies other

223
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:22,360
methods of protection and attack as well

224
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:27,220
but now so far everything is fine we

225
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:32,408
need to speed 3 times and touch wood for

226
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:36,549
God's sake let's talk about the tools

227
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:40,710
and groups and communities that try to

228
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:45,250
bring us this harm now we have cobalt

229
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:51,760
which we thought could be tired it is

230
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:55,030
not they continued what else we had our

231
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,700
silence whatever all of them are moving

232
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:59,678
around somewhere

233
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:03,700
but what's then what's next what might

234
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:07,120
happen will they work further expanding

235
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:09,720
or splitting using new tools or maybe

236
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,719
there would be

237
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:18,428
simply and exploiters the some of the

238
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:23,919
software used for attacks is bought in

239
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:27,640
darknet then they realize it I wanted to

240
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:31,260
ask from alexei what do you think about

241
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:37,450
it where we go what shall we hope for

242
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:40,900
what shall we hope for yes I don't know

243
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:48,400
it would be a lot of work any time I'm

244
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:52,929
sure oh yes in fact we constantly see

245
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:57,970
new upgrades new technical approaches

246
00:18:52,929 --> 00:19:01,179
new tactics new tools that hackers use

247
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:05,260
what I see dangerous is the speed with

248
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:08,620
which hackers adopt somebody else's

249
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:13,540
toolbox to themselves the speed that

250
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:20,049
they get exploits and use them in mail

251
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:22,330
outs that is really striking because in

252
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:25,480
the community and among the security

253
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:28,000
people not everybody managed to patch

254
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,280
they don't even managed to learn about

255
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:35,049
the vulnerability although the first

256
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:39,790
mentioning about it was like long ago 1

257
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:44,679
or 2 months so this is a dangerous trend

258
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:50,559
if they are so fast the will were will

259
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:56,040
surely turn and when developing

260
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:59,410
different financial technologies

261
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:01,600
including central bank will take a

262
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:04,750
closer look there in terms of IT

263
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,300
security because maybe they will have

264
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:11,680
some new vectors that we are unaware of

265
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:15,129
at the moment let me tell you let me

266
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:18,300
throw a bone into the audience to say

267
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:23,530
what the hope for we are talking about

268
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:26,409
small groups of people one percentage

269
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:30,010
0.1% of people who do something and

270
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:31,720
create invent modifying in ninety

271
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:34,510
percent ninety nine percent of people

272
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:40,900
who are using that the boy in the dark

273
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:43,390
market as mr. Califano said and now we

274
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:47,350
have a bit of silence that will will

275
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:50,860
turn is going to be another hype and we

276
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:53,290
will have to extinguish a fire and a

277
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:56,290
bicycle when you write but instead we

278
00:20:53,290 --> 00:21:01,899
need to use this break now strengthen

279
00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:03,820
the defense now and prepare to the

280
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:06,460
number of attacks will grow and number

281
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:11,439
of people that zero 1.1 percent is like

282
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:13,420
a virus will mutate grow become mature

283
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,040
and instead of ten would be ten thousand

284
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:19,360
and it would be much more difficult to

285
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:23,820
cope with these forces these are not the

286
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,820
sellers we don't sell fear

287
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:34,280
it's a logic it's feasible logic we see

288
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:38,489
is going to be like that and the bank's

289
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:43,620
due to regulators will feel better off

290
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:50,940
than retailers and sectors with less

291
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:55,969
regulator's but these are money millions

292
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:58,470
billions of dollars last year said okay

293
00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:01,620
let's break something but that's so much

294
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:05,900
money Swift hundreds of millions of

295
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:08,820
dollars I'm talking with my friends from

296
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,890
private banking from Investment Banking

297
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:15,539
they say guys

298
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:18,679
you're hackers while breaking this bank

299
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:23,280
if there's a bloomberg you they have

300
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:32,820
money so I'm same there but several

301
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:37,139
zeros on top if our bankers American

302
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:40,490
bankers don't wait until they start

303
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:44,669
running around with the burning eyes

304
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:48,480
last year in tech laid out the first

305
00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:51,990
transaction on anti fraud that is the

306
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:56,010
first step which will allow us to become

307
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:58,140
more mature in five years time so that

308
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:00,629
probably would be the development and

309
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:05,760
then the will will turn I like your

310
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:08,280
metaphor and then we'll see even if I

311
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:14,220
understand you directly strengthening

312
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:20,070
the defense we have well known legacy

313
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:23,890
experience toolboxes from that we should

314
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:27,309
establish some sort of possible

315
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:29,740
a set of algorithms and solutions that

316
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:31,660
work on the early stage now the problem

317
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:35,740
is that all the bank's know their

318
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:38,500
problems there's the end of PhD banks

319
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:41,380
come to me and say guys we looked at as

320
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:44,679
you break in hack Bank events and

321
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:50,200
various terminals is great you know if

322
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:53,320
we throw there I say let us quickly know

323
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:56,200
they say no don't we know is going to be

324
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:58,990
bad let us come to you in five years

325
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:02,169
time we'll do something and we'll pass a

326
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:06,059
test banks know where it's bad they

327
00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:11,799
simply sit and hope nobody else knows

328
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:13,780
interesting version let me ask you some

329
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:17,100
question - a big question you feel

330
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:17,100
yourself so calm

331
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:25,240
what colleagues talk about the number of

332
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:30,250
number of attacks increasing successful

333
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:33,460
less my point to you this situation is a

334
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:35,070
false calm I'm not going to talk on

335
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:37,960
behalf of the whole banking community

336
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:42,480
but I will tell you on behalf of large

337
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:45,880
banks whatever we see now decrease of

338
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:49,030
successful attacks means that the banks

339
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:53,020
from the classical physical service go

340
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:57,970
to remote service you don't have to give

341
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:58,510
an example of look maybe everybody loved

342
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:01,419
it

343
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:06,790
beloved tinkoff we don't have the

344
00:25:01,419 --> 00:25:09,760
branches many banks move to decrease of

345
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:11,830
branches and increase remote services

346
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:15,940
through each glance can get their

347
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:20,710
financial products applications for

348
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:23,950
loans transfers investment products and

349
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:25,960
a lot of other things there are four

350
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:28,000
banks try to develop this product line

351
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,340
and of course they do that with the help

352
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,380
of remote channels could be mobile

353
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,560
devices internet bank working through

354
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:37,970
tablets

355
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:40,010
there are four one way or another people

356
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:43,120
are moved to digitalization it all goes

357
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:48,260
to digital world of course it cannot

358
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:50,929
lead behind increase of protection the

359
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:53,360
more software as a more fetches any

360
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:57,250
system is vulnerable I don't have to

361
00:25:53,360 --> 00:26:01,580
explain that and when this unprepared

362
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:04,640
people would be attacked I think it's a

363
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:07,629
matter of time when it comes to that

364
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,850
that the grandmother will not be able to

365
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:16,040
get their pension without walking to the

366
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:17,810
mobile office de clichy can make mobile

367
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:23,379
more attacks would be against his

368
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:27,940
grandmother she could be cold asked to

369
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:33,350
find her CV and card number

370
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:35,750
ask her to or force her or convince her

371
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:39,169
to make money transfer as the bank

372
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:42,560
started to use social media using smart

373
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:44,210
Shadbolt Chad bought techniques machine

374
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,580
learning techniques sooner or later

375
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:48,620
everything would be subject of attacks

376
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:52,760
in the nearest future I'm sure we'll see

377
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:57,560
a explosion a breakthrough of new

378
00:26:52,760 --> 00:27:02,980
attacks on to new banking tools we see

379
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:06,080
that number of attempts to attack

380
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:09,050
clients money is nothing but growing and

381
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:12,080
digitalization of our society will lead

382
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:13,730
to that and this is a fact if we see how

383
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,500
it happens in Europe at least in

384
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:21,350
Amsterdam or in Vienna

385
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:25,670
pay attention some branches when you

386
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:29,090
come you speak to a robot in the menu of

387
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:32,990
info point you choose a product so the

388
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:35,330
number of human hands goes down it is

389
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:39,050
reached through decrease of

390
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:41,449
automatisation and implementation of new

391
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:43,010
IT technologies which are subject of

392
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:44,510
vulnerabilities and tax it would be

393
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:46,320
worse in terms of added security would

394
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:51,570
be nothing but worse

395
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:53,490
I started shivering we were not fighting

396
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:55,230
anybody and we thought that appearing

397
00:27:53,490 --> 00:28:02,460
our new financial tools is not so bad

398
00:27:55,230 --> 00:28:05,310
not so scary its navigable as soon as we

399
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:08,130
go to mobile phones before people were

400
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:10,440
walking and somewhere reading books and

401
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:14,420
talking now pay attention what people do

402
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:22,560
they read mobile phones they go with

403
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:27,510
headsets and like a joke if somebody is

404
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:32,040
listening to you and person is taking

405
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:35,100
one headphone from one ear it means what

406
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:38,300
you are talking is interesting but if a

407
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:40,830
person takes out both ear plugs

408
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:48,690
headphones it means that the person is

409
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:51,929
respecting you so of course the hackers

410
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:55,560
would actively use that we can talk

411
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:57,840
about social engineering and social atm

412
00:28:55,560 --> 00:29:01,830
it will be new types of attacks that we

413
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:04,290
are unaware of and to say that number of

414
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:08,399
threats increase and less successful

415
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:13,220
attacks yes we also confirm but it's

416
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:17,550
like the condensed and suppressed spring

417
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:20,640
the stronger you compress it it will

418
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:24,270
grow exponentially last year we had an

419
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:27,510
example you reduce the entry barrier for

420
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:31,350
clients for investors number of in tech

421
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:34,370
startups a lot but you need to

422
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:38,159
compensate that through increasing

423
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:41,570
security and instead of that we have in

424
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:47,130
tech organizations in Europe in Russia

425
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:49,419
in the United States who heard about

426
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:51,429
security from books

427
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:56,689
[Music]

428
00:29:51,429 --> 00:29:58,669
in our high street banks the security

429
00:29:56,689 --> 00:30:01,969
our former KGB and there

430
00:29:58,669 --> 00:30:05,659
these are heap tears who only heard

431
00:30:01,969 --> 00:30:09,469
about that with big eyes I heard stories

432
00:30:05,659 --> 00:30:12,229
about some crazy math processing in one

433
00:30:09,469 --> 00:30:16,099
of the FinTech startups that we work

434
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:19,249
with in England it's unbelievable in

435
00:30:16,099 --> 00:30:22,279
number of essences that are implemented

436
00:30:19,249 --> 00:30:24,739
in payment process the people who can

437
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:26,989
intercept your data personal data map

438
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:30,619
data whatever card data could be

439
00:30:26,989 --> 00:30:32,629
hundreds times more Apple pay in 2015 we

440
00:30:30,619 --> 00:30:35,988
were saying Apple pay guys listen this

441
00:30:32,629 --> 00:30:39,109
isn't isn't possible 2018 this attack

442
00:30:35,989 --> 00:30:40,639
happened before that Papa said come on

443
00:30:39,109 --> 00:30:43,849
we're aggregator we don't

444
00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:46,369
related to money there used as a tool

445
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:50,599
for fraud and okay and it's going to be

446
00:30:46,369 --> 00:30:53,178
everywhere grandmother's is going to be

447
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:56,658
top one clients of all the fraudsters

448
00:30:53,179 --> 00:30:57,379
who will steal money from them it was a

449
00:30:56,659 --> 00:31:01,839
crazy question

450
00:30:57,379 --> 00:31:06,228
why use Burbank Russia open pensioners

451
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:09,049
cars with NFC they're never used NFC and

452
00:31:06,229 --> 00:31:12,369
will never use it on the other hand it's

453
00:31:09,049 --> 00:31:17,119
good for the manager you will get their

454
00:31:12,369 --> 00:31:19,488
50 cents to open NFC card to grandmother

455
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:22,129
is good for the bank because in their

456
00:31:19,489 --> 00:31:24,589
annual report they'll say visa master

457
00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:28,009
devil sold 10 million cards instead of 5

458
00:31:24,589 --> 00:31:30,739
million cards so this hype was the only

459
00:31:28,009 --> 00:31:35,019
option to oppose this exponential

460
00:31:30,739 --> 00:31:39,019
logarithmic growth only during the break

461
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:41,529
to build more certification all devices

462
00:31:39,019 --> 00:31:46,009
because the number of gaps through which

463
00:31:41,529 --> 00:31:49,449
you will be entered will grow forever

464
00:31:46,009 --> 00:31:52,759
30 years ago the network of the choir

465
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:56,419
network who is a master card issuer were

466
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:59,809
trusted it was like a 7 10 20 years ago

467
00:31:56,419 --> 00:32:01,670
and now acquire tokenizer service

468
00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:03,649
provider accumulate

469
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:09,710
when and gets way longer than Network

470
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:13,480
and then five more this the food chain

471
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:17,750
became longer with is uncontrolled

472
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:22,820
uncontrollable most interesting with

473
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:26,720
some irresponsibility points as well I

474
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:30,470
would observe the following to build

475
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:33,950
fortifications is great but another

476
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:38,720
problem is not just in building fences

477
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:42,049
or something made of steel our

478
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:45,110
technologies have embedded security it's

479
00:32:42,049 --> 00:32:48,350
not like you have IT system around a

480
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:54,709
fence and a small door with a big lock

481
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:56,870
its last century now the security is in

482
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:59,210
the technology and the security may not

483
00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:02,000
work maybe

484
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:04,480
therefore we should add to this problem

485
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,610
the one that we can create technologies

486
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:11,720
which already contain an integrated

487
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:16,340
function of security maybe something

488
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:19,160
else maybe we can think of something so

489
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:22,879
we have something to work on but let's

490
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:26,630
get back to that so what happens down we

491
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:30,260
saw all the trends tools groups that

492
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:33,860
work only in infrastructure and IT

493
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:38,570
system of any lending organization in

494
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:43,549
our case or financial it's the same for

495
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:46,399
all the areas with different purposes in

496
00:33:43,549 --> 00:33:51,168
the heart of any organization which

497
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:58,590
provides services for the citizens which

498
00:33:51,169 --> 00:34:04,660
are ATMs phone apps computer any devices

499
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:07,510
and calls social engineering as a latest

500
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:14,550
trend what I'm trying to tell you

501
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:18,880
we have protected with reinforced steel

502
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:21,310
but those people who want to get money

503
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:25,540
away from us look at the whole picture

504
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:28,929
they want to try bypass so we have such

505
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:31,929
things as social engineering aside what

506
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:35,620
it is related to we have either

507
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:42,910
well-prepared hackers or not so

508
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:47,139
competent citizens in terms of security

509
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:51,609
literacy all self-service nothing

510
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:53,949
depends on the client it depends on how

511
00:34:51,610 --> 00:35:00,160
the device was impacted

512
00:34:53,949 --> 00:35:03,930
there were several cases one was related

513
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:07,000
of poor attention who approached the ATM

514
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:09,250
and not looking in the screen and third

515
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,400
the cart and the money started to be

516
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:14,950
withdrawn not so much of that more

517
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:19,600
interested in the black boxer type

518
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:24,779
attacks in ATM the main time is about 90

519
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:30,310
seconds the whole time of loading

520
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:35,470
response every bank knows 90 seconds so

521
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:41,290
the record is 60 seconds so the problem

522
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:44,970
is as the fin sack talks to producers or

523
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:48,640
vendors of the ATMs to the community or

524
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:56,020
write software we do not always see the

525
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:59,009
feedback as they cannot give us the talk

526
00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:03,460
and the communication is cool a

527
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:07,180
voluntary but those who have official

528
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:09,640
relations or any contracts I'm sure they

529
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:14,710
do have a feedback rights and that you

530
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:17,980
must have a broad network of ATMs I'm

531
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:21,880
sure there are some attacks on ATMs

532
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:26,470
right what do you think the trend goes

533
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:29,760
up or down versus last year so what we

534
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:36,339
should do I mean the whole community and

535
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:39,550
you as the operator of items or we as a

536
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:44,230
regulator what we you and I or we should

537
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:48,640
do to minimize the impact if you take a

538
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:54,210
look at the trends some time ago these

539
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:58,600
attacks of black box were indeed common

540
00:36:54,210 --> 00:37:02,290
when using SDG bus they wanted to get

541
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:05,350
connected and get money but that's - -

542
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:09,580
and stick on one hand a lot of vendors

543
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:14,560
started to provide solutions hardware

544
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:17,890
software and with my experience we see a

545
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:20,890
return on a debt vector to the classical

546
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:23,410
stealing the correct in information I

547
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:28,450
have the record of stealing from

548
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:29,980
physical ATM is 27 seconds black box six

549
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:33,410
to ninety seconds has correctly

550
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:42,790
mentioned so there's a fact

551
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:46,490
and minivan comes hooked and drives away

552
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:48,980
no quick response teams comes within two

553
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:58,029
two and a half minutes if you take a

554
00:37:48,980 --> 00:38:02,450
look at the traffic ways of minivan you

555
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:07,280
cannot catch it up on the other hand we

556
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:10,240
can minute ship video CCTV but it would

557
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:13,070
make the cost more expensive not always

558
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,620
security service or business unit is

559
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:21,290
prepared to pay money for these systems

560
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:25,549
it's easier to insure it ATMs three

561
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:29,360
million rubles $100,000 or $200,000

562
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:31,130
three five million at statistics it's

563
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:35,030
easier to pay insurance company small

564
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:39,140
amount in case of theft they repay the

565
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:41,990
cost of the ATM and money on one hand on

566
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:44,770
the other hand the trend we see I'm sure

567
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:51,430
you know about it it's led to

568
00:38:44,770 --> 00:39:03,320
vulnerabilities of the banknote

569
00:38:51,430 --> 00:39:13,000
receivers when the hacker come to ATM

570
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:16,850
and the five thousand banknotes and

571
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,470
moving onto a cart and the money is

572
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:22,960
withdrawn from the same card in another

573
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:22,959
ATM so as the fraudsters

574
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:31,950
use fake banknotes is the eternal fight

575
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:37,660
against the good and the evil

576
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:44,169
so the fraudsters by ATMs disassembled

577
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:49,109
and they try to improve the production

578
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:55,500
of fake banknotes for some of the ATMs

579
00:39:49,109 --> 00:40:00,460
money is through stalling some through

580
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:03,849
attacking card readers using this

581
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:08,440
opportunity I would like to say in the

582
00:40:03,849 --> 00:40:12,849
very beginning I made the hint about it

583
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:15,579
we have a problem of informing the

584
00:40:12,849 --> 00:40:18,460
players of using bad black box in the

585
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:23,049
ATMs so the question we are discussing

586
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:25,809
what to do as we are getting less

587
00:40:23,049 --> 00:40:31,599
information from different organizations

588
00:40:25,809 --> 00:40:37,180
financial organizations then should be

589
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:43,690
getting and it strongly impacts the

590
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:48,629
efficiency in counter measures so I urge

591
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:48,630
you let's make it better

592
00:40:51,040 --> 00:41:01,150
a bank told us nothing's bad to come but

593
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:03,700
I would like to learn an opinion from

594
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:07,690
you what do you think about it's about

595
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:11,350
black boxes we could fight against them

596
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:16,950
in terms of your competences maybe you

597
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:18,670
can suggest anything I will use a

598
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:22,020
timorous friend

599
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:22,020
don't forget the questions where for me

600
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:36,399
well I agree that this year physical

601
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:40,750
attacks went back and people stepped

602
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:43,210
away from high-tech attacks to ATMs

603
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:44,860
according to current statistics but

604
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:48,730
let's take a look at the end of the year

605
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:53,650
how it goes we touch wood there are no

606
00:41:48,730 --> 00:42:00,310
other ways of contracting to attacks

607
00:41:53,650 --> 00:42:02,920
rather by knocking wood right last year

608
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:05,620
those 50 years anniversary of or 6 years

609
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:10,590
anniversary of ATMs so during these

610
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:13,690
years we have been growing this bacteria

611
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:17,140
people understood black box black box is

612
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:21,990
easy and clear but it's still easier

613
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:26,200
hook an ATM or pump it with liquid gas

614
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:30,729
explode and run away reject cash I will

615
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:36,810
not offer that is that crazy things if I

616
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:36,810
say people will throw something to me

617
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:45,720
another point

618
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:48,720
I'm struck by cynical situation when

619
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:50,790
vendor knows everything when the vendor

620
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,589
is a very about everything but if the

621
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:57,740
vendor is approached by a small team of

622
00:42:52,589 --> 00:42:57,740
bank or small any other bank no matter

623
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:08,279
which are as many as mushrooms in the

624
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:11,069
forest and vendor can answer come on

625
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:13,740
guys we have an open market

626
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:16,619
that's the capitalism if you want buy

627
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:21,569
other hardware if you don't want buy

628
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:23,609
something else but if this Burbank or

629
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:28,290
Whidbey comes to the vendor they say

630
00:43:23,609 --> 00:43:32,720
Oaks ok let's do something and we and

631
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:37,950
this error K especially lab they exist

632
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:40,500
they are even invited ATM and we say ok

633
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:44,669
let us talk about security radians and

634
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:49,560
they say well we pro quo give us money

635
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:55,020
we give you a minute to speak soul

636
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:58,200
around money and we don't exist in this

637
00:43:55,020 --> 00:44:02,720
scheme the company positive technologies

638
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:08,399
we know that we are well known in Russia

639
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:11,549
for Visa MasterCard for them we are a

640
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:16,530
statistical bias statistical error so

641
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:19,619
need to develop Russian product SPM

642
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:24,240
Kaspersky they create security and phone

643
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:29,670
security which we successfully hack or

644
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:35,069
successfully don't hack actually that's

645
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:38,849
great so it's not the option the option

646
00:44:35,069 --> 00:44:43,470
goes to globalization or isolation so we

647
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:45,210
either create our own ATM Russian ATM as

648
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:48,890
Berbick wanted to establish

649
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:52,300
technological stack will be without cash

650
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:58,098
only with mere cards

651
00:44:52,300 --> 00:45:01,430
or we'll have power like with such

652
00:44:58,099 --> 00:45:10,280
people as with abyss Burbank insert and

653
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:12,490
others who have enough power to impact

654
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:17,200
in ten years

655
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:17,200
we turn into quasi-government

656
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:32,720
with more budgets than european

657
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:40,750
governments so probably the idea is that

658
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:40,750
we will have to do something with that

659
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:52,580
it's very nice when people tell about us

660
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:54,980
and when they say that they hack us but

661
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:57,500
we try to approach responsibly and fix

662
00:45:54,980 --> 00:46:00,500
it talking about black box and talking

663
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:06,109
to Western vendors it's all bullshit

664
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:09,020
because the answer the reply you're

665
00:46:06,109 --> 00:46:12,319
right ok this coding in this incident

666
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:15,680
this money was stolen and the answer so

667
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:19,820
what you're right ok guys you need to

668
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:23,960
protect update ATMs and that's all they

669
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:26,089
say we cannot advise the bank to update

670
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:29,150
several thousands of ATMs they don't

671
00:46:26,089 --> 00:46:32,029
have money let them take a loan as the

672
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:35,119
complete bullshit is going on also what

673
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:37,849
we try to impact through ATM by its

674
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:40,250
association of ATM producers another

675
00:46:37,849 --> 00:46:42,530
association is yes and it's in

676
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:46,390
organization in particular European

677
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:46,390
banks when there are several times

678
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:53,259
saying if you think Russia is ignored no

679
00:46:50,839 --> 00:46:56,710
way everybody's ignored

680
00:46:53,260 --> 00:47:00,300
and the conversation is nothing but

681
00:46:56,710 --> 00:47:05,170
money in the whole idea if the money is

682
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:08,220
stolen ensure them like you said and

683
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:12,100
then insurance companies will increase

684
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:14,350
the the fee and then they start

685
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:18,960
increasing increasing and would be a

686
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:22,600
question shall you maintain the old

687
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:26,050
vulnerable ATMs or it's time to buy new

688
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:30,040
ones and then the trade-off what

689
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:32,770
business so far the situation is like

690
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:35,890
that understand what is the irony the

691
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:40,990
irony is that they say yes updates to

692
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:43,720
new ATMs unless you show them you sell

693
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:47,020
your ATM for $50,000 but they have the

694
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:52,980
same problems as before you have turned

695
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:55,930
TLS learn to creep from DC Protocol but

696
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:59,530
vulnerabilities are still there and then

697
00:47:55,930 --> 00:48:01,680
they go to complete stuck and they say

698
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:07,240
up top they say do you have incidents

699
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:09,940
yes in Latin America last year they are

700
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:14,080
based on incidents now imagine the story

701
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:17,109
about incidents it drives me mad can

702
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:20,880
imagine a big multi-billion American

703
00:48:17,109 --> 00:48:24,040
company anyone who has a back bounds

704
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:28,030
program like Amazon PayPal Microsoft

705
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:30,730
whomever you write them like security

706
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:33,460
researcher you write a report say you

707
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:37,720
guys that's something we found please

708
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:41,640
fix like free code or something

709
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:44,980
something critical and they would reply

710
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:48,790
have you seen that in the wild if you

711
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:51,880
haven't we will probably sit and wait

712
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:55,540
nobody will ever do that but why

713
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:57,610
financial organizations are allowed to

714
00:48:55,540 --> 00:49:05,200
act like this

715
00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:10,480
because they can afford because they can

716
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:16,149
miss Johnson understand that the Moore's

717
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:21,960
position the difficulties - even before

718
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:21,960
the fin search I was looking into ATMs

719
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:35,710
issues around them and ATM was not an

720
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:39,220
asset but rather a liability there are

721
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:41,440
many things receivers boxes the boards

722
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:47,430
with keyboards we had different things

723
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:50,410
but that's one part but we have brave

724
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:52,270
users of financial services and this

725
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:56,680
would be the most important question

726
00:49:52,270 --> 00:50:02,830
because we're not just people who work

727
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:09,009
in financial companies but we are using

728
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:13,290
the services - so we have a case well

729
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:13,290
telephone fraud will be later well

730
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:21,910
according to the recent trends scanning

731
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:25,270
shimming goes to the past's is not

732
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:30,600
interesting what was new coming maybe we

733
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:35,410
don't know about something Sergey well

734
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:39,009
scheming shimming whatever you call the

735
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:42,670
self-service devices become less and

736
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:49,150
that so because of a great service which

737
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:52,240
is called card to card why do we have to

738
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:55,690
walk around streets of towns and cities

739
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:59,620
and villages and collect card slips when

740
00:50:55,690 --> 00:51:00,690
you can just ask a person to enter the

741
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:06,220
card number

742
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:09,950
CVV a code and that's all

743
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:14,950
as soon as the payment system starts and

744
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:19,629
again many sites and internet like VIP

745
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:19,629
cinemas doesn't matter

746
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:33,010
the doing something but as a result they

747
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:39,560
have nothing so now we have a situation

748
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:44,200
why we need to buy something in a Bay we

749
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:49,670
can do a fishing site but a forum

750
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:52,870
connect car to cart service and after

751
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:56,690
that you sit in the earn money you start

752
00:51:52,870 --> 00:52:00,140
being locked and you say okay I will go

753
00:51:56,690 --> 00:52:02,540
and open another account I'll have one

754
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:11,390
more card and it goes forever and that's

755
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:15,310
why less scheming with Apple pay when we

756
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:15,310
have SmartWatch yes

757
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:22,910
it's an example when you reduce the

758
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:27,650
entry barrier for a mobile payment

759
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:30,430
terminal can be entered by any person in

760
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:30,430
Latin America

761
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:45,910
[Music]

762
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:48,940
number of banks call me and say why

763
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:52,420
authorizations for $0 was that we have

764
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:54,820
thousands of selections CV is wrong and

765
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:59,680
as far as Inc is something different one

766
00:52:54,820 --> 00:53:02,260
one figure one digit because we miss Co

767
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:04,720
claret expert it and only because of

768
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:10,450
that Bank lost tens of thousands of

769
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:14,830
rubles with this spreading bombing

770
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:16,839
Kartik artists great you reduce the

771
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:20,290
entry barrier Bank of Russia reduced

772
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:23,170
that before only think of before think

773
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:28,090
of Karthik art was not existing in

774
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:30,609
Russia and now 2019 you know just

775
00:53:28,090 --> 00:53:34,390
nonsense with Bank has no such service

776
00:53:30,609 --> 00:53:37,540
and it means that US bank issuer the

777
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:41,230
service cards cards it can come from any

778
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:43,509
world you don't know what is that is

779
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:46,119
card to card PayPal card to card think

780
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:49,180
of any other organizations and peers

781
00:53:46,119 --> 00:53:53,380
terminals Latin America places were

782
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:56,160
physical access and weapons are just

783
00:53:53,380 --> 00:54:01,510
serious arguments that will introduce

784
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:08,790
digitalization we have many other

785
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:08,790
services that are in Internet resources

786
00:54:18,809 --> 00:54:32,130
said the chest so what shall we do with

787
00:54:25,019 --> 00:54:33,089
that what about financial services our

788
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:35,369
bank

789
00:54:33,089 --> 00:54:36,869
do you have an experience we are

790
00:54:35,369 --> 00:54:38,819
collecting thoughts together

791
00:54:36,869 --> 00:54:40,769
and then we will decide what to do about

792
00:54:38,819 --> 00:54:43,619
it and then maybe somebody will ask us a

793
00:54:40,769 --> 00:54:51,390
question or car to cart people got used

794
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:56,400
to it it's been popular is predator

795
00:54:51,390 --> 00:55:00,239
answers in Russia is rare but there is

796
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:02,729
fine similar schemers we thought it will

797
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:06,419
go to regions but they disappeared maybe

798
00:55:02,729 --> 00:55:12,259
they don't have sense right the reading

799
00:55:06,419 --> 00:55:12,259
is done differently POS terminals

800
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:45,150
reducing but what shall we do to reduce

801
00:55:32,249 --> 00:55:48,299
it what else could be done there must be

802
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:51,259
centers which would coordinate the range

803
00:55:48,299 --> 00:55:55,140
of issues from A to Z ten instances

804
00:55:51,259 --> 00:55:57,959
paying payment process now we have the

805
00:55:55,140 --> 00:56:00,328
final victim is a personal account or

806
00:55:57,959 --> 00:56:04,288
the money of owner of the bank's money

807
00:56:00,329 --> 00:56:06,269
or issuers money and the rest it's not

808
00:56:04,289 --> 00:56:10,049
their money they get they will

809
00:56:06,269 --> 00:56:11,698
Commission there are five 10% 1% 2% but

810
00:56:10,049 --> 00:56:15,869
the money at the end of the day the so

811
00:56:11,699 --> 00:56:19,949
there's there's no single body which

812
00:56:15,869 --> 00:56:25,120
would come and say guys well there is

813
00:56:19,949 --> 00:56:28,150
one body ie they have central bank

814
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:31,630
which are trying to correlate this but

815
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:36,040
there's no guy whom you come and say

816
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:38,230
well in England so sorry is there's a

817
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:40,090
fin tech startup I was looking for

818
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:42,850
Roland abilities there and then make a

819
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:45,580
transfer card to card I was charged

820
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:49,480
hundred dollars it was supposed to fill

821
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:51,040
hundred dollars to another cards I was

822
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:54,250
taking hundred dollars from both I call

823
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,700
the bank and they say I don't understand

824
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:58,120
you

825
00:56:54,700 --> 00:57:01,210
second bank no and they say there is a

826
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:03,279
Financial Ombudsman you go to him create

827
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:07,140
an application can have years pass and

828
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:13,540
get your hundred pounds back to the

829
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:18,970
result if we have such a body whom you

830
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:23,410
complain about bad banks bad POS there

831
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:24,790
are some most of us says guys you have

832
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:28,540
seen in the world

833
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:34,779
POS terminals you can Church click to

834
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:38,830
and pin tell us will will punch them

835
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:42,570
other guys says oh we don't care in

836
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:47,049
addition to ATM we have post terminals

837
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:49,750
that you can buy the whole shop we have

838
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:56,100
fishing resources which are called car

839
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:58,570
to cartridge transfers and thanks to you

840
00:57:56,100 --> 00:58:05,710
last year we had two and a half

841
00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:08,800
thousands something 2000 resources were

842
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:12,460
blocked it's a good indicator but it we

843
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:17,730
need to cover it closer so purse

844
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:20,890
terminals ATMs oh we missed mobile

845
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:23,680
devices that's what is the most

846
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:26,160
interesting people go to ATMs to

847
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,160
withdraw cash

848
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:34,260
but other transactions go through mobile

849
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:39,140
phone to computer better mobile phone is

850
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:45,540
better used then the question whether

851
00:58:39,140 --> 00:59:00,270
iOS or platform or Android or others are

852
00:58:45,540 --> 00:59:05,600
known yet there are some advantages

853
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:10,830
disadvantages rule Act I asked Pavel the

854
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:14,400
general view onto problem of mobile

855
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:19,490
devices as a way of having financial

856
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:23,220
transactions what you had the research

857
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:33,629
among the community members what general

858
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:40,830
trends we have so it's simple there yes

859
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:46,590
now what we see was the trend of all

860
00:59:40,830 --> 00:59:50,670
devices what do you mean as they enter

861
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:53,280
our lives more and more is it going to

862
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:56,460
bring more danger yes of course because

863
00:59:53,280 --> 01:00:02,490
that's exactly what our colleagues from

864
00:59:56,460 --> 01:00:07,170
banking said we have more available

865
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:12,620
accessible general bank servicing

866
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:15,460
there's a problem of public awareness of

867
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:19,819
cyber

868
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:23,119
literacy a younger son gives the mobile

869
01:00:19,819 --> 01:00:27,710
phone to mother and explains how to pay

870
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:31,460
for the apartment to her his rate

871
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:35,450
she learns but nobody talks about the

872
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:45,680
security why shall seen you know about

873
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:50,569
it in fact I came to a point of view and

874
01:00:45,680 --> 01:01:04,910
my colleagues will support me the main

875
01:00:50,569 --> 01:01:10,099
point for attack is the person the

876
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:17,240
projects from Finn cert includes working

877
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:22,880
with population recently we had a cycle

878
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:28,129
of lectures for say of people aged 50

879
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:31,400
plus or even 60 plus what was nice to

880
01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:36,799
acknowledge those who read lectures on

881
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:40,579
IT security for this audience received

882
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:45,490
big interest from the feedback people

883
01:01:40,579 --> 01:01:45,490
are willing to learn

884
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:55,490
most of lending our own financial

885
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,650
organizations feel better to sell the

886
01:01:55,490 --> 01:01:59,720
products rather than to explain risks

887
01:01:57,650 --> 01:02:02,000
and teach how to use the security

888
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:05,299
products in the number of grandfather's

889
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:09,290
grandmother's who get their pension to

890
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:13,430
their cards and get mobile phone to pay

891
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:17,119
for their utility services now is high

892
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:22,598
and is growing more and more simply

893
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:27,590
because our society is digitalized and

894
01:02:22,599 --> 01:02:31,280
efforts of banks to individuals security

895
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:34,090
I don't see any interest or efforts from

896
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:36,890
the banks to do that there are some

897
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:40,790
financial sector representatives to

898
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:44,060
improve the digital awareness what I'm

899
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:48,140
trying to say need to merge and join our

900
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:53,990
forces as to Mourinho's of correctly

901
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:58,790
said during the quiet time we must be

902
01:02:53,990 --> 01:03:02,930
prepared for the explosion to come by

903
01:02:58,790 --> 01:03:06,190
and this explosion will cover the most

904
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:06,190
vulnerable people

905
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:14,799
the problem is that people are not

906
01:03:13,930 --> 01:03:18,940
stupid

907
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:21,550
but they're lazy if a person got stolen

908
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:23,950
someone it he is lazy to go right

909
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:27,700
application he said okay I paid for my

910
01:03:23,950 --> 01:03:33,759
stupidity and forgot about it and it

911
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:37,419
prevents from from doing something about

912
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:42,190
it and catching the bad guys I wanted to

913
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:45,640
ask from Alexander your situation with

914
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:50,740
operations through dbo devices in this

915
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:57,700
case mobile devices looks you know what

916
01:03:50,740 --> 01:04:01,060
extent figures what do you do to make it

917
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:05,770
smaller so what trends are trends are

918
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:07,960
possible maybe you see this year the

919
01:04:05,770 --> 01:04:10,210
development of payment services and

920
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:12,130
mobile phone producers and mobile

921
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:15,970
platforms the situation has changed

922
01:04:12,130 --> 01:04:20,280
radically getting back like 20 years ago

923
01:04:15,970 --> 01:04:24,100
everybody that used to walk with the

924
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:27,190
cash books if you watch movies the right

925
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:27,960
to check if you watch a movie catch me

926
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:36,700
if you can

927
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:39,640
he learned to fake signatures in

928
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:45,960
financial institutions of the US if we

929
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:49,060
look into closest past 15 20 years ago

930
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:50,440
everybody started to move from cheque

931
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:54,190
books to plastic cards

932
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:56,590
I've been training clients that number

933
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:58,660
of card contains information about the

934
01:04:56,590 --> 01:05:02,320
bank card number is not confidential but

935
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:06,390
the requisites card number expiry date

936
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:06,390
name and

937
01:05:07,819 --> 01:05:27,779
the last three digits in the back of the

938
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:32,720
cards so developing Apple Google Samsung

939
01:05:27,779 --> 01:05:32,720
pay the situation got evolution again

940
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:41,279
you don't have to carry a wallet with

941
01:05:37,799 --> 01:05:44,730
the cards you need to be charged phone

942
01:05:41,279 --> 01:05:46,339
with modern mobile platform all your

943
01:05:44,730 --> 01:05:49,799
payment cards are uploaded there or

944
01:05:46,339 --> 01:05:52,279
discounters are uploaded there so the

945
01:05:49,799 --> 01:05:55,710
phone becomes this vulnerable place

946
01:05:52,279 --> 01:05:59,130
which is quite critical and there the

947
01:05:55,710 --> 01:06:02,240
job of the banks and the problem of

948
01:05:59,130 --> 01:06:06,380
clients is to treat this device as

949
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:10,200
careful maintaining the hygiene as

950
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:13,319
people used to treat other tools before

951
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:14,669
and like passport keep it protected I'm

952
01:06:13,319 --> 01:06:18,150
not talking about such primitive

953
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:21,299
measures as having antivirus although as

954
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:24,319
the experience shows half of mobile

955
01:06:21,299 --> 01:06:28,170
platform users they don't have antivirus

956
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:30,930
after that have some preventive training

957
01:06:28,170 --> 01:06:34,500
or courses and say if you have

958
01:06:30,930 --> 01:06:42,348
respective email and linked apk file

959
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:42,349
don't install it don't make setting

960
01:06:42,829 --> 01:06:51,210
download not only from the official

961
01:06:47,309 --> 01:06:56,460
program sites and sources so please

962
01:06:51,210 --> 01:06:58,680
treat your phone not as the tool to make

963
01:06:56,460 --> 01:07:00,390
a phone calls but a tool for financial

964
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:02,098
transactions that's from the users point

965
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:05,730
of view from the bank's point of view

966
01:07:02,099 --> 01:07:08,039
they also face a big problem how to make

967
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:12,539
sure that the payment service is

968
01:07:08,039 --> 01:07:15,450
comfortable but mobile and safe and have

969
01:07:12,539 --> 01:07:18,910
new technologies coming turn to to help

970
01:07:15,450 --> 01:07:20,740
because modern technologies allow too

971
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:22,029
collect a lot of parametric and

972
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:25,118
statistical data about the user

973
01:07:22,029 --> 01:07:28,269
encircled behavior analysts take all

974
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:33,509
platforms of Symbian or even ancient

975
01:07:28,269 --> 01:07:36,788
phones we couldn't get phone number

976
01:07:33,509 --> 01:07:40,109
device identifier it was not possible to

977
01:07:36,789 --> 01:07:45,400
get from the OS now there's no problem

978
01:07:40,109 --> 01:07:50,160
so P of Android and Apple to know about

979
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:50,160
Windows Apple Android have a lot of

980
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:58,509
collection of this information and

981
01:07:55,829 --> 01:08:00,809
number of mobile apps they offer to

982
01:07:58,509 --> 01:08:04,539
appliance they are actively using this

983
01:08:00,809 --> 01:08:06,819
that's why the banks must implement and

984
01:08:04,539 --> 01:08:09,940
actively use systems of behavioral

985
01:08:06,819 --> 01:08:13,000
analysis before we were using classical

986
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:15,220
anti-fraud logic financial transaction

987
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,738
now we need to move to analysis of not

988
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:20,830
just financial transactions and they're

989
01:08:17,738 --> 01:08:24,809
suspicious in terms of around whatever

990
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:28,540
but devices to the user

991
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:33,719
recently was always using iOS platform

992
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:40,149
and getting the charge we have the

993
01:08:33,719 --> 01:08:43,980
Android the bank must use a trigger or a

994
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:47,080
system we should call back to a user

995
01:08:43,979 --> 01:08:53,229
saying are you sure you moved from

996
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:56,469
iPhone to any huawei or whatever to

997
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:59,589
other technologies of reading these

998
01:08:56,469 --> 01:09:03,489
technologies we have it all but we need

999
01:08:59,589 --> 01:09:06,549
to implement respective tools and force

1000
01:09:03,488 --> 01:09:12,309
people to use in the bank let me say

1001
01:09:06,549 --> 01:09:14,889
that to call the client and ask yes on

1002
01:09:12,310 --> 01:09:17,290
the federal loan 97

1003
01:09:14,889 --> 01:09:20,618
it's not the point of moving from one

1004
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:23,830
platform to another as a trait of course

1005
01:09:20,618 --> 01:09:27,849
the regulator my country a regulator is

1006
01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:32,500
moving the same direction so legal

1007
01:09:27,850 --> 01:09:36,029
documents from regulators confirming the

1008
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:39,580
need of removing this information

1009
01:09:36,029 --> 01:09:43,179
reading this information so the banks

1010
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:47,229
must have systems that connect mic

1011
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:51,520
addresses and device fingerprints from

1012
01:09:47,229 --> 01:09:54,189
which there's the entry into device for

1013
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:57,400
a financial transaction this is right

1014
01:09:54,189 --> 01:10:03,719
you don't have to stop and you have to

1015
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:07,330
improve the legislation and improve the

1016
01:10:03,719 --> 01:10:10,719
population literacy oh yes we are moving

1017
01:10:07,330 --> 01:10:13,330
there we realize that we have a lot of

1018
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:18,010
problems and mobile devices and now

1019
01:10:13,330 --> 01:10:21,489
let's ask those who are not a bank or a

1020
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:25,449
financial institution to could do

1021
01:10:21,489 --> 01:10:31,379
something to make these things rare and

1022
01:10:25,449 --> 01:10:34,839
rare can anyone from our vendors can you

1023
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:38,830
create mobile system which would allow

1024
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:44,010
us to avoid these things this is a 50/50

1025
01:10:38,830 --> 01:10:44,010
provocative no philosophical question

1026
01:10:44,909 --> 01:10:55,900
there's no limit to perfection it's a

1027
01:10:51,610 --> 01:10:59,469
matter of time needed to establish such

1028
01:10:55,900 --> 01:11:01,388
platform how many iterations must be

1029
01:10:59,469 --> 01:11:04,780
done must be done to analyze the

1030
01:11:01,389 --> 01:11:08,940
platform and the application were

1031
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:08,940
working with developers and so on so

1032
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:17,650
security must be starting by design but

1033
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:20,469
depending on how hackers think of new

1034
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:25,159
hints and offense how to steal money

1035
01:11:20,469 --> 01:11:28,010
I don't believe honestly speaking

1036
01:11:25,159 --> 01:11:34,790
there's no hundred percent protected

1037
01:11:28,010 --> 01:11:39,440
system but I don't know maybe what could

1038
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:40,780
be changed there in architecture to

1039
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:45,379
minimize it

1040
01:11:40,780 --> 01:12:02,989
maybe fantasy it may also have a right

1041
01:11:45,380 --> 01:12:07,900
to live so there's there are great

1042
01:12:02,989 --> 01:12:11,509
examples Android and iOS so for Android

1043
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:14,900
malware an incident related to stealing

1044
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:19,659
of money using malware with Android

1045
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:19,659
there are many many everywhere for RS

1046
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:28,120
statistical errors and the latest

1047
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:33,260
incidents or they spoke with the phone

1048
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:35,900
my money SMS from the bank was

1049
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:40,580
intercepted by malware they are not

1050
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:43,580
confirmed if I fantasize about OS

1051
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:50,059
platforms let's let's see what Apple did

1052
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:55,699
Apple did great thing they said we do OS

1053
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:59,360
and phones and we don't give anyone this

1054
01:12:55,699 --> 01:13:03,049
OS and no other OS will use this phones

1055
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:06,409
and Android producers as Google said

1056
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:07,370
however ours will work everywhere these

1057
01:13:06,409 --> 01:13:11,239
phones

1058
01:13:07,370 --> 01:13:14,239
anyone can produce some songs away

1059
01:13:11,239 --> 01:13:18,799
whatever and they put this OS so

1060
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:21,830
developers more users or whatever and

1061
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:29,840
our hackers too if you want to protect

1062
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:32,440
something this some unique phone or we

1063
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:32,440
have Arora

1064
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:39,860
I remember about protected mobile device

1065
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:49,880
you must do the following limited the

1066
01:13:43,770 --> 01:13:49,880
way so that there nobody will write to

1067
01:13:51,350 --> 01:14:02,190
if you work with banks accounts to avoid

1068
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:06,350
installing free toy Angry Birds for

1069
01:14:02,190 --> 01:14:10,710
example if you're using this telephone

1070
01:14:06,350 --> 01:14:13,260
to have one time codes to avoid you

1071
01:14:10,710 --> 01:14:15,810
using having a program which would allow

1072
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:17,580
you to use emoji and SMS messages

1073
01:14:15,810 --> 01:14:21,780
because these programs could be

1074
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:26,070
intercepted one-time passwords so it

1075
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:31,139
looks like we need to have trusted

1076
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:38,190
certain OS which is not Android ok

1077
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:40,350
square away recently came across problem

1078
01:14:38,190 --> 01:14:43,830
with their devices and we need to have

1079
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:49,260
developers who would go for developing

1080
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:56,340
an app for this OS and then the matters

1081
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:58,950
of matching and smaller things this must

1082
01:14:56,340 --> 01:15:03,210
be new system right with the code with

1083
01:14:58,950 --> 01:15:06,570
architecture but whatever toehold you

1084
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:09,510
having one has 50,000 phones we have one

1085
01:15:06,570 --> 01:15:12,299
phone for this for games second phone

1086
01:15:09,510 --> 01:15:14,970
for that and the set of depositories and

1087
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:19,280
one for each intention and use and

1088
01:15:14,970 --> 01:15:23,610
access rights right my critical oh I

1089
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:28,909
don't even know where to take them we

1090
01:15:23,610 --> 01:15:32,420
can do that but nobody will use it why

1091
01:15:28,909 --> 01:15:34,549
it goes for a simplification I would

1092
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:37,460
have a phone if I don't see this

1093
01:15:34,550 --> 01:15:39,860
architecture I don't care a system let

1094
01:15:37,460 --> 01:15:42,679
it perform what is is what is the

1095
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:47,360
difference it's a matter of balance

1096
01:15:42,679 --> 01:15:50,929
between financial technologies and

1097
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:57,830
comfort to use and discomfort that users

1098
01:15:50,929 --> 01:16:03,380
have in terms of security whatever using

1099
01:15:57,830 --> 01:16:07,100
this first idea from no sphere that came

1100
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:09,409
to us it maybe will be transformed to be

1101
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:12,080
mature built will see everything might

1102
01:16:09,409 --> 01:16:13,570
happen somebody will write it down and

1103
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:17,210
do it

1104
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:20,059
so talk about it I don't believe in

1105
01:16:17,210 --> 01:16:23,420
absolute security but minimizing risks

1106
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:27,980
is quite achievable and I think this has

1107
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:29,360
a future we have mathematical finish

1108
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:32,900
since coming to zero

1109
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:38,030
everything has right to live it's not so

1110
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:40,580
scary but we spoke about so scary things

1111
01:16:38,030 --> 01:16:47,719
everybody will go and withdraw cash

1112
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:51,830
right now let me tell you about things

1113
01:16:47,719 --> 01:16:56,650
I've heard despite of me knowing about

1114
01:16:51,830 --> 01:16:56,650
them so what we did we did a big thing

1115
01:16:57,850 --> 01:17:04,510
we closed heart a favorite organization

1116
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:08,750
[Music]

1117
01:17:04,510 --> 01:17:12,830
so it was successful we are standing on

1118
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:16,130
the right way of closing up the devices

1119
01:17:12,830 --> 01:17:19,300
that are connected to this heart we are

1120
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:19,300
in a way of

1121
01:17:20,610 --> 01:17:32,969
on the path of improving literacy in

1122
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:37,480
terms of using financial technologists a

1123
01:17:32,969 --> 01:17:41,650
lot of work to do and will do to get and

1124
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:46,299
probably we are on the right way in

1125
01:17:41,650 --> 01:17:55,000
thoughts and ideas about creating our

1126
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:57,579
own domestic devices in terms of

1127
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:02,670
platform but we have one big question

1128
01:17:57,579 --> 01:18:07,540
left two speakers I will tell you this

1129
01:18:02,670 --> 01:18:11,770
from Vint Cerf Heights we are not going

1130
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:13,750
down to do this because the status was

1131
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:15,550
not defined on the government level yet

1132
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:19,840
but nevertheless many organizations are

1133
01:18:15,550 --> 01:18:24,329
trying to use it apply somewhere I'm

1134
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:29,320
talking about the blockchain whatever

1135
01:18:24,329 --> 01:18:35,579
understand the community is a big going

1136
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:41,650
forward I would like to ask Sergey what

1137
01:18:35,579 --> 01:18:45,969
risks we can get when we implement this

1138
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:49,989
technology actually we've been very

1139
01:18:45,969 --> 01:18:53,079
careful around phone fraud well we'll

1140
01:18:49,989 --> 01:18:55,000
have the bite of the phone fraud at the

1141
01:18:53,079 --> 01:18:57,880
end oh I've got afraid we immediately

1142
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:00,210
went to the Crips no what was wrong with

1143
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:00,210
the Crips

1144
01:19:01,510 --> 01:19:10,340
cryptography I mean it's a funny thing

1145
01:19:04,510 --> 01:19:13,220
is going to be developing for sure what

1146
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:17,380
problems they have now problems which

1147
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:21,050
are not academic like mathematics or

1148
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:27,140
cryptography but the assault based

1149
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:29,000
problems with the stealing similar was

1150
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:33,890
saying he was talking about Latin

1151
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:36,560
America FinTech startups etc these

1152
01:19:33,890 --> 01:19:39,830
FinTech startups become victims of

1153
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:47,630
fraudsters and hackers they become

1154
01:19:39,830 --> 01:19:50,780
victims of standard attacks if a bank

1155
01:19:47,630 --> 01:19:53,360
would face this attack they would not

1156
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:56,059
even notice - it simply blockage but a

1157
01:19:53,360 --> 01:20:01,040
startup it kills them immediately and

1158
01:19:56,060 --> 01:20:04,480
then the big hacks because a lot of

1159
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:07,310
people who want to earn money from

1160
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:08,500
cryptocurrencies become victims what

1161
01:20:07,310 --> 01:20:12,700
happens then

1162
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:15,620
number of academic attacks on

1163
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:21,170
mathematics and blockchain technology

1164
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:23,420
would grow an amount of mess in

1165
01:20:21,170 --> 01:20:28,070
implementing the blockchain with nothing

1166
01:20:23,420 --> 01:20:32,930
but grow and the number of victims would

1167
01:20:28,070 --> 01:20:35,719
grow a number of hackers which used this

1168
01:20:32,930 --> 01:20:38,750
cryptocurrencies or whatever you call it

1169
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:42,440
crop the processing would also grow and

1170
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:47,240
the must be sooner later come to level

1171
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:49,339
of security which is fine with stock

1172
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:52,969
exchanges and processing okay do you

1173
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:59,570
have any opinion to share

1174
01:20:52,970 --> 01:21:03,110
yes blockchain is a good technology it's

1175
01:20:59,570 --> 01:21:08,030
bad that you started to try to attach it

1176
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:11,889
to any piece of our life somewhere it is

1177
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:11,889
useful and somewhere else

1178
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:22,840
is too close maybe even harmful very

1179
01:21:17,690 --> 01:21:26,179
very harmful they are trying to pull it

1180
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:28,580
close so hard well I think this

1181
01:21:26,180 --> 01:21:32,180
technology I agree with Sergei it would

1182
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:37,519
be used more and more they'll try to

1183
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:41,270
adopt it more and more to current tasks

1184
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:43,390
and it could be used by hackers more and

1185
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:48,350
more based on blockchain there is a

1186
01:21:43,390 --> 01:21:51,920
registration of coin is great Artyom

1187
01:21:48,350 --> 01:21:54,290
they buy domains in that endpoint in

1188
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:58,960
addition to our TM they have other

1189
01:21:54,290 --> 01:22:01,850
malware and they love to use domains

1190
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:06,320
registered those like a great

1191
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:10,450
alternative system which doesn't work so

1192
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:12,290
easy the mechanism of delegating domains

1193
01:22:10,450 --> 01:22:16,400
unfortunately not available in other

1194
01:22:12,290 --> 01:22:20,090
countries it's no longer working that's

1195
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:24,980
why new technology which will work but

1196
01:22:20,090 --> 01:22:26,420
the benefits and the opposite way -

1197
01:22:24,980 --> 01:22:31,269
that's a new reality

1198
01:22:26,420 --> 01:22:34,700
now sudden questions about mobile fraud

1199
01:22:31,270 --> 01:22:39,020
why did I do it because this phone calls

1200
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:40,790
that happen they happen unexpectedly we

1201
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:43,940
didn't do any transactions in the bank

1202
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:46,610
and they call you with the first name

1203
01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:48,769
they speak all the language and then the

1204
01:22:46,610 --> 01:22:54,710
person started to break that's the

1205
01:22:48,770 --> 01:22:58,880
effect of unexpected approach so how to

1206
01:22:54,710 --> 01:23:02,600
deal with that we are discussing it

1207
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:06,350
maybe there is another way in addition

1208
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:09,580
to people maybe technical way maybe a

1209
01:23:06,350 --> 01:23:12,260
program I don't know well about

1210
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:14,139
technical fight against this course

1211
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:18,940
mobile operators

1212
01:23:14,139 --> 01:23:21,159
say refused the secrecy of exchange of

1213
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:25,419
emails and will organize everything for

1214
01:23:21,159 --> 01:23:27,730
you rewrite the law on communications

1215
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:31,440
and we will do everything for you five

1216
01:23:27,730 --> 01:23:36,599
minutes to program no you cannot

1217
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:36,599
then there's investigation people are

1218
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:47,730
claiming and people write a lot that the

1219
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:56,020
money are gone if you don't have access

1220
01:23:47,730 --> 01:23:59,559
to hackers we don't know how much money

1221
01:23:56,020 --> 01:24:03,000
they stole so the problem becomes that

1222
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:06,639
it all goes international and as

1223
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:12,719
international cooperation with law

1224
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:12,719
enforcement depends on the policy alot

1225
01:24:15,810 --> 01:24:25,739
it cannot be resolved then regular

1226
01:24:21,869 --> 01:24:33,519
citizens become victims

1227
01:24:25,739 --> 01:24:36,459
technically let me say it in a hidden

1228
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:41,350
way there are some problems for Android

1229
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:44,260
and iOS which define to see whether

1230
01:24:41,350 --> 01:24:46,330
there are claims for fraud from these

1231
01:24:44,260 --> 01:24:51,100
mobile devices or not was it noticed

1232
01:24:46,330 --> 01:24:52,989
anywhere before or not and now this is

1233
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:57,940
what we can do here now install these

1234
01:24:52,989 --> 01:25:00,099
programs and sit and wait when it when

1235
01:24:57,940 --> 01:25:03,250
it protects you if not how much time it

1236
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:05,739
takes for such a number that people call

1237
01:25:03,250 --> 01:25:11,679
you from I'm talking not about the

1238
01:25:05,739 --> 01:25:15,159
replacement of a number how much time it

1239
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:17,600
takes since this information about this

1240
01:25:15,159 --> 01:25:25,049
number those

1241
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:25,740
normally soon but in your database else

1242
01:25:25,050 --> 01:25:32,360
user

1243
01:25:25,740 --> 01:25:35,160
yeah well in a moment of it phone call

1244
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:42,750
until our servers two seconds

1245
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:46,110
backwards KPI is one second it goes

1246
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:50,900
minute Li to this database so that

1247
01:25:46,110 --> 01:25:55,969
somebody notices as spam or a fraud look

1248
01:25:50,900 --> 01:26:00,660
it's very stupid logic down a logic of

1249
01:25:55,970 --> 01:26:04,440
decision-making sometimes this phone

1250
01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:07,880
number is in a whitelist so in a

1251
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:10,830
whitelist takes one second milliseconds

1252
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:15,600
so it's immediately is further for the

1253
01:26:10,830 --> 01:26:18,960
same thing with the black numbers when

1254
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:19,850
we add our database and then it doesn't

1255
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:24,900
go anywhere

1256
01:26:19,850 --> 01:26:30,060
red-flag you pick up the phone of you

1257
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:35,099
wants but it's true for the date becomes

1258
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:40,020
replications or this information comes

1259
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:42,180
from the operator I don't want to get

1260
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:44,700
with the phone operators there's

1261
01:26:42,180 --> 01:26:48,020
agreement with the big three but mainly

1262
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:50,280
it must be done with your own equipment

1263
01:26:48,020 --> 01:26:55,250
you cannot be based on the phone

1264
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:55,250
operator because this program could be

1265
01:26:55,580 --> 01:27:04,440
in any country client can accept license

1266
01:27:01,650 --> 01:27:08,250
agreement and it's fine okay do you have

1267
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:11,660
any thoughts about it not if you compare

1268
01:27:08,250 --> 01:27:11,660
with the phone of return

1269
01:27:12,670 --> 01:27:17,080
apparatus don't provide feedback and you

1270
01:27:15,610 --> 01:27:19,500
never know whether they accepted this

1271
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:22,210
information confirmed it and you will

1272
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:24,790
you will guess but when you are

1273
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:27,480
responsible on yourself is really more

1274
01:27:24,790 --> 01:27:30,790
effective and fast you can wait until

1275
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:33,669
the hacker change the number and you get

1276
01:27:30,790 --> 01:27:35,230
the feedback from the operator yeah so

1277
01:27:33,670 --> 01:27:37,860
what's the watch ID you need to

1278
01:27:35,230 --> 01:27:45,809
understand altogether how we can

1279
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:45,809
minimize positive effect from the calls

1280
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:55,509
we cannot close them the cloud service

1281
01:27:51,940 --> 01:28:00,910
which is used from any number is also

1282
01:27:55,510 --> 01:28:05,680
known only inbound incoming calls what

1283
01:28:00,910 --> 01:28:14,470
could be thought of near point of you

1284
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:21,790
how to deal with that switch of the

1285
01:28:14,470 --> 01:28:24,130
phone's higher pigeons you cannot solve

1286
01:28:21,790 --> 01:28:28,210
it at once no to solve it you have to

1287
01:28:24,130 --> 01:28:29,710
understand the nature of having these

1288
01:28:28,210 --> 01:28:33,730
phone calls and signals where they go

1289
01:28:29,710 --> 01:28:36,430
and why it's worse when they go from the

1290
01:28:33,730 --> 01:28:45,089
cloud service abroad it's very hard to

1291
01:28:36,430 --> 01:28:45,090
deal with them so then let me answer

1292
01:28:46,229 --> 01:28:52,440
this question we have some ideas

1293
01:28:49,909 --> 01:28:55,049
developments I will not talk much unless

1294
01:28:52,440 --> 01:29:06,329
we finalize them right now we talked

1295
01:28:55,050 --> 01:29:09,989
with a number of ministries decision

1296
01:29:06,329 --> 01:29:16,199
makers made the first step we mailed out

1297
01:29:09,989 --> 01:29:18,289
our email asking to identify incoming

1298
01:29:16,199 --> 01:29:21,629
outgoing full of numbers to block them

1299
01:29:18,289 --> 01:29:24,989
on the level of operator is going to

1300
01:29:21,630 --> 01:29:27,630
look like that we will tell you more

1301
01:29:24,989 --> 01:29:28,860
about it when we approve this technology

1302
01:29:27,630 --> 01:29:31,110
and if you finalized this technology

1303
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:32,789
actually honestly speaking understand

1304
01:29:31,110 --> 01:29:36,030
everybody's tired even have any

1305
01:29:32,789 --> 01:29:50,009
questions from the audience before I

1306
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:54,570
finalized our talk no no yes yes trend

1307
01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:57,289
is down when you spoke what Android is

1308
01:29:54,570 --> 01:30:04,579
respond Alexei I was showing this thing

1309
01:29:57,289 --> 01:30:04,579
that's a trend so given the fact that

1310
01:30:04,639 --> 01:30:12,420
southern logic Android initially was an

1311
01:30:09,209 --> 01:30:22,559
open OS and iOS was initially closed to

1312
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:26,400
us with Android thousands day layer and

1313
01:30:22,559 --> 01:30:29,729
now Android is shutting down and Google

1314
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:34,409
says their developers you've been using

1315
01:30:29,729 --> 01:30:41,760
this in these functions no more could

1316
01:30:34,409 --> 01:30:46,098
you draw full screen apps no way no more

1317
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:49,920
and what the mother do which were

1318
01:30:46,099 --> 01:30:51,839
drawing window full screen and asking

1319
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:55,409
for

1320
01:30:51,839 --> 01:31:00,119
blackmail no the trend is looking the

1321
01:30:55,409 --> 01:31:03,358
following way it was huge now and then

1322
01:31:00,119 --> 01:31:09,929

1323
01:31:03,359 --> 01:31:15,479
sinusoids and is going down here hello

1325

1327
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:37,469
interview of newcomers applicants to

1328
01:31:35,369 --> 01:31:39,739
vacancies through our company sometimes

1329
01:31:37,469 --> 01:31:43,469
we talk about security and in particular

1330
01:31:39,739 --> 01:31:47,129
there are several stories I can share a

1331
01:31:43,469 --> 01:31:51,629
few if you want in particular sir with

1332
01:31:47,129 --> 01:31:54,689
phishing site and in particular with a

1333
01:31:51,629 --> 01:31:59,608
call to a person if you're interested I

1334
01:31:54,689 --> 01:32:01,499
can say I was surprised by its level of

1335
01:31:59,609 --> 01:32:08,969
sophistication shall I continue

1336
01:32:01,499 --> 01:32:14,179
ok a person said that there was the case

1337
01:32:08,969 --> 01:32:14,179
with her mother she got a phone call

1338
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:19,699
introduced as if

1339
01:32:21,530 --> 01:32:35,190
the friend of her husband he is feeling

1340
01:32:26,010 --> 01:32:36,830
bad oh I guess his name was calling him

1341
01:32:35,190 --> 01:32:42,360
her mother

1342
01:32:36,830 --> 01:32:42,980
they knew the way they are speaking with

1343
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:53,250
her

1344
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:55,049
he said his money so she got nervous she

1345
01:32:53,250 --> 01:32:59,989
called her mother because she had just

1346
01:32:55,050 --> 01:33:03,020
heard usual way he said I cannot come

1347
01:32:59,989 --> 01:33:06,269
maybe even with the voice imitation

1348
01:33:03,020 --> 01:33:13,940
because she could not understand that's

1349
01:33:06,270 --> 01:33:13,940
wrong person he said my friend will come

1350
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:24,509
George understood she gave all the money

1351
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:28,140
like 69000 and she asked him to go to a

1352
01:33:24,510 --> 01:33:34,890
store she wanted to bring more money for

1353
01:33:28,140 --> 01:33:38,510
visiting a store the person came entered

1354
01:33:34,890 --> 01:33:43,800
into apartment got the money left and

1355
01:33:38,510 --> 01:33:47,220
that's the story I was struck by the

1356
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:50,700
awareness of the people who did the

1357
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:54,600
social engineering and the attack object

1358
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:58,200
was a non-person heart attack it was the

1359
01:33:54,600 --> 01:34:04,320
first story second story a colleague

1360
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:09,809
went to phishing sites I even have to

1361
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:14,400
buy tickets rose bourbon card she paid

1362
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:18,390
for tickets site exists it for 24 hours

1363
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:21,410
no more she paid money it's already

1364
01:34:18,390 --> 01:34:25,500
secured everything was fine

1365
01:34:21,410 --> 01:34:28,080
withdraw the money and then money gone

1366
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:29,860
no tickets went is Burbank is Burbank

1367
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:34,450
goodbye

1368
01:34:29,860 --> 01:34:38,160
is an extent same said only by requests

1369
01:34:34,450 --> 01:34:40,990
we can give you data she wrote an email

1370
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:47,920
an application so as far as I understand

1371
01:34:40,990 --> 01:34:51,519
she was told forget and forgive and they

1372
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:56,490
say no more movement so there are two

1373
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:59,170
questions along the discussion you said

1374
01:34:56,490 --> 01:35:02,519
there's a certain resource or some

1375
01:34:59,170 --> 01:35:06,520
training you had maybe you can suggest

1376
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:09,130
the source where can we send people to

1377
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:12,660
get trained to improve their awareness

1378
01:35:09,130 --> 01:35:19,530
especially old people and second point

1379
01:35:12,660 --> 01:35:25,360
in such cases when the person is hooked

1380
01:35:19,530 --> 01:35:32,280
when is gone no place to go what happens

1381
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:37,179
in the future how these people should

1382
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:40,929
react well low believe says story in

1383
01:35:37,180 --> 01:35:43,690
case well actually there are some

1384
01:35:40,930 --> 01:35:46,240
solutions to these problems or

1385
01:35:43,690 --> 01:35:48,879
situations to improve the financial

1386
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:51,179
awareness at first you don't need to go

1387
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:54,130
anywhere on the website Bank of Russia

1388
01:35:51,180 --> 01:36:00,070
in the bottom of title page you have a

1389
01:35:54,130 --> 01:36:02,650
link to site Finkel dot info this site

1390
01:36:00,070 --> 01:36:05,230
was established by the initiative of CB

1391
01:36:02,650 --> 01:36:06,759
has information about improving

1392
01:36:05,230 --> 01:36:12,009
financial awareness it has a lot of

1393
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:18,400
materials age from small from young to

1394
01:36:12,010 --> 01:36:20,380
old we always talk about improving the

1395
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:22,450
financial awareness and we give link to

1396
01:36:20,380 --> 01:36:26,710
these resources I think it's okay to

1397
01:36:22,450 --> 01:36:30,849
spend 20 30 minutes a day and watch them

1398
01:36:26,710 --> 01:36:39,480
and then here's the one is gone what to

1399
01:36:30,850 --> 01:36:39,480
do we have federal law 167

1400
01:36:39,969 --> 01:36:48,699
where we have an obligation for the

1401
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:51,340
financial organization to report about

1402
01:36:48,699 --> 01:36:52,629
it for that a client needs to go to a

1403
01:36:51,340 --> 01:36:55,480
bank and write an application that this

1404
01:36:52,630 --> 01:37:04,930
transaction was made before or without

1405
01:36:55,480 --> 01:37:19,629
his/her acknowledgement it is qualified

1406
01:37:04,930 --> 01:37:22,660
as misconduct it's related to a phrase

1407
01:37:19,630 --> 01:37:27,219
called fraudulent miss enter Miss

1408
01:37:22,660 --> 01:37:30,910
presentation misrepresentation this

1409
01:37:27,219 --> 01:37:33,160

1410
01:37:30,910 --> 01:37:36,099
bank account bank account and here we

1411
01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:40,989
have Alex Ted payment system worry about

1412
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:44,770
it same scheme with the exception of

1413
01:37:40,989 --> 01:37:49,000
some minor things in general for such

1414
01:37:44,770 --> 01:37:52,540
things if a person doesn't want to bank

1415
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:56,380
at least let him go to police and write

1416
01:37:52,540 --> 01:38:00,730
file as far as I understand the money

1417
01:37:56,380 --> 01:38:03,880
got lost nobody got found or got

1418
01:38:00,730 --> 01:38:06,809
punished I cannot comment because you

1419
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:09,120
said yourself as far as I know well

1420
01:38:06,810 --> 01:38:12,790
understand where but it's tired and the

1421
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:16,390
other question really nobody got tired

1422
01:38:12,790 --> 01:38:19,469
well hello I'll try to be quick they

1423
01:38:16,390 --> 01:38:23,860
were sort of Bank from st. Peter book

1424
01:38:19,469 --> 01:38:32,699
I'll have two questions and all of them

1425
01:38:23,860 --> 01:38:34,750
are about card for p2p any IP any thank

1426
01:38:32,699 --> 01:38:36,580
breakthrough some people saw how to

1427
01:38:34,750 --> 01:38:41,560
fight against it some people managed to

1428
01:38:36,580 --> 01:38:44,230
some people managed to fight against

1429
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:46,000
phone systems somebody couldn't do that

1430
01:38:44,230 --> 01:38:47,139
at first we had a lot of cases that we

1431
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:50,230
try to

1432
01:38:47,140 --> 01:38:53,530
sort out and at first I wanted to see

1433
01:38:50,230 --> 01:38:56,139
the support from you insert in that and

1434
01:38:53,530 --> 01:39:00,210
the established systems of incident I

1435
01:38:56,140 --> 01:39:02,680
found that you can call an address and

1436
01:39:00,210 --> 01:39:08,380
understand what's going on because the

1437
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:13,450
Fosters normally the door money in ten

1438
01:39:08,380 --> 01:39:15,400
minutes in another town so if insert

1439
01:39:13,450 --> 01:39:19,809
cannot help with anything they can

1440
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:30,070
simply give numbers to call you this

1441
01:39:19,810 --> 01:39:37,060
transfer was not banking equipment like

1442
01:39:30,070 --> 01:39:40,990
it was transferred by it is least in

1443
01:39:37,060 --> 01:39:43,150
this case they could be bank to to

1444
01:39:40,990 --> 01:39:50,320
understand to reach I mean second

1445
01:39:43,150 --> 01:39:57,849
account in our payment systems bank to

1446
01:39:50,320 --> 01:40:00,730
is not given not research information

1447
01:39:57,850 --> 01:40:02,800
this first question when could be a

1448
01:40:00,730 --> 01:40:08,740
decision between the payment systems

1449
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:11,050
about giving during processing

1450
01:40:08,740 --> 01:40:13,990
transactions of the number of the second

1451
01:40:11,050 --> 01:40:18,430
card but the transfer was gone we

1452
01:40:13,990 --> 01:40:25,240
discussed about it with operators in

1453
01:40:18,430 --> 01:40:27,660
fact it's quite an uneasy step it is

1454
01:40:25,240 --> 01:40:27,660
discussed

1455
01:40:28,469 --> 01:40:35,750
upon us that the if you are using

1456
01:40:31,770 --> 01:40:40,020
phishing site to make car to Cart right

1457
01:40:35,750 --> 01:40:50,130
now not fishing it's it's legitimate it

1458
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:53,010
could be the transfer let me tell you in

1459
01:40:50,130 --> 01:40:55,680
details I will not tell you from stage

1460
01:40:53,010 --> 01:40:58,370
and it will take a lot of time we have

1461
01:40:55,680 --> 01:41:01,770
people who can make deep explanation

1462
01:40:58,370 --> 01:41:05,309
after the finish I introduce you to him

1463
01:41:01,770 --> 01:41:08,160
and you'll talk in details what is the

1464
01:41:05,310 --> 01:41:14,280
point we know about such situations of

1465
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:18,269
course we cannot give some commands to

1466
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:21,150
payment systems my obvious reasons the

1467
01:41:18,270 --> 01:41:23,210
technology is run established and there

1468
01:41:21,150 --> 01:41:27,929
are some documents in addition to that

1469
01:41:23,210 --> 01:41:35,969
to break everything makes no sense first

1470
01:41:27,930 --> 01:41:42,030
of all on one hand from users they need

1471
01:41:35,969 --> 01:41:46,219
to understand that they must become more

1472
01:41:42,030 --> 01:41:51,509
aware and littered on the other hand

1473
01:41:46,219 --> 01:41:55,380
when let's cooperate because we know

1474
01:41:51,510 --> 01:42:00,360
something and we can do things can I

1475
01:41:55,380 --> 01:42:08,760
answer no listen everybody start just

1476
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:11,519
one sec I want to let everybody go let's

1477
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:15,770
do this let's sum up what we've

1478
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:21,239
understood we understood that we are not

1479
01:42:15,770 --> 01:42:24,600
ahead of others in terms of security but

1480
01:42:21,239 --> 01:42:27,120
still do we have a lot of things to do

1481
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:29,640
we have mobile devices we need to do

1482
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:33,630
something about other platforms as a

1483
01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:35,910
protector damn I don't know initiate

1484
01:42:33,630 --> 01:42:38,970
just developing a new platform simple

1485
01:42:35,910 --> 01:42:44,340
trends we have to teach our users with

1486
01:42:38,970 --> 01:42:48,980
the financial services train them as a

1487
01:42:44,340 --> 01:42:48,980
fin sack as the organization which has a

1488
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:58,230
duty and physical relations with clients

1489
01:42:52,400 --> 01:43:03,509
our developers and vendors know how to

1490
01:42:58,230 --> 01:43:06,120
minimize risks using the malware may be

1491
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:09,510
issuing applications for mobile devices

1492
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:12,599
for the platforms and others there's a

1493
01:43:09,510 --> 01:43:16,800
comprehensive problem and we need to

1494
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:19,820
have a comprehensive approach we have

1495
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:24,150
not just banks options that we have

1496
01:43:19,820 --> 01:43:27,599
insurance companies we have anti-virus

1497
01:43:24,150 --> 01:43:29,759
labs we have developers of software any

1498
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:32,640
software including the banking software

1499
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:36,830
and through that we reduce time of

1500
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:46,200
response to an idea of creating any

1501
01:43:36,830 --> 01:43:49,760
meaning device or security because when

1502
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:52,590
we mail out our security bulletins

1503
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:56,820
everybody understand what we are talking

1504
01:43:52,590 --> 01:44:02,760
about and it reduces time and this is a

1505
01:43:56,820 --> 01:44:05,250
trend and in the future we will try to

1506
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:09,600
minimize the time of your suppose that

1507
01:44:05,250 --> 01:44:13,560
we need and please correct me if I'm

1508
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:16,500
wrong what we what we see from what was

1509
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:20,730
before and what is now in a number of

1510
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:28,370
cases we see old tools with old

1511
01:44:20,730 --> 01:44:31,230
producers in vendors our hackers also

1512
01:44:28,370 --> 01:44:35,130
pass through evolution and we see the

1513
01:44:31,230 --> 01:44:38,839
targeted attack recently it becomes not

1514
01:44:35,130 --> 01:44:38,840
an effective way

1515
01:44:39,409 --> 01:44:46,848
but they use fishing more and more what

1516
01:44:43,949 --> 01:44:49,049
does it mean it's hard for me to sing

1517
01:44:46,849 --> 01:44:53,550
immediately but understand that we are

1518
01:44:49,050 --> 01:44:58,019
in right way when I accept there's a big

1519
01:44:53,550 --> 01:45:03,599
chance that we have a silence before the

1520
01:44:58,019 --> 01:45:08,489
storm last year we serve as desert trend

1521
01:45:03,599 --> 01:45:11,280
but maybe we are about to see a new

1522
01:45:08,489 --> 01:45:15,148
trend so with that I'd like to thank the

1523
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:17,789
speakers thanking usual for holding up

1524
01:45:15,149 --> 01:45:21,149
this feed of our discussion we should

1525
01:45:17,789 --> 01:45:23,268
lock and save your money good luck thank

1526
01:45:21,149 --> 01:45:23,269
you
