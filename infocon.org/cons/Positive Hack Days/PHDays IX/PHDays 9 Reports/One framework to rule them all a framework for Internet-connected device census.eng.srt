1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:08,010
hello my name is Anton I like to talk

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:12,030
about my free world that I do it's

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:14,009
designed to simplify the search for

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,948
although that you're short and senses

5
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:19,289
senses false mind and the so true to

6
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:23,010
make their lives easier for yourself

7
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:26,189
there's an edge and some so the mean so

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:29,640
the main searching problems so there are

9
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:32,009
some problems that we all face when we

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,829
try to find it something that you want

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:37,770
in the system vendor product so we

12
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,750
cannot just do only one query so there's

13
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,270
no such query that's why we need to

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,210
combine a lot of different requests

15
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:49,440
results identify different queries homes

16
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:52,559
things and then to our certain C and how

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,589
to find vulnerable finds on their

18
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,459
abilities and active services unfounded

19
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:01,770
host so we need to apply some host

20
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:05,610
additions etc and so we need to see

21
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,680
certain analytics or what we have

22
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,780
collected what we have assembled and see

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,580
how it works um and even didn't have

24
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,950
this very work if it were not automated

25
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:17,039
it would be more about will be pain and

26
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:20,040
suffering that is why we have to do it

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,040
by hand we have to assemble it process

28
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,890
it and every time when I think about it

29
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,009
I see this Vietnam flashbacks I don't

30
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,979
want to do it and then that's why don't

31
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:34,799
be automated all so that I could just

32
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:37,860
press one button and can do it quickly

33
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,310
by myself yeah without without my

34
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:44,460
interference and I would the way to fit

35
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:47,040
our own development that I'm trying to

36
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,298
develop this grinder framework to

37
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,579
resolve all this problem is that

38
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,530
automatically just one touch so you

39
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,658
enter the command and you get all the

40
00:01:52,530 --> 00:02:05,909
results quickly in

41
00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:08,729
in one in one readable form and that and

42
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:12,269
so then so then one framework to rule

43
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:15,810
them all and so then they the Ring of

44
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:19,459
Power as a super Universal wrapper that

45
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:24,290
would do it all by itself and what

46
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:28,500
Grindr is all about what is it made of

47
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:30,569
so the main back-end we're looking for

48
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,989
all the gadgets were called shortened

49
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:36,420
census show the census of the databases

50
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:41,430
of the other gadgets they were look what

51
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:44,220
we need then we use rollers owners as

52
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:46,470
the main module for active scanning or

53
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:49,560
vulnerabilities on which hosts we found

54
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:51,329
them and then we tend and we take the

55
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,000
vulnerabilities from shortened database

56
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:55,620
which identify some vulnerable to serve

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,680
the combined picture from different

58
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,989
sources and and then identify the

59
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,200
services and ports what's active was not

60
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:07,440
active we use map and in map and the to

61
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:10,589
in map we have the automatic Aloha Aloha

62
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,500
and so that we can do the customer

63
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:16,230
scripts at the unmapped level and we can

64
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,510
write scripts like Laurel Python so the

65
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,760
framework supports additional scanning

66
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:23,010
with the help of different scripts so

67
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,828
quite a lot and then all this

68
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:28,980
information is built together in some

69
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:32,489
resulting files sweet 16 and database

70
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:34,018
and then all this we use reuse and so

71
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:36,450
then can be put to use in your own

72
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:39,060
projects or import it as a separate

73
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,339
module and if you do something you can

74
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,370
take the grinder take some modules

75
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:47,470
functions import them imported and and

76
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:50,420
work with this functionality

77
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:52,630
it's quite straightforward so that's a

78
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:55,519
console set of parameters

79
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:59,240
so when we'll do the scanning the

80
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,550
assembling data what we want to get and

81
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,040
so then it does the scanning but they

82
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:06,170
have an map and the warners customer

83
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,450
scripts they do the scanning with the

84
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:10,760
help of this things and that's what it

85
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:14,149
looks like and then the main features

86
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:18,289
features that we have already listed

87
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:21,168
them all and they so then it's not a

88
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:26,480
final sale is because I'm working on

89
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:29,479
other I developed more things as I began

90
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:32,060
so we want to add for foods of my and

91
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:36,020
other services I want to add to this but

92
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:38,210
there so the work goes on so workflow

93
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:42,320
hasn't happened so we have a certain

94
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:45,200
query list and they will talk about

95
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,570
large scanning for a large project so

96
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,719
that one queer is not enough and so then

97
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:53,840
in the in event of of different searches

98
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,030
sometimes we're going to go up to 500 at

99
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,340
the one hundred hundred queries to

100
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:01,520
shorten and so when it automated time

101
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,950
two hundred and then we do the list of

102
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,680
the queer is the different system

103
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:09,919
shortener and otherwise then we put them

104
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:12,050
into a file in JSON and then and then we

105
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,210
do the passive scanning as with the help

106
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:17,180
of shortened census and others so we get

107
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:19,669
old information will need so then we get

108
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,950
the hosts they're sorted by products

109
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:24,650
vendors and other characteristics

110
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:26,719
something that can be input and then I

111
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:29,840
have having collected all the holes we

112
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,050
do the active scanning we use a map and

113
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,419
volume owners to find versions and other

114
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:37,400
and other scripts services and

115
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:40,010
vulnerabilities when they finish active

116
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,950
scanning so we run it with the help of

117
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:45,469
and map have owners etcetera what's

118
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:48,680
actually was not active and then host my

119
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:50,030
host we do we transfer it to customer

120
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,610
scripts you can get all the information

121
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:56,070
about the specific host whatever other

122
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:58,050
ability and actives services and ports

123
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,760
in our script without the additional

124
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,280
checks and we got all the information

125
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,020
about their host and then we can do what

126
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,369
I want with this information to the

127
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:10,620
report and process it etc and with the

128
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,690
help of return to return all the

129
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,850
information from the host Intel database

130
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:17,040
and get the general picture the big

131
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:19,500
picture and then eventually all this

132
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:24,210
information is generated in the form of

133
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:26,580
reports and also charts tables are also

134
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:28,530
interactive map is there and there's

135
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,880
where all these gadgets are there and so

136
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:32,909
there's additional information is that

137
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:36,630
it and an individual then the resulting

138
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:39,300
files so then you can use you can parse

139
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:43,110
it the way you want for follow-up

140
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:46,230
research if knit with needle and this is

141
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:49,170
it so this is it's all about in the main

142
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:53,100
grinder and some examples where the

143
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:55,350
framework has been applied and and what

144
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:59,280
the campus became the therefore father

145
00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:04,530
saw this framework and I'll start with

146
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:07,760
SD when new hope it's a new project then

147
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:12,270
that are involved in as the one research

148
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:18,060
so they started studying this situation

149
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:21,150
analysis of the gadgets was done so then

150
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:23,520
we can infer mission and I guess huh we

151
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:25,739
can't get more information from github

152
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,200
what I do the analysis the customer

153
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:31,110
scriptures what I'm doing and then I

154
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:33,240
process the data and I'm not game just

155
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:36,620
to talk more about that I'll show some

156
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:41,250
results my colleague spoke about that

157
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:44,730
so they said SD when mapped more than

158
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:48,420
8,000 holes and in order to perform this

159
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:52,610
search and find all those gadgets we use

160
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:55,500
more than 50 50 50 queries to show them

161
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:59,250
because we need to select unique host

162
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:03,100
and and so to make sure that information

163
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:04,720
is up and running and as it is now

164
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:08,320
and there so that there is the grinder

165
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:11,560
and so that would do it much faster now

166
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:14,740
and it's a matter a few minutes if you

167
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:17,140
scan the entire so they notice if you're

168
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:20,620
parody and all these gadgets that's what

169
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:23,469
it looks like and so then we do the

170
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:26,320
charts pies byproducts once we have

171
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:28,560
found sorted and then we have some some

172
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:32,020
charts with vendors found products found

173
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:35,049
reports etc lots of lots of stuff many

174
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:37,689
many substances that the basis of which

175
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:44,079
were we build the spice continents

176
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:49,480
countries etc now to another case

177
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:52,000
medicine is there is there is there are

178
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:56,020
where everything is so sensitive and

179
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,890
very difficult and there is why in

180
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:03,010
medicine we can say that in medicine

181
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:05,560
like in any other here like medicine so

182
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:09,010
there are specific protocols approaches

183
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:11,469
methods are transfer information and for

184
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:12,880
medicine will talk about daikon DICOM as

185
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:14,740
a standard their common is not the

186
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,950
protocol assistant that come as a

187
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:20,950
standard of transfers of storing or

188
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:24,040
images from different gadgets so

189
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:27,070
ultrasound MRI etcetera and then it and

190
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:29,410
the protocol transfer of of images in

191
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:32,860
the network for example the United

192
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:33,430
States so that images are not given just

193
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,770
by hand

194
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:38,680
so from doctor to doctors inside the

195
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:41,410
network or several hospitals so

196
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:45,370
according to DICOM protocol that

197
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:48,310
everything will be fine but it's not not

198
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:52,660
everything is fine and the so we can see

199
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:54,849
those servers so if you if you look

200
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:58,089
documentation from the observer and you

201
00:09:54,850 --> 00:10:03,070
can see the solutions in the majority of

202
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:06,490
cases they're using a port 104 and for

203
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:10,270
that conserver but you cannot use it 104

204
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:12,050
port and it means that is daikon now

205
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:15,649
when it just to be confident that

206
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:18,800
1:04 is that company and I call a server

207
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:21,019
response and then information that comes

208
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,429
from that calm server that tells us this

209
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:26,809
is DICOM and then we can work with it

210
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:32,569
okay then we'll find that comms

211
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:36,949
I saw sigh servers more than 1700 so

212
00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:44,389
then they come port 104 and then we

213
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:47,059
should not forget that they come and

214
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:53,329
it's obvious that summation about

215
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:55,549
patience there as well II talk and yes

216
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:58,819
when we understand it we can look

217
00:10:55,549 --> 00:11:01,309
probably there are some viewers link to

218
00:10:58,819 --> 00:11:04,069
those observers or explorers or at least

219
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:10,999
file storage of course as they do exist

220
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:13,849
them as a one example this is a very

221
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:15,949
convenient I think information about the

222
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:18,110
patient that parses the images and

223
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:22,008
research and breaks into series and

224
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:25,970
patients names of birthdate if we find

225
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:27,980
an open browser for DICOM solutions we

226
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:33,309
find virtually all information about

227
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:33,309
this hospital we find patients we find

228
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:46,399
and look at the patient's the images

229
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:49,129
about the patient password so you can

230
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,529
just open the solution and see and what

231
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:53,869
else we can get a standard comma for the

232
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:56,449
specific patient and so looks like that

233
00:11:53,869 --> 00:11:58,220
it's the smallest part at the minimum we

234
00:11:56,449 --> 00:12:02,179
can get we can see at least the name

235
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:06,829
birth date gender age and any other

236
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:09,709
information and we can get his tests and

237
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:11,540
medical data we can see everything we

238
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:13,989
can see the world of a person no matter

239
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:17,709
how pathetic it sounds

240
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:20,920
and then there are some chart huh it's

241
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:27,490
located by countries and it's America

242
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:30,520
and it's Asia and again there are some

243
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:33,010
vulnerabilities linked to web interfaces

244
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,670
to viewers to Explorer so that I

245
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:38,410
mentioned and still it's interesting

246
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:43,750
vulnerabilities such as canned through a

247
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:46,120
short run together and yes from big to

248
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:50,260
small Devils in detail I don't we look

249
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,490
at the controller door controller some

250
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,280
door controllers that would be

251
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:56,410
controlled through networks you can

252
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,880
remotely control them open close to

253
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:02,890
something else there's nothing new

254
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:05,590
except that sometimes these solutions

255
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:08,920
are not always good very good or very

256
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:12,100
safe very secure and every year even

257
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:14,770
more often we can see that permanently

258
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,920
some vulnerabilities emerge and problems

259
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:20,800
with doors and some other smart devices

260
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:23,110
that are in charge on physical access to

261
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,290
segments and speaking about forces

262
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:28,180
vertex is a controller door controller

263
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:33,310
from heat company very popular over

264
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:35,859
season and if you don't really look for

265
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:39,040
it but use only one query for their port

266
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:44,710
for their name average stress controller

267
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:49,209
with the protocol we can find

268
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:53,470
immediately over 100 over 100 host and

269
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:56,380
see where they are and mainly in the

270
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,940
u.s. up to the location and the building

271
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,400
and they which part of the building

272
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:02,910
they're in and then you can do whatever

273
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,910
you wish

274
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:11,498
and then web cameras it's a favourite

275
00:14:08,619 --> 00:14:14,439
topic for all those who use a short

276
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:16,899
month a debt because the web cameras

277
00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:20,009
very often are open and they are

278
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:24,100
available to everyone nobody cares about

279
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:27,040
their security you know they did that

280
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:32,589
they need at least a B pastor password

281
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:34,049
you know that's the situation and this

282
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:37,179
is a simple case

283
00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:39,850
now they a matter is adjust how much

284
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:41,829
time you can devote to those cameras and

285
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:45,519
how carefully you're going to it and so

286
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:48,638
I tried them I did my best to work with

287
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:51,459
the cameras and speaking about webcam

288
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:54,699
Yocum or Cisco in Cisco cameras web

289
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:57,128
cameras so very often there is simply

290
00:14:54,699 --> 00:14:59,378
too fast simple to find easy to find and

291
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:02,109
they are not protected no password you

292
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:03,939
just go to the link and you see the

293
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:09,220
string from the camera they'll destroy

294
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:13,389
and there are so many of them

295
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:17,100
I didn't write how many but I think that

296
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:20,499
finally we found the over fifty five

297
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:23,019
thousand cameras and this is a simple

298
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:25,949
basic waste they're all functional I

299
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:29,139
wanted to try the devices that indeed

300
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:32,019
you come and see you come and watch we

301
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:33,939
don't need to open or enter something so

302
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:38,379
they are just directly open into the

303
00:15:33,939 --> 00:15:43,779
world that's this case and if we speak

304
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:48,759
about other things we can look for other

305
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:51,939
things maybe some strange headers job

306
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:54,009
invitations job searches they all look

307
00:15:51,939 --> 00:15:56,649
different but if you use your

308
00:15:54,009 --> 00:16:00,009
imagination you can easily find them and

309
00:15:56,649 --> 00:16:02,679
you cannot see but in every message you

310
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:05,709
have a special email with ID so that you

311
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:08,529
could use it and say yes in this

312
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:10,599
response I found this message and say so

313
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:13,410
an interesting saying you can try and

314
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:20,399
search that's cool

315
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:24,358
I guess that's it but you know there are

316
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:26,759
so many cases and again it's only you

317
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:28,589
know the limit is your imagination use

318
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:35,009
your imagination it will be great and

319
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:39,049
interesting now your questions that's a

320
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:39,049
link to this framework and my telegram

321
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:58,870
hi thank you for the presentation how

322
00:16:55,810 --> 00:17:01,180
did you upload the fronton if you wanted

323
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:03,540
to upload big volume so probably it will

324
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:06,099
be unsuccessful and take much time for

325
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:08,970
what what's the big volume over ten

326
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:12,250
thousand I uploaded half a million and

327
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:15,669
it didn't go well great perfect good

328
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:17,559
data yep then you were lucky yes I don't

329
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:20,470
know maybe there are some problems at

330
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:27,609
least I didn't encounter them and they

331
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:29,950
in my solutions I tried to optimize it

332
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:34,330
means that you wait for the upload and

333
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:40,540
then yes the main idea I use it a for

334
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:42,370
the pointed sampling I don't like to

335
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:44,168
upload results from one query because

336
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:46,389
they will not be accurate maybe half

337
00:17:44,169 --> 00:17:49,750
will not be accurate so I I believe you

338
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:53,919
need to download and small bitches but

339
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:56,320
very accurately so it will just if it

340
00:17:53,919 --> 00:18:00,100
has many queries it will just process

341
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,639
and it happens if it takes it's very

342
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,129
quick

343
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:10,990
we had many queries but they were you

344
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:12,850
know going and very quickly if there is

345
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:16,980
a problem I'll be happy to listen to you

346
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,980
no problem get in touch with me
