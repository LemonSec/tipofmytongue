1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,850
good afternoon everyone we are so glad

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:09,139
to have this opportunity to share our

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:14,490
research who is you and this research

4
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:18,600
when name is coaster no version too

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:23,390
it is about convert a ble command and

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:26,849
control channel to bypass air gaming

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:33,840
first self introduction my name is Mark

8
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:34,700
and my colleague wrong and we come from

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,719
China

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:42,649
Shifu 360 and she said she who 360 is

11
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,649
lady

12
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:52,769
like McAfee or SEMATECH our core

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:57,199
products antivirus security software for

14
00:00:52,769 --> 00:01:02,339
computers and cell phones and our team

15
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:07,490
Pixar's team was founded in 2015 it is a

16
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:12,539
red team from 360 security technology

17
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:17,009
focusing awareness IOT security and we

18
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:19,830
created a 360 is cast can wear this

19
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:24,420
intrusion and Prevention say Sarah and

20
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:30,780
we have achieved a 100 success rate in

21
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:33,720
our wellies penetration test ok here is

22
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,240
the agenda we will first give you an

23
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:41,009
introduction about air-gapped Network

24
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:43,908
and the related art Ike Evans then we

25
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:48,569
will introduce some previous research

26
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:52,319
aircraft attack of the site we will

27
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:55,800
review the previous go sterno version 1

28
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:58,709
and after that we will introduce what is

29
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,470
the ghost an aversion to and how to

30
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:04,879
implement it

31
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:08,959
finally we will show you a simple demo

32
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:12,870
ok let me show you what is air gabbing

33
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:17,040
okay according to Wikipedia air gap is a

34
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:19,370
network security naira employment one or

35
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,040
more computers to ensure light a

36
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:26,810
security compute network is a physically

37
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:31,549
isolated heater from unsecure networks

38
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:36,330
such the public internet or unsecured

39
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:39,599
local area network soon the name arises

40
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:42,120
from the technique of creating a network

41
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:46,018
that is physically separated from other

42
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:49,440
networks and it aims to avoid the

43
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:54,450
intrusion and the data leakage through

44
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,859
network connections most of the time

45
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:59,459
air-gapped Network

46
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:02,880
I consider the most secure networks as

47
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:05,040
we all know hikers are exploiting

48
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,840
vulnerabilities is their operating

49
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:12,299
system application software or

50
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:16,950
communication protocols and attacking

51
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:21,570
via the Internet however those does not

52
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:23,790
apply to air gapped Network holidays how

53
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:27,440
do you remotely like a computer that

54
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:32,459
isn't even not connected to the network

55
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:35,750
yes area system were believed to be more

56
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:39,989
security in the past since the required

57
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:43,800
physical access to touch them but from

58
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:46,950
an attackers perspective nothing is

59
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:52,350
impossible they can break through the

60
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:56,519
air gapped Network where an infected USB

61
00:03:52,350 --> 00:04:01,940
flash drive USB device oh I employees

62
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:04,890
laptop one of the most famous cases

63
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:09,140
involving the affection of air-gapped

64
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:13,640
system is the stucks night - tonight is

65
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:18,510
malicious computer warm first Ankara in

66
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:23,330
2010 sorry to help people development

67
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:27,780
here since at least 2005 stuck snide

68
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:30,900
targets scanner system and is believed

69
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:33,419
to be responsible for causing the

70
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:37,260
substantial damage to Iran's nuclear

71
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:41,609
program and the stocks night has three

72
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:44,280
modules a warm that excuse our routing

73
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:49,100
related to the main hello des of the

74
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:53,340
attack and a link file that atomically

75
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:56,820
excuse the worm and adjudicator

76
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:59,429
component responsible hiding all

77
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:02,790
malicious files and the processes and

78
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:06,510
preventing detection of the presence of

79
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:08,950
stocks night it is typically introduced

80
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:12,789
to the targeting environment

81
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:18,330
we are effected a USB flash drive there

82
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:21,970
by crossing any air gap the room then

83
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:25,650
propagates across the network as and the

84
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:29,620
scanning for siemens step7 software on

85
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:32,229
computer and controlling our PLC you

86
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:36,550
know since all four other criterion

87
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:39,550
stuck snide become dormant instead of

88
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:40,960
the computer if both conditions are

89
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:45,540
fulfilled

90
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:50,169
Stuxnet introduced the affected judicata

91
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:53,250
onto the PLC and the step7 software and

92
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:56,410
modifying the current the code and

93
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:59,260
gaming an expected command to the PRC

94
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:01,630
we're returning a look of normal

95
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:07,599
operating system ovalle was the feedback

96
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:11,370
to the users and according to an IC

97
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:15,370
document leaked in 2013

98
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:18,580
cottonmouths version 1 is a USB hundred

99
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:21,940
hardware implant which will provide a

100
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:26,320
wireless bridge into air-gapped target

101
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:30,820
network as well as the ability to load

102
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:33,940
the explora software onto the target it

103
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:37,270
comes with a penny in body the

104
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:41,230
transceiver and the spy agency can

105
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:45,219
extract and transmit data to a briefcase

106
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:51,010
the size and s a relay station and up to

107
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:53,860
8 miles away where our signals the

108
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:56,890
recent years the security researchers

109
00:06:53,860 --> 00:07:00,610
have also began to focus our gaps

110
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:06,490
attacks so let's take a look at some of

111
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:10,810
the previous research in 2014

112
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:14,740
researchers at zebra security lives at

113
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:18,310
ben-gurion university in israel and the

114
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:21,120
health fund to spoon a personal computer

115
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:24,930
even with no net worth

116
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:27,420
the technology was using by FM radio

117
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:30,390
receiver in Claudia years some of the

118
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:33,810
mobile phones it is able to capture

119
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:36,539
keystrokes by interested in certain

120
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:39,950
radio emissions from the monitor or

121
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:44,010
display unit of the isolated computer

122
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:47,900
the researchers can take after the FM's

123
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:50,909
thinking it was nearby smart phone and

124
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:56,609
translated FM signals into the typed

125
00:07:50,910 --> 00:08:00,270
text it is also the Israeli researchers

126
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:06,390
at cybersecurity lives from ben-gurion

127
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:10,590
University in 2015 have found new

128
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:14,789
techniques to hike UTRA secure aircraft

129
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:16,950
computers and refuel data only heat

130
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:23,580
emissions and a computer beauty in

131
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:27,210
thermal sensor and the last year the

132
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:30,659
zebra axe researchers and at by hat

133
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:34,650
Europe explain how to use filter the

134
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:39,510
data via RF signal by attacking Siemens

135
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:44,360
PLC the injector a letter logic code

136
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:48,390
into the siemens s7 - PLC thus the CUDA

137
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:50,760
using the memory copy operations to

138
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:53,810
generate a frequency modulated RF

139
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,610
signals and a slightly pillows a.m. band

140
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:59,280
with the modulation representing the

141
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:02,640
encoded code and the thing that will

142
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:06,839
then be picked up by a nearby aunt Anna

143
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:14,069
and that I coded using a low-cost SDR

144
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:17,910
and a PC so according to the previous

145
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:20,850
events and research we can see attacking

146
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:25,560
an air-gapped Network general takes the

147
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:28,980
two steps the first is we implant

148
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:32,270
Mario or hardware to the target assessor

149
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:35,090
and the second type is to establish

150
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:40,069
a communication channel to execute

151
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:43,640
commands and is filled with data okay

152
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:47,810
our previous research the kernel version

153
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:52,340
1 is a Wi-Fi card channel and it can

154
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:56,959
bypass air gap in the coastal version

155
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:59,990
one use the USB HID to release the

156
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:03,440
payload into the target system like your

157
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:05,840
Windows laptop then the pillow they used

158
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,450
the building where is natural kada of

159
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:11,750
the target you wants to establish a

160
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:14,170
command and control channel with another

161
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:18,830
computer controlled by an attacker

162
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:22,189
costano version 1 use a special SSID as

163
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:25,640
an identifier and establish the control

164
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:29,450
channel we are custom protocol based on

165
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:31,520
Wi-Fi beacon frame and the proper

166
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:35,510
request frame and the proper response

167
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:37,850
frame and this custom protocol does not

168
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:43,060
affect the victims normal network

169
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:43,060
connection so you will never see it

170
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:50,750
the conversion tool is a Bluetooth

171
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:54,380
convert Channel and this also can bypass

172
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:58,040
the air gapping and the ghost an

173
00:10:54,380 --> 00:11:01,310
aversion to can be also used as a USB

174
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:04,660
HID to release the payload into the

175
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:09,109
target system like Mike OS or Windows

176
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:12,079
laptop the payload uses the built-in

177
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:14,390
Bluetooth adapter of the target device

178
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:19,300
to achieve the control channel with

179
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:22,430
another computer coaster no version to

180
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:25,870
establish the control channel we are

181
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:30,349
arms whereas the Bluetooth Low Energy

182
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:33,440
protocol that is a cousin protocol does

183
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:37,820
not affect the victim's normal Bluetooth

184
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:40,460
connection so the attacker can currently

185
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:44,900
pass the commands to the target system

186
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:46,110
and exfiltrate data and the victim will

187
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:51,990
not be able to

188
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:54,930
any abnormal the conversion to does not

189
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:59,240
require a normal network connections so

190
00:11:54,930 --> 00:12:02,130
it can bypass firewalls and has no

191
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:05,550
interference with the target existing

192
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:09,120
connections and it is support across

193
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:12,750
platforms it can be used to attack any

194
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:16,410
device with Bluetooth adapter and we

195
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:18,750
tested her with acid attack on Windows

196
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:22,290
10 and it worked

197
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:27,120
waiting about 50 meters and a human

198
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:30,599
father we know Bluetooth is a technology

199
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,720
for where is the local area networking

200
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,899
with device devices use the usual

201
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:40,260
Bluetooth connection a commodity ones

202
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:43,620
must first establish a connection with

203
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,790
the master device like this through

204
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:49,500
scanning

205
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:52,500
Parry and the connection processing if

206
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:56,730
you take a look at the Bluetooth setup a

207
00:12:52,500 --> 00:13:01,699
page you will find the car in the

208
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:05,519
crackit connection us is your computer

209
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:08,010
but go sternal version to does not

210
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:11,730
follow the euro bluetooth connections

211
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:15,060
the procedure that is we do not help you

212
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:18,690
go through the pairing connecting and

213
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:20,790
all that kind of stuff it only used the

214
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:26,880
Bluetooth Low Energy that what has a

215
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:29,730
data frame to communicate okay here is

216
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:34,459
the thing about the bluetooth low energy

217
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:37,980
state and there are four states and

218
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:41,369
three frame classes that are specify the

219
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:44,550
type of freedom can be transferred by a

220
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:49,880
device in each state and the second

221
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:53,069
state is discovery the discovery state

222
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,900
could exchange data with other adding

223
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,690
connections

224
00:13:53,900 --> 00:14:03,160
and the otherwise otherwise magnetic

225
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:07,790
data it can be transferred here are some

226
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:10,160
taps of Bluetooth low-energy frame the

227
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:13,990
discovery frame and as a connection

228
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:17,569
frame and the data frame as we can see

229
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:21,410
advertising and the scanning pilla

230
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:23,990
belonging to the discovery frame so we

231
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:28,130
could trance transmitted data by the web

232
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:34,160
passing data or scan request and the

233
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:37,010
skin response the discovery state could

234
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:41,780
walk at passing with scanning mode or

235
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:45,920
actual scanning order we impress it with

236
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:49,699
scanning mode the link layer will only

237
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:54,740
receive about husband data and initial

238
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:57,940
never send out any packets and in active

239
00:14:54,740 --> 00:15:01,430
scanning mode the link layer shall

240
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:04,490
listen for other work has in pillows and

241
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:08,120
depending on other what has in pillows

242
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:11,480
type it may request an advertiser to

243
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:14,030
send additional information after

244
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,820
interning the scanning state if the link

245
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:18,319
layer receives a scannable payload from

246
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:21,370
Edward advertiser

247
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:24,980
allowed by the scanner filter policy

248
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:28,460
initial respond with scan requests

249
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:35,060
payload and is then listen for the skin

250
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:39,580
response payload okay let's see how

251
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:42,920
kernel version 2 is implemented

252
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:46,910
according to the Bluetooth specification

253
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:51,229
version 4.2 the Bluetooth low-energy

254
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:53,600
link layer has only one packet format

255
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:58,510
used to focus on what has in general

256
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,510
package and data channel pockets

257
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:07,270
this is paralyzing channel data for

258
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:10,580
might the payload consists of

259
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:13,610
advertising address and other what has

260
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:16,370
been a data structure and what has been

261
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:18,740
the date advice is the at what hazards

262
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:23,450
that you want my advice

263
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:27,800
it has a sixth bias and advising channel

264
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:31,220
pillows serves only to Paris broadcast

265
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:35,120
data for applications and to know the

266
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:39,230
require a Foley connection or discovery

267
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:42,470
sleigh was Anacin connected resume we

268
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:48,080
will use that has metadata structure to

269
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:51,290
send it a custom data and this is the

270
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:53,000
other word has been a data structure we

271
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:55,040
could cause from the word husband

272
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,270
infrastructure to identify the target

273
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:01,579
the device a number of the word husband

274
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:05,900
it has structure having the falling

275
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:08,540
format and one biased data lines better

276
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:14,330
enclose the type field and the data

277
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:23,599
field and one one byte datatype and up

278
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:27,159
to twenty nine bias ad data okay not a

279
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:31,310
problem is how to send and receive

280
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:35,540
Bluetooth Low Energy frame through local

281
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:38,889
Bluetooth interface in userspace as we

282
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:42,980
know the Bluetooth shall has two most

283
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:46,780
the Bluetooth basic rate all the he has

284
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:52,010
data rate it is also called a PR or EDR

285
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:54,879
is a typically used for very huge orange

286
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:58,850
continuous various connections such as

287
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:01,720
streaming audio to hazards and is a

288
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:05,870
Bluetooth Low Energy and also called

289
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:08,450
prae is designed to use short bursts of

290
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:12,409
longer range radio connections make it

291
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:15,890
are you for Internet all the things

292
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:19,430
and they do not require the continuous

293
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:22,430
connection these apps they can often run

294
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:23,990
on just the wine corn style and the

295
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:28,700
steelhead were directly with long

296
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:32,660
battery life and luckily most of the

297
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:38,650
worldís module in PC has a double mode

298
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:43,130
awareness Bluetooth and the Wi-Fi combo

299
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:45,350
as it could work independently so you in

300
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:48,280
your Bluetooth highside connects with

301
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:51,469
your PC and you are listening the music

302
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:54,860
the beer he could still working as

303
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:57,080
another purpose for some connecting to

304
00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:01,340
your band

305
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:07,399
at last we must find the read API to

306
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:10,070
send our payload okay let's take a look

307
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:14,450
at how to send and receive Bluetooth

308
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:17,419
frame in Windows we could use what

309
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:21,080
husband what has meant a tinnitus and

310
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:23,780
our custom payload we need one at what

311
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:26,899
husband in a structure to identify who

312
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:32,660
we are and followed with our custom the

313
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:35,660
payload so I didn't Fifield 0xff for is

314
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:39,140
the manufacturer specific what husband

315
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:41,900
in a structure company Andy field and

316
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:44,990
the data field could be any unique

317
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:51,860
number to distinguish our payload from

318
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:54,920
others ok here is Cody in Windows to

319
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:58,840
sender the custom payload and we could

320
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:02,870
create C Java console project on Windows

321
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:07,730
as we can see the manufacturer data is

322
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:10,189
used to identify our pillows the payload

323
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:13,730
the data section is used to send the

324
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:17,210
costume payload and once the publisher

325
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:21,340
stud heater the Pierrot module will send

326
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:21,340
the payload out automatically

327
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:28,730
and here is a code in Windows who

328
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:32,630
received the constant payload and we

329
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:36,710
couldn't subscribe our pillows by the

330
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:38,570
manufacturer data in the previous when

331
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:41,450
the manufacturer field a match to the

332
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:43,550
car in the payload the function at the

333
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:46,370
word husband Ricci would've will be

334
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:53,060
called that we can handle the cost from

335
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:57,620
data is that a function okay here's the

336
00:20:53,060 --> 00:21:01,790
coaster no rushing to is BAE both client

337
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:06,520
and server could work as a scanner or

338
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:10,790
advertiser and use that what husband

339
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:13,280
scan request or scan response free to

340
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:23,350
exchange data directly without any

341
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:23,350
connections okay let's see simple demo

342
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:33,260
the PC on the life that is the victim

343
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:35,660
and we could see the PCs insight and the

344
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:42,980
Bluetooth are this connector so it is

345
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:46,750
not connected to the Internet the laptop

346
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:46,750
otherwise is the attacker

347
00:21:51,380 --> 00:22:03,900
and we could send and receive data

348
00:21:54,299 --> 00:22:06,840
through the costano version to this is

349
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:09,110
the system information of the victims

350
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,110
computer

351
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:49,439
okay that's my cousin aversion to

352
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:54,270
anybody have a question okay hello I

353
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:58,380
have a question have you tested maximum

354
00:22:54,270 --> 00:23:05,430
possible speed of this Tom oh the the

355
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:08,790
speed yes yes 20 nights per second it's

356
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:11,250
slow yeah of course it's a covered

357
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:13,409
channel so that doesn't necessarily have

358
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:17,760
to be fast but yeah okay yeah thank you

359
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:22,620
but it is efficient it was cinder just a

360
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:24,750
commander there yeah but so this does

361
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:31,199
not make it useful for data exfiltration

362
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:33,390
right yeah if you send a fake file it's

363
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,080
it's almost impossible in the gate okay

364
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:42,660
okay

365
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:47,399
Thank You teacher yes thank you ah thank

366
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:49,680
you for your work what is it any

367
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:53,250
software need to be pre-installed on a

368
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:58,590
victim computer or it were cut off box

369
00:23:53,250 --> 00:24:00,540
on Windows 10 sorry

370
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:03,030
is it any software need to be

371
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:06,750
pre-installed on a victim computer yes

372
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:10,710
you need to implant a software onto the

373
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:16,430
victims computer hardware and software

374
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:16,430
on it you can use a USB HID

375
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:25,980
[Music]

376
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:37,299
Lydia said that it's vulnerable on

377
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:41,809
windows and Mike is DD tested on Linux

378
00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:46,210
different maybe its specifications about

379
00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:50,928
Linux Tech Bluetooth some way it just

380
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:56,860
sees that Mike OS SDK and it does has at

381
00:24:50,929 --> 00:25:02,480
her API but we didn't has today insisted

382
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:05,029
I of course Linux has data API what we

383
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,850
didn't test it yeah way we didn't touch

384
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:11,779
either way only tested on Windows 10 on

385
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:13,908
Linux did you test it yeah we tested on

386
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:18,309
the Windows 10 and we didn't I see there

387
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:18,309
are Mac OS and Linux Oh

388
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:32,629
since the report as the question is

389
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:36,279
doing it mr. Atif privileges on the

390
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:40,370
victims computer to install software

391
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:43,450
business oh it can be granting user

392
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:46,129
space user mode

393
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:48,110
sorry we need administrative privileges

394
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:52,639

395
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:56,418
on victims computer or any user can run

396
00:25:52,639 --> 00:26:01,219
it in the user mode without admin

397
00:25:56,419 --> 00:26:04,600
privileges you need a malicious software

398
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:06,679
who implants yes but doing it

399
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,418
administrator privileges to run it on

400
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:11,690
the victims computer in Windows 10 or

401
00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:15,910
any user on this computer controlled yes

402
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:19,929
the software should bypass

403
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:24,880
or syndication you know what you mean my

404
00:26:19,929 --> 00:26:27,580
