1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,859
that's why I've decided to cover it in

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,390
this presentation of course I only have

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:10,679
20 minutes and it would be very

4
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:13,670
difficult to get into TI the in detail

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:16,760
so just like to start with the basis

6
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:20,220
threat intelligence threat intelligence

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:23,720
is a process of collecting threat

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:28,619
related data there are typical basic

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:33,420
definitions feeds sources providers and

10
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:37,680
platforms of threats so let's start with

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:40,890
the sources there will be any source

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:45,809
about the threat that in dangerous your

13
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:48,450
organization telemetry external provider

14
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:51,349
a regulator there can be a sent box

15
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:56,030
related data but they can be may be

16
00:00:51,350 --> 00:01:00,000
split into internal and external ones

17
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:02,440
with one example I would like to

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,740
describe

19
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:08,850
how we can use multiple sources of data

20
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:10,839
both internal and external and

21
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:16,479
investigate the information regarding

22
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:19,890
the incident they may be a list of

23
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:23,460
malicious domains what is it

24
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:30,340
done about they have been monitored

25
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:35,020
alright so it works then then there's an

26
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:37,479
alert comes up what is the engineer

27
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:40,030
supposed to do what is the panel is

28
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:43,300
supposed to do there should be some kind

29
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:45,910
of playbooks but where do they check the

30
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:48,310
information first of all they may have

31
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:52,210
some external feeds of which we'll talk

32
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:56,369
later they can provide us the initial

33
00:01:52,210 --> 00:02:00,910
information about the indicators of the

34
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:04,330
compromised security signaling not just

35
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:07,060
the false or fake domain but it's

36
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:10,598
related to some kind of a bacon trojan

37
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:14,310
and there may be some other indicators

38
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:17,560
that would help us look for the

39
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:23,010
compromised security all right we'll

40
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:26,560
find a file and indicator wise it is

41
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:27,340
perfectly a nice match we send it to a

42
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,880
sandbox

43
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:33,510
it's our internal source of information

44
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:37,109
from which we would get much more

45
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:40,750
information about the files behavior

46
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:44,430
and we can see that is trying to

47
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,430
establish some network connections

48
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:52,909
or we may block all of the network

49
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:58,280
connections purge the system react on

50
00:02:52,909 --> 00:03:00,679
time but we just need to find out about

51
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:04,689
the source of the threat about the

52
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:10,400
source of the threat and the so called

53
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:15,790
Sint that's the intelligence based on

54
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:19,040
open source that will help us look for

55
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:22,548
analyzers databases that are available

56
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:26,439
for public access signaling that that

57
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:30,379
had been a leakage of some emails and

58
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:33,590
the credentials the passwords indicate

59
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:37,459
to some of our employees and from one of

60
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:42,769
the employees email they have been

61
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:48,699
fishing Direct Mail sent in batches and

62
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:53,180
they found it in the open source as well

63
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:58,909
a few words about feeds the feeds are

64
00:03:53,180 --> 00:04:01,189
would be a set of information of equal

65
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:04,040
type from different sources we split

66
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:07,759
them into three types the lists with the

67
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:11,929
indicators of threats they are outside

68
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:15,399
any contacts just signal in the URLs the

69
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:17,810
bad urls the bag hashes the bad IP

70
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,690
addresses you decide what to do with

71
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:23,960
them and then we have more structured

72
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:29,500
data structured data showing the context

73
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:33,409
the description what it's related to the

74
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:37,039
detection etc and there are some

75
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:40,870
comprehensive services that provide

76
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:43,759
comprehensive analytics with some

77
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:51,979
assessments with the estimates and so

78
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:55,789
forth what we'd have to pay our close

79
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:59,000
attention to the feeds the type of

80
00:04:55,789 --> 00:05:01,820
source the relevance etc you can read it

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,080
on the slide instead of just focus on

82
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:08,060
formats more because the base the basic

83
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:12,229
thing about Ti is the context of course

84
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:15,190
and sent in the context is complicated

85
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:18,500
because previously we had not had any

86
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:22,039
uniform formats that could be used in

87
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:25,460
any automated mode or could be utilized

88
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:29,690
by an analyst that's why I would like to

89
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:33,409
speak about the format's the first one

90
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:38,529
this sticks structured threat

91
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:42,260
information expression is free of charge

92
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:45,250
solution from MIT the Metreon company of

93
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,250
which you are aware

94
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:57,400
currently the Stix formant has de facto

95
00:05:52,300 --> 00:06:02,110
became has differed to become the format

96
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:07,530
of choice by multiple companies it has

97
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:11,650
some objects and relations some time ago

98
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:15,460
in October 2017 it had been updated to

99
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:18,400
sticks 2.0 that had become more

100
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:25,570
sophisticated and had been merged with

101
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:31,390
the JSON and this it has object so each

102
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:35,340
of them describing in essence there can

103
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:40,060
be a description of some hackers

104
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:45,039
vulnerabilities threats etc all these

105
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:49,330
items may have a relationship between

106
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:52,060
them by whom they'd been created how

107
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:56,680
they have been created and so forth the

108
00:06:52,060 --> 00:07:01,900
sticks format is considered to be a

109
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:04,030
popular one and it's suggested that we

110
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:07,719
use it to spread the information about

111
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:10,419
threats apart from apart from sticks I

112
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,970
would like to speak about Mike that's

113
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:17,590
how it's pronounced I may see the

114
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:19,770
uniform specific language intended for

115
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:26,349
describing the information about

116
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:30,430
malicious software actually sticks could

117
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:34,390
be used as a graphic representation but

118
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:38,620
also in JSON like I mentioned so going

119
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:42,599
back to Mike we have some information

120
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:48,449
about malware malware

121
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:50,878
and what does this malware do what how

122
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:53,999
do we learn about behavior there are

123
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:57,469
plenty of cloud solutions each of them

124
00:07:53,999 --> 00:08:01,830
indicates a report a report about

125
00:07:57,469 --> 00:08:05,629
certain malware behavior mic prompts us

126
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:11,149
that we use most standardized

127
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:14,369
description of the malware behavior

128
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:19,559
indicate and the family groups the

129
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:26,339
behavior type and the actual relation to

130
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:29,580
the sticks objects moving on the feeds

131
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:38,448
without the context what are we supposed

132
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:42,568
to do with them our experience tells us

133
00:08:38,448 --> 00:08:46,589
that IOC without context are supposed to

134
00:08:42,568 --> 00:08:49,560
be split into two parts the network

135
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:52,970
based a host based the first group would

136
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:56,219
not necessarily us prompt us about the

137
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:59,759
breached system they must be double

138
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:02,370
checked and verified the hosts ones are

139
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:05,430
more frequently related to the malicious

140
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:09,060
ones or suspicious ones at least where

141
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:12,689
we'd have to raise the bar and beyond

142
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:15,449
the alert and the relevance test the

143
00:09:12,689 --> 00:09:20,189
relevance test is the actual ability to

144
00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:24,569
use the so called white lists or we may

145
00:09:20,189 --> 00:09:27,870
utilize the open source based descent

146
00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:31,170
like solutions from Cisco there are

147
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:35,600
plenty more of open source solutions

148
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:35,599
that are not expensive

149
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:43,630
that would let in thousands and

150
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:46,220
thousands of pages of the indicators of

151
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:52,910
context and with the use of the lean

152
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:55,820
Walt they can prompt you on the militias

153
00:09:52,910 --> 00:10:01,930
behavior and then use a standardized

154
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:01,930
recipe and send all that to the uniform

155
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:12,199
collection point I will elaborate on

156
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:16,399
that threat intelligence providers they

157
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:20,750
can be the company which generates feeds

158
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:23,690
with the in-house analysts having

159
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:27,880
machine learning algorithms established

160
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:32,149
and multiple sources of both open and

161
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:35,329
private ones where they would collect

162
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:35,930
the information from and report it back

163
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:38,239
to you

164
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:44,329
and there are plenty of professional

165
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:48,140
services the professional services of

166
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:49,670
what formerly they may be comprehensive

167
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:53,930
they may be a platform they may be

168
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:57,260
States they may be sources of your my

169
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:58,660
mean of production

170
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:01,630
[Music]

171
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:07,360
and these sources provide information or

172
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:09,970
threats then it's time for threat

173
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,420
intelligence platform to act threat

174
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:16,630
intelligence platform if something that

175
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:20,709
allows to compel correlate and analyze

176
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:21,430
their data from various sources why not

177
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:24,460
see you

178
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:28,290
well because cm is still very different

179
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:31,470
functionality yes you can do it was that

180
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:35,370
yes you can do it through the list

181
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:39,700
contest and that but cm initially is not

182
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:45,010
there to use large blocks of information

183
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:49,330
on threats not sticks not Mike the it is

184
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:51,520
not capable of classifying so let us

185
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:52,960
look at threat intelligence platform

186
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,720
functions its aggregation and

187
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,680
correlation of multiple faiths in one

188
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,610
location

189
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:04,079
it's a normalization of data

190
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:08,620
it's the getting notification in online

191
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:13,000
form on real threats as integration with

192
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:18,820
CM and I have these firewalls and also

193
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:21,340
creation of all kinds of reports so what

194
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:25,540
threat intelligent intelligence platform

195
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:29,220
cannot do they cannot provide context

196
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:31,990
information on threats yes you can buy a

197
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:34,440
commercial platform that would have a

198
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:38,519
separate

199
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:41,209
provider that would be there to give

200
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:43,860
analytic data above the platform but

201
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:45,420
generally speaking initially the

202
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,860
platform does not provide you with

203
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,120
context information and strength

204
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,790
intelligence is not there to identify

205
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:54,689
threats but rather to collect

206
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:56,879
information that is to say you need a

207
00:12:54,689 --> 00:13:05,129
human analyst at all times

208
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:07,170
anyway now on to the general schema how

209
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:11,220
this is all brought together so we have

210
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:15,300
providers vendors providers of four

211
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:17,699
feeds these foods are picked on the

212
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:21,389
basis of certain criteria you carry out

213
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:26,399
unification using this that's standard

214
00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:29,550
like stakes or something then you use

215
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,519
the internal sources for enriching your

216
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:34,620
data then you put it into thread

217
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:36,839
Intelligence Platform integrated and use

218
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,040
human analytics because the most

219
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,620
important thing about threat

220
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,019
intelligence is to give the information

221
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:46,050
security specialist the data and the

222
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:49,560
context for the realization and for

223
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:54,240
decision-makers this is it this is a

224
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:56,069
road map that one could use to build

225
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:01,259
threat intelligence process and in our

226
00:13:56,069 --> 00:14:03,300
stance we demonstrate this whole process

227
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:04,800
on the girl or the best of the case that

228
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,689
I was referring to because of my

229
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:11,639
presentation so I'd be happy to take

230
00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:13,709
your questions please make sure you use

231
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:16,160
the mic for the city of broadcasting

232
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:16,160
thank you

233
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,210
thank you very much for this

234
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:29,939
presentation my main question is what

235
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:34,200
are the criteria for choosing fees there

236
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:36,750
are all kinds of faiths all kinds of

237
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,910
vendors and all of them if you context

238
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,670
how to pick the failure that's right

239
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:45,329
reorganization well to be quite frank

240
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:47,579
with you the context it's something that

241
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:50,910
you don't really get not enough of at

242
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:53,480
least especially if we're referring to

243
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:58,920
open source provides like myth circles

244
00:14:53,480 --> 00:15:06,480
they provided anomaly provides various

245
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:08,819
context but mostly you should look at

246
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,920
stress described in a unified former

247
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:14,190
because this gives you context and if

248
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:17,910
you have context it allows you to enrich

249
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:20,220
the incidents and it's more much more

250
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:25,050
useful iíve seen commercial faiths that

251
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:32,570
would just give you the main malicious

252
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:35,000
and then name of exact file executable

253
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:37,100
besides relevance feeds needs to be

254
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,960
relevant the earlier they come the

255
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,390
earlier you get information to play the

256
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:48,560
more relevant they are thank you for

257
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:50,600
this question thank you for this

258
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:54,560
presentation I have two questions how

259
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:57,920
you verify data that is to say if you

260
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,869
get information only the main that it

261
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,930
has low reputation how to verify that

262
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:06,230
it's still relevant and it still has a

263
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:08,510
low reputation and then say it you've

264
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,330
downloaded half step and then you

265
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:12,950
manually take the decision how to

266
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:15,110
automate it so that system uses it and

267
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,730
that's day-to-day operation well in

268
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:21,830
answering your first question if I got

269
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:23,630
it right you mean how to verify that the

270
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:25,940
domain that is given to us a little

271
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:30,620
reputation domain that you don't want to

272
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:33,980
use it right right okay its relevancy

273
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:36,650
check that i mentioned above before

274
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:39,530
threat intelligence platform you may

275
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:44,030
want to use a service a local service

276
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:48,920
like a center that it's capable of doing

277
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:52,910
this verification for example if this

278
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:54,709
virus is not there in various analyzers

279
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:59,709
it will just pass do you have any

280
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:59,710
statistics like any percentages as to

281
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:09,589
how many live feeds reach the user for

282
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:11,000
really real usage I never collected this

283
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:14,119
statistics the second question on

284
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
automation automation well this is

285
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:19,219
largely depends on the type of platform

286
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,579
you make use of if you use an

287
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:24,300
open-source platform you'll have to do a

288
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:26,659
lot of stuff manually

289
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:32,879
if you use a commercial platform however

290
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:36,930
then off the shelf out of the box it has

291
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:39,960
a large IP API that allows you to

292
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:43,890
integrate with a per system and serum

293
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:48,090
system you just unit and there you go

294
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:53,130
the process runs so I follow up

295
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:57,840
how about downloading fades into these

296
00:17:53,130 --> 00:18:02,990
systems why would they use platform they

297
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:06,540
threat intelligence but well context

298
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:08,250
classification putting things together

299
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:16,200
gathering things together in one point

300
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:18,650
thank you do we have any other questions

301
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,650
from the floor

302
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:33,259
thank you you you mentioned sticks as a

303
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:35,449
way to exchange information or threats

304
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:37,700
have you carried out any research on

305
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:42,109
whether or not it's needed in the market

306
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:43,669
and what actually is usable sticks 1 2 /

307
00:18:42,109 --> 00:18:46,158
2 2 0

308
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:53,049
now I never researched it but I

309
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:53,049
encountered various platforms and most

310
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:04,908
they are say that they support stakes 1

311
00:18:59,629 --> 00:19:09,350
2 or 2 0 while they try to actually work

312
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:12,739
on the house but just on is more simple

313
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:18,080
cell they try to go with sticks silver

314
00:19:12,739 --> 00:19:22,460
to 22.0 are there any any other

315
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:26,928
questions a volume of data transfer

316
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:30,559
between almond cm is it capable of doing

317
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:35,659
its own correlation rules you know can

318
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:36,379
TI platform creates relation rules no it

319
00:19:35,659 --> 00:19:39,489
cannot

320
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:43,158
so then what's the volume of integration

321
00:19:39,489 --> 00:19:48,590
its transfer of information on threads

322
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:51,999
into CM the lists etc but then it has to

323
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:51,999
be contextualized

324
00:19:55,130 --> 00:20:01,760
any other questions from the phone we

325
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:04,900
still have time for more questions no

326
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,900
thank you very much then
