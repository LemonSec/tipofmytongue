1
00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:04,529
the last time I was here I spoke about

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:07,048
security research and how we hack mobile

3
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:09,240
networks I'm still a security researcher

4
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:11,759
at heart but it spent most of my

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,700
professional time as a security manager

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,160
and large organizations and today I want

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,049
to share a few experiences going back

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,359
and forth between these two worlds of

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,240
offensive freak security research and

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:28,439
trying to defend from within the

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,929
companies and as the short summary those

12
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,630
two worlds have little to do with one

13
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:36,510
another we seem to be working on the

14
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:39,149
same topic but from very different

15
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,849
perspectives contributing very little to

16
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:45,329
each other and today I want to change

17
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,370
that one way to look at it as security

18
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,379
researchers they have to move on and on

19
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,739
and on to new topics every single year

20
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:54,989
it's very dynamic where as security

21
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:58,140
managers at least the five years that

22
00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:00,209
I've done it the same topics keep coming

23
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,030
back up and back up and back up and a

24
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,159
lot of those have to do with legacy so

25
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,130
being a security managers a lot more

26
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,810
constant and under the theme of this

27
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,000
conference of course I want to break the

28
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,790
concent we want to contribute so that

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,710
security managers don't have to again

30
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:22,259
and again address the same issues before

31
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:26,070
diving deep into that let me ask you

32
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:29,340
guys a question of these two people who

33
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:33,899
do you think will fully digitized their

34
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:35,880
lives faster so I've my answer probably

35
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,189
you have yours as well we'll come back

36
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,140
to this question a little bit later but

37
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:43,258
for the moment we'll stay with the

38
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:47,520
gentleman on your right in India where I

39
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:50,579
spent three years myself in a true

40
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,009
greenfield startup in a literal sense

41
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,089
greenfield that there were green fields

42
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,700
and then we build a lot of buildings

43
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,950
tons of buildings a huge campus for this

44
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,159
new company but also in a metaphorical

45
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,149
sense of Greenfield we could do whatever

46
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,640
we wanted

47
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:09,780
there was nothing before us no legacy

48
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,000
all decisions were still to be made and

49
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,490
there were made it was in a few years

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,310
the company I'm talking

51
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:19,670
about is called geo which is the Hindi

52
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:22,250
word for life and the ambition of this

53
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:24,980
company was to bring Internet and

54
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:27,710
digital services to hundreds of millions

55
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:30,109
of people who had never connected to the

56
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:34,850
internet before so very groundbreaking

57
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:38,630
for India and a great example of how

58
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:40,640
innovation can happen the founder of

59
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:42,200
this company Mukesh Ambani he doesn't

60
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,690
even call it a company calls it a

61
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,730
movement so that's how determined he is

62
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:48,890
that's how much energy is behind her he

63
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:51,170
says he wants to mobilize hundreds of

64
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:54,290
millions of people on the way to the

65
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:56,179
internet right and he backed it up was

66
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:59,810
enough money about thirty five billion

67
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:01,640
dollars to really make it a movement we

68
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:03,530
had a hundred thousand people we

69
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,779
deployed two hundred thousand radio

70
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:08,450
towers all over the country we launched

71
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:13,220
a few hundred applications so everything

72
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:15,890
massive for instance when we when we had

73
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,930
built of first 4G network we needed some

74
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:20,239
people to test it and we started giving

75
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:22,040
out free SIM cards to the employees and

76
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,680
they gave them out to their families and

77
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,720
friends and soon enough we had more than

78
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,390
a million people testing this network

79
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,980
just family and friends a million people

80
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:33,500
and they gave us the confidence to

81
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:35,480
launch nationwide and we had a hundred

82
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,520
million people using this network a

83
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,310
hundred million people all standing in

84
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:43,430
line to get a SIM card in less than half

85
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:46,670
a year and that of course is is

86
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:48,710
innovation and and mobilization that I

87
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:51,200
had never seen before and it was great

88
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:54,320
to contribute to that but now how do you

89
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,690
secure this right how do you secure a

90
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,329
company that changes everything

91
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:01,970
overnight or not overnight but was in

92
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:03,880
six months that impacts the lives of a

93
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:06,260
hundred million people who have never

94
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,269
been in touch with the internet who

95
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,549
don't know what a password is who know

96
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:12,200
what a spam email is a hundred million

97
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:16,549
people in a nationwide critical

98
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:18,469
infrastructure so let's start with what

99
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:21,079
may seem like the positive as I said

100
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:24,169
this is true greenfield no technology

101
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:26,359
before us we could truly do what

102
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:27,289
everybody refers to as security by

103
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,930
design we

104
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:33,590
design everything from scratch and for

105
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:36,140
instance in 4G networks everything was

106
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:38,750
actually designed from scratch for this

107
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:40,880
network generation very little

108
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:43,790
technology was carried over from 2g and

109
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,300
3G to 4G every single box you see here

110
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:49,760
was designed for 4G all the protocols

111
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:52,730
spoken between these boxes were designed

112
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:56,360
for 4G so nothing old everything well

113
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:58,760
encrypted well authenticated however if

114
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,950
you give such a good design now to any

115
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,530
network vendor there's still find ways

116
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:05,030
to screw it up for instance when we got

117
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,440
our first boxes shipped and they were

118
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:08,359
made just for us there was no other

119
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,330
custom anywhere in the world they had

120
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,490
eight years of patches missing somebody

121
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:15,830
had copy pasted some old Linux

122
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:18,170
distribution and then put our our soft

123
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,729
one at eight years for a product that

124
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:21,670
had never been used anywhere in the

125
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:24,980
world

126
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:27,710
similarly the management protocols used

127
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,720
for these these boxes that aren't

128
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,130
specified where every vendor can choose

129
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,610
whatever they want that were from the

130
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:38,180
80s telnet FTP unencrypted badly

131
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:40,730
authenticated protocols and speaking of

132
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:43,070
authentication the password for the

133
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:44,930
first 80,000 notes we deployed was all

134
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:48,320
the same password and was the vendors

135
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:50,000
name so we had to send people to 80,000

136
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,580
locations in India to change passwords

137
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,280
and luckily we still had time to do that

138
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:57,710
others do not right that applies similar

139
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,280
technology and from the first day that

140
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:04,669
they go life was a greenfield network

141
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:07,250
secure by design their stock was 10

142
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:09,200
years of missing patches and was 30 year

143
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,030
old authentication protocols and all

144
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:15,500
using the same password they're all

145
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:18,109
stock and legacy there is no legacy free

146
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:21,170
mobile network however hard you try and

147
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:23,720
that extends well beyond mobile networks

148
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:27,440
into basically all other areas of

149
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:29,270
technology we wanted to allow our

150
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,760
employees with about a hundred thousand

151
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,570
people at a time to use fingerprint for

152
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,760
authentication

153
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:38,599
instead of passwords you know phishing

154
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:40,849
big problem that just won't happen in a

155
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,980
Microsoft Kerberos environment

156
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:45,440
just isn't a way to get rid of passwords

157
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:47,390
similarly was Android phones we tried to

158
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,340
find a vendor who could create an

159
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:51,950
Android phone for us was all patches

160
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,929
installed sounds easy right but no

161
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:55,969
chance there's nobody who can install

162
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:59,330
all the different kernel patches for

163
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:03,170
instance reliably right from day one

164
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:06,169
however hard you try you're in a swamp

165
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:08,780
of legacy issues right security by

166
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:10,880
design just isn't happening and then of

167
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,440
course there's the biggest legacy and a

168
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,050
few hi a hundred thousand people

169
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:18,770
disarmed you know the best-educated IT

170
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:20,540
people very diverse people and most of

171
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:22,940
them fall for phishing right at least a

172
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:25,010
one in a startup company it's hard to

173
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,330
secure from this because everything

174
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:29,000
changes every day you get different

175
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:31,430
emails all the time and all read a

176
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,870
little bit wonky kind of half of the

177
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:35,960
email you receive could be phishing

178
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:40,460
emails right but 60% oh my god this is

179
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:42,650
by far the weakest link at that point we

180
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,260
got it down to single digits percentages

181
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:47,539
but still that means twenty phishing

182
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,370
emails later you get a password and we

183
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:51,740
couldn't get rid of passwords because of

184
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:55,280
Microsoft so again we're stuck in a

185
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:57,530
swamp of legacy issues and so is

186
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,440
everybody else now at the time that

187
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:03,289
wasn't clear to me how dependent we are

188
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,450
on on technologies that other companies

189
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:07,160
bring us and behaviors that our

190
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:09,979
employees have learned somewhere else

191
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:12,650
before working for us but everybody is

192
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:14,750
stuck in these legacy issues and of

193
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:17,870
course there's a negative way of looking

194
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:20,000
at it to say we're all doomed we will

195
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,620
all die from these legacy issues there's

196
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,050
also a positive way to look at it if

197
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:28,310
really everybody has the same issues and

198
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:30,350
surprisingly little a little hacking is

199
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:32,630
happening right now right then what we

200
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:35,479
feel is a terrible security level is

201
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:38,150
actually pretty acceptable right all the

202
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:41,000
great companies that secure this is very

203
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:43,520
well they to suffer from these legacy

204
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,410
issues maybe to somewhat lesser extent

205
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,860
but nobody can completely get rid of

206
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:49,670
them

207
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:52,550
so I wanted to understand how widespread

208
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:54,260
are these issues so after this

209
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,849
experience in India had one measurement

210
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,370
point and you should never extrapolate

211
00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:00,740
from a single data point of course so I

212
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:03,200
set out on a three-year journey to

213
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:08,030
collect data on as many companies as

214
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:11,330
possible as far as it the exposure to

215
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:13,550
legacy issues and let me quickly speak

216
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:15,500
about the setup of this experiment so

217
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:19,810
you can appreciate how much data went

218
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:23,080
into this we started with a list of the

219
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:26,719
300,000 largest companies in the world

220
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:30,170
and then we selected a subset of those

221
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,090
as our scan group to be representative

222
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:35,120
of all regions of the world of all

223
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:38,300
industries and so forth but still a huge

224
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,700
sample of companies and we try to

225
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:43,040
dissect the Internet to say which

226
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,990
internet assets belong to which of these

227
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,370
largest companies in the world

228
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:51,740
we use different Whois databases

229
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:54,380
certificates wiki data some other

230
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,900
corporate databases to know which

231
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:59,240
company owns which other company to CD

232
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:03,709
structures and even some machine

233
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:05,660
learning to then find a set of 270

234
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:07,880
million IP addresses that we wanted to

235
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:10,160
scan and of course that's not the

236
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,930
largest scan ever done you know some of

237
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,850
you will regularly scan the entire

238
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:15,589
internet but I think this scan is

239
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,410
different in two ways

240
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:21,560
first of all we know the context of

241
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:23,120
every single IP address so for each IP

242
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,400
address that we scan we know which

243
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,610
company belongs to what industry that is

244
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:30,230
in what country the company is what's

245
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:32,810
the GDP of the country how many

246
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:35,720
employees do they have what revenue they

247
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:38,239
have and we can do statistical analysis

248
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:41,300
along all of these dimensions so we have

249
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,030
270 million data points now and we can

250
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:48,020
we can correlate with any of those and

251
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:50,930
many more right the second difference to

252
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:52,520
the normal research scan is that we

253
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,680
don't look for one particular

254
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,770
vulnerability like if somebody is say

255
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,900
scans the entire internet for heartbleed

256
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:02,060
but we applied everything that we have

257
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:04,100
learned in ten years of pen testing and

258
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,560
red teaming so we had hundreds of

259
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,090
vulnerability signatures and we ran each

260
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,209
of those against each of the

261
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:14,450
P addresses to find us this very rich

262
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:16,310
data set of what vulnerabilities are

263
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:20,200
present in which countries in which

264
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:22,959
industries and so forth right and

265
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,940
there's plenty that are very very common

266
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:28,550
so this is scaled up to a million

267
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,320
corporate IP addresses now and if you

268
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:32,810
find a million active corporate IP

269
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,970
addresses as one example the one in the

270
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:37,969
darkest color here you find more than

271
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:40,040
three thousand accidentally exposed

272
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:42,620
source code repositories for instance

273
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:45,319
right there's a common mistake you clone

274
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:47,150
something into Webroot forgetting that

275
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,340
now the whole world can access your

276
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:52,160
private source code repository and then

277
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:54,530
people forget to remove it or forget to

278
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:58,130
restrict access to it but also other

279
00:11:54,530 --> 00:12:00,560
issues look at the heartbleed a tenth of

280
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:03,250
a percent of corporate IP addresses

281
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:07,699
still today are vulnerable to heartbleed

282
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:10,370
I'll look at the VMware one about a

283
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:13,100
two-tenths of a percent of all corporate

284
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:15,020
IP addresses have an exposed VMware

285
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,300
interface right I didn't even know

286
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:20,630
VMware was that popular but so these are

287
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,490
tens of thousands of VMware hypervisors

288
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:25,730
whose management interface is on the

289
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:28,790
open Internet if there's ever an RC e

290
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:32,060
pre orson vmware half of the internet

291
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:34,520
will be down because of this right so

292
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:37,790
you see patterns in in these issues that

293
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:39,860
are kind of along the lifecycle of an

294
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,900
asset so if you install a new technology

295
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,780
first you're supposed to change the

296
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:47,060
passwords then you restrict access to it

297
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:49,699
more in a firewall level and switch off

298
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:52,939
unnecessary services you go through

299
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:55,100
hardening as a one-time activity and

300
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:57,770
then you can continuously patch whenever

301
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:00,890
there's patches available and in each of

302
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:02,930
these steps almost everybody makes

303
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:04,580
mistakes and we're talking about the

304
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:05,900
largest companies in the world here I'm

305
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:08,690
not talking about your home router

306
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:12,110
that's not part of the scan the largest

307
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:14,590
companies have issues and are usually

308
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:16,670
the same and they're usually old issues

309
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:18,530
that's what I said going in as a

310
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:21,020
security researcher I'm addressing

311
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:21,860
something new every year as a security

312
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,260
manager

313
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:26,839
I still have to fight was heartbleed I

314
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:30,200
still have to fight with people not

315
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:31,700
changing the default passwords right you

316
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:35,209
can never give a conference presentation

317
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:38,390
on the number of default passwords when

318
00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:40,010
I'm trying but usually those wouldn't be

319
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:42,410
selected nobody wants to hear about this

320
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:44,510
is old news we already know about it but

321
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:48,170
as a security manager that is your

322
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:51,800
day-to-day business and this is true

323
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:54,649
across pretty much all industries but to

324
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,839
make them comparable we define what we

325
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:59,360
call the hack ability score so it's

326
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:01,250
basically a way that some of these

327
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,890
different issues are weighted by

328
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:07,190
severity so straight exploit will have

329
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:09,350
more of a score than some best practice

330
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:12,470
deviation that might make exploitation

331
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:15,380
easier and again we summarized over all

332
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:17,899
of these different issues if you're

333
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:19,490
interested more on on how we compete

334
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:23,329
that ability score here's some some

335
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:26,360
references that explain that deeper but

336
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:29,410
generally we can now condense the HEC

337
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:32,870
ability of a company to a single number

338
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:35,180
which I'm not sure this existed before

339
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:37,250
at least I was looking and couldn't find

340
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,959
something that I could benchmark myself

341
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:41,390
against says as for instance this

342
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,829
company in India so if we now have two

343
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:45,260
single number we can start comparing

344
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:48,520
companies for instance across industries

345
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:52,490
and there seem to be two ways to be

346
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:54,399
relatively secure and that is either you

347
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:57,740
mostly stay away from the internet as

348
00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:00,079
retailers do and I don't think that's a

349
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:02,240
protection strategy that's just a side

350
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:05,060
effect of them being far behind in

351
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,490
digitization most retailers don't do

352
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:10,430
much over the internet yet right and

353
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:12,800
that keeps them somewhat protected and

354
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,779
then the alternative to strategy of

355
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,240
course that financials like insurance

356
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:20,720
companies and banks do is they actually

357
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:23,269
invest in security and big banks will

358
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,260
invest hundreds of millions of dollars

359
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:29,630
in security every year right ridiculous

360
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,790
amounts but of course they have

361
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:34,560
identified this as a business case

362
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:36,629
mostly branding I believe though

363
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,300
compare that though with kind of the

364
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:40,889
worst companies for instance technology

365
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:43,709
services providers these are companies

366
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:46,379
that run IT for other so cheap

367
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:50,399
outsourcing companies and because this

368
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:52,620
is a a price mediated market usually the

369
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,709
cheapest option wins and so you get what

370
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:57,720
you pay for and those people they don't

371
00:15:55,709 --> 00:16:00,599
offer much security also they just

372
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,370
wouldn't have the budgets to do that but

373
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:06,149
between somebody who has barely any

374
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:08,309
security and a big bank on average the

375
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:10,680
Big Bang only has about half as much

376
00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:13,559
exposure so you spend a hundred times

377
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:16,349
more money to reduce your risk by 50%

378
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:18,749
that doesn't seem like a good use of of

379
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:21,089
your money right again because these

380
00:16:18,749 --> 00:16:24,240
legacy issues are so absolutely

381
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:29,279
prevalent that even at a hundred million

382
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:31,139
budget you can't fully mitigate them now

383
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,230
this was looking at it by industry now

384
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:36,480
let's look by region different regions

385
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:39,149
have very different characteristics here

386
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,420
comparing North America to Europe to

387
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:45,899
East Asia being China Korea and Japan

388
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:50,180
mostly and the first thing we notice is

389
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:52,949
that in the US they expose a lot more

390
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:55,829
technology to the Internet than on

391
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:57,479
average and in East Asia much less that

392
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:58,620
might be due to you know the Great

393
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,449
Firewall of China

394
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,790
we've course not scanning from inside

395
00:17:00,449 --> 00:17:05,639
China so a lot of that might be shielded

396
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:09,059
from our scans in Europe were somewhere

397
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:11,459
around the global average right so that

398
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:14,730
means comparable companies in Europe in

399
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:16,589
the US the American company will expose

400
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:18,539
more onto the internet that will be

401
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:21,958
further ahead in digitization they have

402
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:24,030
more bets running right now modern

403
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,130
application that may make them some more

404
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:27,959
money in the future right whereas the

405
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:30,390
European company on average is a little

406
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:32,640
bit more conservative stays a little bit

407
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:34,860
behind the digitization let's the

408
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,770
Americans try stuff out first and maybe

409
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:39,959
copy some good ideas right and you'd

410
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:41,820
think that that's partly inspired that

411
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,950
I'm trying to be secure right

412
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,840
your technology conservative because

413
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:47,530
you're afraid of new technology at least

414
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,810
in parts

415
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:51,520
now the effect that this seems to be

416
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:54,250
having is the opposite though if you

417
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,440
look at the bottom part of the slide her

418
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:58,810
IP address exposed on the Internet

419
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:02,470
European companies make a lot more

420
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:05,950
mistakes on average right so you stay

421
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:07,810
behind in the digitization but you also

422
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:09,370
deprive yourself of the learning

423
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:11,679
opportunity of how to deal with

424
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:15,159
technology so you're not actually

425
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:16,930
effectively lowering your risk you're

426
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,540
only effectively blowing your

427
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:22,240
opportunity right terrible trade off

428
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:23,470
kind of the worst of both worlds and you

429
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,280
can see that for instance in North

430
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:29,800
America and then in Asia a relatively

431
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,020
comparable number of mistakes are made

432
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:34,840
so in Europe we're just much worse than

433
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:37,090
all the other regions partly because we

434
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:40,120
don't give ourselves a chance to explore

435
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:41,949
to learn about technology right now put

436
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:44,739
these two views together the industry

437
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:47,980
view and that the regional view let's

438
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:50,110
look at for instance how banks are

439
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:53,820
faring in these different regions so

440
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:55,929
again Europe the worst which

441
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,970
specifically are on banking is

442
00:18:55,930 --> 00:19:00,250
surprising because banks are regulated

443
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:03,520
in all regions so you think that they

444
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:05,560
reach a similar level but apparently

445
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,050
even that doesn't help European banks

446
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:10,750
understanding and well managing their

447
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:13,600
systems one thing you will see though

448
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:16,030
here is the effect of regulation so

449
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,730
there's a positive effect and a negative

450
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:21,850
side effect the positive effect that

451
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:24,070
regulators usually make publish

452
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:26,260
mandatory hardening lists then ordered

453
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:27,970
them there's a once-a-year activity and

454
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:30,580
you can see that compared to all other

455
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:32,500
industries on the Left the banks have a

456
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:35,260
much smaller percentage of hardening

457
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,940
gaps right so it seems to work if the

458
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:39,550
regulator once a year checks your

459
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:42,670
hardening status you try harder to pass

460
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:45,490
that tollgate but that automatically

461
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:48,160
directs attention away from other topics

462
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:52,060
like patching for instance so banks are

463
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:54,340
surprisingly bad in applying patches why

464
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:56,620
because the regulator can't create a

465
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:59,360
checklist that's up to date with all the

466
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:01,399
patches as new patches every single day

467
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,949
and no regulator can keep up with that

468
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:06,830
so the fact of regulation may very well

469
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:09,650
be a negative effect because you're your

470
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:14,030
dad redirecting attention away from

471
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:16,460
where it actually met us right now I

472
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:19,700
won't have time to dive much much deeper

473
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:22,220
into this data set but you invited to do

474
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:24,320
that we published the aggregate

475
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:27,080
information on on our website as olives

476
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,120
de for you to play around with

477
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,980
I should apologize that Russia is a

478
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,229
little bit underrepresented in our data

479
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,059
set just by the way how we selected

480
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:37,309
companies starting with the largest in

481
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:39,320
the world even though you take up a big

482
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:42,530
part of the map there aren't all that

483
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:44,899
many companies that that made it into

484
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:48,320
our selection but yeah you can play

485
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:50,660
around with this data on on this map of

486
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,549
few dimensions that that we prepared for

487
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:56,330
you to play around with a listed here

488
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:58,250
and some of my insightful or almost

489
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:00,460
obvious for instance if we look at

490
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:02,240
companies that have a bad IP reputation

491
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,610
for instance because there were

492
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,040
spendings sending spam and in the past

493
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:10,549
they usually have a higher hack ability

494
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:12,530
if we look at companies who have a bug

495
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:15,049
bounty program they have a lower hack

496
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:18,740
ability as you would expect but it kind

497
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:21,080
of confirms that this data set is is

498
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:24,530
rigid and strong right so play around

499
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:26,809
with it if you happen to work at any of

500
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:28,760
these companies go ahead and download

501
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:30,490
the report so we give you the one

502
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:34,309
reporter matches your email address

503
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:39,470
autobahn security a dress right so help

504
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:41,690
us make the internet more secure now

505
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:43,730
what is all of this mean of for security

506
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:46,700
management coming back to my personal

507
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:48,530
story in India now realizing that there

508
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:52,190
is an upper ceiling for security and

509
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:53,960
that that we won't be able to reach what

510
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:57,260
a security researcher would call an

511
00:21:53,960 --> 00:22:01,070
acceptable level of security ever how we

512
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:03,830
how do we now deal with was still the

513
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:07,909
responsibility for the company and for

514
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:10,790
the customer data the personal model

515
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:13,040
that that that I have learned over the

516
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:15,500
years is management start by measuring

517
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:18,170
you need to again start creating a data

518
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:20,810
foundation to start working on it

519
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:23,060
and we measure security in three ways

520
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:27,010
that automatically kind of lead to

521
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:27,010
improvement where it matters the most

522
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:33,620
this roughly cover protection detection

523
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:35,570
and response comfort the normal

524
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:38,300
management disciplines that every

525
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:40,429
security manager has to deal with but

526
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:42,440
they condense it into a single number

527
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:44,630
that can be measured through technical

528
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,610
tests so the mean time to breach is

529
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:49,580
basically how long does a red team uh

530
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:53,120
take to break into your systems the

531
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:55,460
detection coverage is for each of the

532
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:58,340
standard hacking methods applied what is

533
00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:00,500
your chance to catch it and it mean time

534
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:02,980
to respond obviously is how long do you

535
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:05,960
take to roll incident response and to

536
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:08,840
limit the damage right so in in

537
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,610
isolation if you measured them you get

538
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:14,000
pretty shocking results the mean time to

539
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:16,100
breach usually is below one week when

540
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,960
you all have done red team's or senior

541
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:20,480
results right it's never more than a

542
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,280
week until a compromise of an

543
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,180
application or even full compromise

544
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:27,649
right and that looked at in isolation

545
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:29,960
paints a very bleak picture right if you

546
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:32,390
tell a manager somewhere the company I

547
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,820
can hack you by paying a heck of four

548
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:37,790
day rates or five day rates right that's

549
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:39,470
a shockingly known low number given the

550
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:42,110
value of that company and how much you

551
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:43,790
can steal there similarly was detection

552
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:46,129
coverage those numbers are usually

553
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:48,350
somewhere below fifty percent and again

554
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:50,480
that Naumann isolation basically means

555
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:52,879
you can't detect most of the hacking

556
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,950
activity in your systems and again the

557
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,630
mean time to respond it's never better

558
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:59,630
than 24 hours I mean this is already

559
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:02,080
really good but if you tell the company

560
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:04,490
that you're losing a whole day of

561
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,770
responding to an incident right that

562
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:09,080
does not seem like a good story to tell

563
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:12,230
and I put them together though and the

564
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:14,720
picture looks completely different so

565
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:17,660
good through good technical work you

566
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,370
delay the hacker by four days it could

567
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,350
be much worse it could be just a

568
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:23,870
straight exploit and done know the

569
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:25,219
hacker has to try many things for four

570
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:27,320
days

571
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:29,000
and for each thing that there try again

572
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,010
at wente percent chance of detecting

573
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,650
that and because they go through dozens

574
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:35,450
of different things you have an e a

575
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:38,840
hundred percent chance of catching them

576
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:40,370
sometime during those four days and then

577
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:43,030
you have a full day to the incident

578
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:45,559
response and in almost all cases you

579
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:47,570
finished your incident response before

580
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:49,850
the hacker broke through to where they

581
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:51,889
need to be right so put them together

582
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:54,139
and all the sudden these terrible

583
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:56,360
numbers they seem like good enough

584
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:58,700
in fact this thing like numbers that we

585
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,979
could reach despite all these legacy

586
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,630
problems despite everything and they

587
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,760
might exactly be the numbers that

588
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:07,600
explained well the world hasn't ended

589
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:09,919
yet despite as a security researcher

590
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:13,039
predicting that every single year for

591
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,570
the last 20 years all right so let's go

592
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,010
a little bit deeper into the mean time

593
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:19,100
to breach how do we actually measure

594
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:21,020
that and many of you you are so close to

595
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:23,059
measuring this through your daily work

596
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:25,700
already because you're doing all of

597
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:27,590
these technical analyses from the

598
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:30,860
outside from the inside scanning red

599
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:33,110
teaming pentesting but you're not

600
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:35,510
translating it yet into the mean time to

601
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:38,209
bridge but that's just a tiny step

602
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:39,140
you're doing 99% of the work already

603
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:43,210
right

604
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:45,770
because in in my perception Hecker's

605
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:48,590
goes through multiple steps in a process

606
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:50,750
and each of your tests shows one or more

607
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:52,908
of these steps so the steps roughly

608
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:55,429
being for instance these five from the

609
00:25:52,909 --> 00:25:57,950
complete outside all the way to have

610
00:25:55,429 --> 00:26:01,370
Windows Active Directory take over so

611
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:04,220
each of your technical tests is an

612
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:07,129
indication how long one or more of these

613
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:08,720
steps take right and then you can map

614
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:10,220
them you know you take your tests and

615
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,250
you take these five steps and you see

616
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:16,880
what matches was what and then you often

617
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:18,980
see that hacker has multiple possible

618
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,600
paths through your system right you can

619
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,760
either fish some money or you can send

620
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:25,549
an email virus or you can hack the web

621
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:28,129
server these are all ways to gain an

622
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:30,379
initial foothold in organization so each

623
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:34,730
of these steps has multiple alternatives

624
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:37,730
and s you color coded in this case as

625
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:39,190
you become aware of the times involved

626
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:41,200
to DT of these steps

627
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:44,350
you see kind of disorders passed through

628
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:47,470
the systems basically for each column

629
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:49,449
the darkest color that's the preferred

630
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:51,580
pass for the HEC and it's the path of

631
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:53,530
least resistance and then you sum them

632
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:55,260
all up click on the bottom and you reach

633
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:57,610
somewhere let's say around two weeks

634
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,590
that by the way is already really good

635
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:03,129
right as we said before now you bought

636
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:04,810
yourself two weeks time to do detection

637
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:06,850
into the incident response

638
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:09,820
that's luxury I mean most people will

639
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:12,730
never reach two weeks even though most

640
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:15,639
tests came back completely devastating

641
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:18,400
right so just before because your pen

642
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:20,950
test comes back devastating doesn't mean

643
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,020
that this company is insecure right in

644
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:25,360
the end-to-end perspective this is one

645
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:27,940
puzzle piece one component of the

646
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,419
meantime to breach and if that overall

647
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:33,210
is anywhere four days or longer that

648
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:35,560
company has a chance of finding and

649
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:40,780
deflecting almost all hacking attacks

650
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:43,090
right now why do why do we as a

651
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:46,450
community don't live that more why are

652
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:48,129
we always asking for extremes why do we

653
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:51,700
always think that we need to protect

654
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:53,830
others right like the police officer in

655
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,600
this picture and I hired a big team in

656
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:57,280
India and most of them thought of

657
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,889
themselves more as as you know the

658
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:02,050
Bollywood police officer rather than you

659
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:04,840
know an advise on the company but

660
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:06,820
looking at it from the outside the

661
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:09,429
attitude that we often project into

662
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:12,370
organizations is what people call the

663
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:14,110
Department of no whenever they come was

664
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:16,000
a question to us can I use this

665
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:17,949
technology can ii police approve this

666
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,650
can have access to this the answers

667
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:24,370
always no we only ever see the negative

668
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:27,190
and people ridicule us for it just like

669
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:29,739
we ridicule other security people like

670
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:32,050
at the airport right they come up with

671
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:35,770
arbitrary rules that they enforce

672
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:37,210
sloppily to no measurable effect but I

673
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:38,410
feel like the greatest people in the

674
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:40,360
world and so do we

675
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:42,850
miss treating other people in our

676
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:45,040
organizations right so we are the

677
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:49,300
Department of no and people make fun of

678
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:52,418
us because we are stuck in a mindset

679
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:58,059
where we think our mission

680
00:28:52,419 --> 00:28:59,710
is to prevent hacking losses do y'all

681
00:28:58,059 --> 00:29:02,080
think that our mission is to prevent

682
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:05,200
hacking losses I thought that just a few

683
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,999
years ago I thought that so today I

684
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,679
don't think that anymore but so the

685
00:29:06,999 --> 00:29:10,779
thinking about hacking losses is

686
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:14,799
basically give money to the security

687
00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:17,289
team so you don't lose more money to the

688
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:21,100
hacker it's a positive business case

689
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:23,649
invest a little to save a lot and that

690
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:25,480
can never be true if banks spend

691
00:29:23,649 --> 00:29:28,119
hundreds of millions of dollars on

692
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,879
security how could that possibly lose

693
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:33,449
that much in fact there's the easy way

694
00:29:30,879 --> 00:29:35,918
to show this and this is cyber insurance

695
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:38,409
how much do you have to pay to an

696
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,859
insurance company for them to pay for

697
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:44,859
all your hacking losses it's never

698
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:47,109
hundreds of millions of dollars right so

699
00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:50,590
there must be some other reason why

700
00:29:47,109 --> 00:29:52,928
people invest into security that isn't

701
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:56,350
so much around preventing hacking losses

702
00:29:52,929 --> 00:29:58,869
and what is that as a reason that other

703
00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:02,199
reason is the future of every single

704
00:29:58,869 --> 00:30:05,320
company that is not a monopoly so the

705
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:09,669
future of almost every company and that

706
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:15,428
is innovation security is a support

707
00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:17,609
function of innovation we are supposed

708
00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:20,609
to find this golden middle where we

709
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:23,499
don't air on either of the two extremes

710
00:30:20,609 --> 00:30:26,320
the high extreme being the Department of

711
00:30:23,499 --> 00:30:29,049
no you come to me asking whether you can

712
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,029
launch a new mobile application no too

713
00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:33,789
risky you ask me whether you can use an

714
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:35,859
American cloud service no too risky you

715
00:30:33,789 --> 00:30:37,989
asked me whether people allowed to work

716
00:30:35,859 --> 00:30:40,149
from home no too risky

717
00:30:37,989 --> 00:30:43,600
all from a security perspective right

718
00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:45,100
you make sure that no happy person works

719
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,189
at this company on any interesting

720
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:51,158
project all right that is a possible

721
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:53,200
effect of security right and that's what

722
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:55,629
we need to prevent but also we need to

723
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,659
prevent erring on the other extreme but

724
00:30:55,629 --> 00:31:01,469
we tell people do whatever you want go

725
00:30:58,659 --> 00:31:04,239
out in the internet and get slaughtered

726
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:05,830
because there will right you let

727
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:08,380
somebody innovate compose

728
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:10,600
uncontrolled there will get slaughtered

729
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:12,190
old many of them will never want to

730
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,439
innovate again they basically burn their

731
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:18,429
fingers and shy away from innovation so

732
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:22,960
forth so it's our job to put guard rails

733
00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:26,080
around innovation to guide people away

734
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,029
from danger zones but other than keeping

735
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,269
away from danger let them do whatever

736
00:31:28,029 --> 00:31:33,039
the hell they want right I was in a

737
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:34,870
situation where I had to let them do

738
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:37,269
whatever they wanted we were working on

739
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:40,629
400 applications all at the same time

740
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:43,419
can a pen test all of them no way we

741
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:45,940
were deploying infrastructure in 200,000

742
00:31:43,419 --> 00:31:48,070
physical locations can I assure the

743
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:50,919
physical safety and security of all of

744
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:53,080
them no way right I had to let people do

745
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:55,899
whatever they wanted and nothing bad

746
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:57,850
came from it was I had to approach this

747
00:31:55,899 --> 00:31:59,979
relationship as an adviser giving them

748
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:02,110
advice when I wanted to and letting them

749
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:03,909
innovate otherwise they asked me for

750
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:08,678
guardrails I put guard rails up there

751
00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:11,380
and in other areas of life we adopt this

752
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:13,750
much more dynamic much more open risk

753
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:17,470
management for a long time already

754
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:20,200
for instance when raising children if

755
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:21,880
you approach raising your children with

756
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:25,210
the mindset of a typical security

757
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:27,880
officer you'd have to keep all risks

758
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:31,029
away from them right so you know okay

759
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:34,120
there's a safe room no sharp object that

760
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:34,919
kid has to stay in that room all the

761
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,719
time

762
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:40,809
you know there's certain certified

763
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:45,039
approved foods right you serve that same

764
00:32:40,809 --> 00:32:47,320
food to that kid every single day to

765
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:51,429
keep a kid secure you'd have to put them

766
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:54,428
in prison and that is what we do with

767
00:32:51,429 --> 00:32:56,710
our companies we imprison anybody who

768
00:32:54,429 --> 00:33:00,399
wants to do innovation by having them

769
00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:03,250
consume pre-approve technology under our

770
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:06,189
rules right now how should we approach

771
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:07,570
it how do we approach child raising we

772
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:10,059
tell the kids of course you can leave

773
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:12,760
your room you can go play outside but

774
00:33:10,059 --> 00:33:15,730
here's some guardrails not at night and

775
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:18,220
not close to the street we keep them

776
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:19,040
away from danger zones and other than

777
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:23,240
that let

778
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:26,300
explored world to become self determined

779
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:30,020
happy individuals just like it's our

780
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:32,260
responsibility to let innovative teams

781
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:36,770
that our company explore the world

782
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:38,660
attract happy new employees and create

783
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:41,270
something that nobody else has thought

784
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:44,150
of before especially not to secure the

785
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:46,790
team right so it really is our

786
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:50,960
responsibility to guide companies in

787
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:54,399
innovation so what we have to to have as

788
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:57,410
a mission is to prevent the negative

789
00:33:54,400 --> 00:34:02,210
psychology of getting hacked because

790
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:05,300
that spreads fear and that impacts the

791
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:07,610
future of our company that was so much

792
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:11,239
more than hacking losses so our mission

793
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:14,089
is to prevent the psychology of hacking

794
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:15,620
not the hacking losses that's what

795
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:17,660
insurance is for let the insurance

796
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:19,339
company pay for the hacking losses it

797
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:23,719
really doesn't matter in the big picture

798
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:26,390
right and if we can all agree to do that

799
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:27,859
then things like a Geo can happen where

800
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:30,668
this individual I asked you earlier

801
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:33,590
who's who's going to digitize allows for

802
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:36,199
faster this individual on your right who

803
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:38,960
might not even have a phone right now he

804
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:40,939
walks into geo store he puts down the

805
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,980
equivalent of ten years dollars for a

806
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:44,150
subsidized Android phone he puts down

807
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,699
his fingerprint

808
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:48,290
we suck all of his data from the

809
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:50,870
government database fill out his

810
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:54,320
contracts he signed was his fingerprint

811
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:56,480
he walks out five minutes later was a 4G

812
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,920
SIM card with a world of applications

813
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:03,080
installed in his phone for communication

814
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:06,770
information education for himself and

815
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:09,319
his kids right ten dollars and five

816
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:10,970
minutes later he's ahead of this lady in

817
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,880
the digital game and he'll always stay

818
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:17,350
ahead because he's not tied down by

819
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:20,720
legacy technology she will continue to

820
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:22,009
copy sixteen digit numbers from plastic

821
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,839
cards into her computer

822
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:27,250
he will never even know what a credit

823
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:29,660
card is she will continue to use a

824
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:31,520
thousand-year-old security technology

825
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,600
called passwords type that into a

826
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,430
computer he

827
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:37,240
again does not know what it is he has a

828
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:40,279
fingerprint and that is all he needs

829
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:42,680
this person as ahead of us in the

830
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:45,890
digital game if he wants to five minutes

831
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:49,609
later and so accompanies that adopt this

832
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:52,670
mindset so a whole society's heard of

833
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:55,490
this mindset now we won't bring about

834
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:57,530
the innovation as security people but we

835
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:59,209
can make damn sure that we are not

836
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:01,790
standing in a way of innovation that I

837
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:06,200
was treat our companies was the respect

838
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:08,720
that parents give their kids right and I

839
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:10,819
hope if if all you take away from this

840
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,919
today is don't stand in a way of

841
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:17,990
innovation then I've done my job today

842
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:20,960
right so in summary we're tied down by

843
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:22,100
legacy and everybody yes there is no

844
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,130
security by design

845
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:27,259
everybody is insecure and as a negative

846
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:29,300
way to look at this and say the world is

847
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:32,210
over and as a positive way to look at it

848
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:35,600
and that is if everybody is insecure and

849
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:37,970
it can't be that bad to be insecure we

850
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:40,250
don't need to be perfectly secure for

851
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:41,990
days that's enough as long as we get our

852
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:44,750
detection and response capabilities

853
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:47,870
under control right and let's take those

854
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:51,140
inside let's take this new freedom to

855
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:55,000
take risks and let's start treating

856
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:58,640
companies like children let's be proud

857
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:01,770
parents rather than ridiculed airport

858
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:06,430
security officers thank you very much

859
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:09,500
[Applause]

860
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:09,500
[Music]

861
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:25,259
questions no questions you have to bribe

862
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:25,259
you with t-shirts okay

863
00:37:25,499 --> 00:37:33,808
now hi thank you for this presentation

864
00:37:29,969 --> 00:37:36,849
so you said about security people have

865
00:37:33,809 --> 00:37:39,849
responsibility to help innovate and act

866
00:37:36,849 --> 00:37:43,660
like protective parents yeah instead of

867
00:37:39,849 --> 00:37:46,150
security guys but what to do with

868
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:49,239
security companies who had a bit

869
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:52,689
different approach so I had a recent

870
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:56,049
case when one security guys approached

871
00:37:52,689 --> 00:37:58,899
her company our director and they

872
00:37:56,049 --> 00:38:04,869
actually offered to make a penetration

873
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:06,910
testing so okay he of course he came to

874
00:38:04,869 --> 00:38:09,339
our department yeah with the sound

875
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:12,939
strange Christian year which was

876
00:38:09,339 --> 00:38:15,549
basically the whole recon stage it was

877
00:38:12,939 --> 00:38:18,879
like what kind of emails you using what

878
00:38:15,549 --> 00:38:21,729
kind of IP open ports blah blah and it

879
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,789
was like you know the a bit strange here

880
00:38:21,729 --> 00:38:28,658
because you usually don't do like that

881
00:38:24,789 --> 00:38:31,269
way yeah so this just change from a from

882
00:38:28,659 --> 00:38:33,609
a compliance and a negative mindset to

883
00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:35,890
this open innovation mindset that won't

884
00:38:33,609 --> 00:38:38,890
come overnight they'll still be people

885
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:40,949
who ask for just a pen test on one

886
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:43,598
application and that's all they want but

887
00:38:40,949 --> 00:38:46,659
then I think it's our responsibility to

888
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:49,269
put our results in context not to say oh

889
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:50,859
we have two medium criticality findings

890
00:38:49,269 --> 00:38:54,038
here you must not launch this mobile

891
00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:56,469
application rather to say we found two

892
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:59,619
of two bucks in your application which

893
00:38:56,469 --> 00:39:01,779
makes your application better than 95 of

894
00:38:59,619 --> 00:39:03,759
the percent of the applications already

895
00:39:01,779 --> 00:39:06,219
out there it's safe for you to launch

896
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:08,739
but next time you do an update maybe fix

897
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:10,779
those two things I think that context

898
00:39:08,739 --> 00:39:12,249
utilization a company can't do

899
00:39:10,779 --> 00:39:14,330
themselves because they don't see

900
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:17,850
hundred applications we can

901
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:20,730
but actually it was only half of Astoria

902
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:23,100
because later on this guy's approached

903
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:27,200
like physically shows some presentation

904
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:28,890
okay so since we have a office

905
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,410
infrastructure and some remote

906
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:34,500
infrastructure is quite critical we

907
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:36,720
offered them okay let's do pen tests

908
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:40,230
from the very beginning you penetrate

909
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:43,080
outer layer sit in the office yeah and

910
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:47,040
then you try to penetrate remote yeah

911
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:51,000
and they say no so they said sorry they

912
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:53,100
said okay we can do like let's pretend

913
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,450
we already penetrated everything and sit

914
00:39:53,100 --> 00:40:00,180
inside so testing like you're describing

915
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:02,189
I think can be done better but it's not

916
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:04,529
actually the core of the problem what

917
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:07,170
I'm criticizing and what I've learned to

918
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:10,380
do better is not a testing part but the

919
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:13,380
security control spot where I'll give

920
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:15,270
you one example I started in India and I

921
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:16,740
had just gotten my mandate to build my

922
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:18,509
own security team so I'd kind of

923
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:20,459
inherited all the security rules from

924
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:22,950
another company our parent company right

925
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:24,900
and so the first thing they asked me to

926
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:26,970
do is or we're launching this Dropbox

927
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,710
alternative can you please make it

928
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:31,529
secure okay

929
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:32,910
I'll look at it I'm like I refuse to

930
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:34,830
even touch this application it's

931
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:37,170
unusable I'm not talking about secured

932
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:39,049
it's just unusable guys just look at how

933
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:42,720
Dropbox does it implement all of this

934
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:44,460
they say sorry our corporate firewall

935
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:47,160
blocks any connections to Dropbox we

936
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:49,950
have never seen it right see that is a

937
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:51,990
clear case of where and control is

938
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:54,600
stifling innovation and very obvious

939
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:56,609
indirect way right so it's not so much

940
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:58,980
the security testing around it's the

941
00:40:56,610 --> 00:41:02,160
fact that this application will never be

942
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:05,820
good because somebody for DLP or

943
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,560
whatever reasons prevents our employees

944
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,850
from accessing Dropbox and Gmail and

945
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,620
whatever else right

946
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:13,319
it's those problems we need to target

947
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:14,819
first and probably you're not making

948
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,950
those decisions but it sounds like maybe

949
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:19,250
they asked you for advice sometimes so

950
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:22,649
tell them how ridiculous it is to try to

951
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:24,120
moderate innovation it will happen you

952
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:26,490
get to choose whether it happens at your

953
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:28,078
company or at some innovative tech

954
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:30,538
startup in Silicon Valley

955
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:31,979
or Shanghai right that is your choice

956
00:41:30,539 --> 00:41:40,400
and that's your only choice

957
00:41:31,979 --> 00:41:40,399
then alright thank you thanks one more

958
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:45,319
gentleman over here

959
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,310
[Music]

960
00:41:54,989 --> 00:42:03,719
your mission in security to have a

961
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:10,379
mission in security yes you say in

962
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:16,950
presentation you think compliance close

963
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:23,190
and they say yes more than ever the

964
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:29,759
paper you see yes somewhere if I get two

965
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:31,739
switches on okay once again please in

966
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:35,160
your presentation you said that before

967
00:42:31,739 --> 00:42:39,900
you were thinking that your mission in

968
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:42,390
security is to support compliance and do

969
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:44,969
everything secure but then you stepped

970
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:47,940
away from that idea what is now what is

971
00:42:44,969 --> 00:42:54,059
now your idea of your now current

972
00:42:47,940 --> 00:43:00,089
mission of security I think the main

973
00:42:54,059 --> 00:43:02,459
mission is to keep companies seek you

974
00:43:00,089 --> 00:43:05,400
enough so people love technology and

975
00:43:02,459 --> 00:43:07,019
love innovation and every time you get

976
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,479
hacked you lose your appetite for

977
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:12,479
innovation that's our main mission right

978
00:43:09,479 --> 00:43:15,029
how do I practically do this I'm

979
00:43:12,479 --> 00:43:16,948
measuring the security all the time we

980
00:43:15,029 --> 00:43:18,180
talked about the mean time to breach we

981
00:43:16,949 --> 00:43:19,890
didn't have enough time to talk about

982
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:22,229
these other numbers but those three

983
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:24,390
numbers I always have in my head and if

984
00:43:22,229 --> 00:43:27,689
anybody comes to me with an idea they

985
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:30,690
say let's block Dropbox at our firewall

986
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:33,390
for instance I asked them which of these

987
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:35,989
three numbers does this improve does it

988
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:38,879
make it harder to hack our systems no

989
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:41,500
does it make it easier to detect threats

990
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:45,640
no does it make it easier to respond

991
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:48,340
No okay that idea is dead right it's a

992
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:50,950
selection criteria for me to pick

993
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:53,470
security measures that actually work and

994
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:55,600
focus all my attention on those and as

995
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:57,669
you're measuring the mean time to breach

996
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:59,920
the detection coverage and so forth the

997
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:02,170
measuring itself tells you what you're

998
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,060
supposed to do every single red team

999
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:06,670
exercise that comes back we're saying

1000
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:09,190
you know I hacked you in four days they

1001
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:11,200
tell you how the heck you use that

1002
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:14,380
information do something with it and

1003
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:16,419
don't try to do I don't know don't try

1004
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:19,060
to be quantum resistant in your

1005
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:22,570
cryptography until a red teamer has a

1006
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:26,020
quantum computer don't try to prevent

1007
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:27,970
any possible negative outcome that has

1008
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:30,210
never happened to you that has never

1009
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:32,080
happened anywhere else on the world

1010
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:35,740
defense-in-depth security by design

1011
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:37,660
right we have obvious legacy issues that

1012
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:40,569
we can be addressing today we have

1013
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:43,210
default passwords bat hardening missing

1014
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:45,400
patches and the red teamers tell us

1015
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:47,800
every single time that do an exercise

1016
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,310
that's the topics we need to be working

1017
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,990
on

1018
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:53,049
that's the topics where everybody agrees

1019
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:55,709
we're creating values let's not worry

1020
00:44:53,050 --> 00:45:01,000
about what will happen in ten years

1021
00:44:55,710 --> 00:45:03,070
yeah that's right other questions even

1022
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,400
with no t-shirt sorry I ran out yeah one

1023
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:05,400
over there

1024
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:18,950
hi health sync today many innovations

1025
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:23,190
are concentrated in software development

1026
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:27,319
but according to your reports it's one

1027
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:33,180
of most vulnerable industries why I

1028
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:35,700
thought the developers know something

1029
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:38,609
about security more than other

1030
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:42,750
industries yeah

1031
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:44,970
that is a good question and that I think

1032
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:47,220
is you're pointing out a big lever that

1033
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:50,129
we still have so there are companies who

1034
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:53,220
know how to work with technology they

1035
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:55,320
have no excuse right but they are

1036
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:56,730
driving innovation to a point where they

1037
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,740
do something new and you and you all the

1038
00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:00,540
time what they don't segregate the

1039
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:02,009
environments well where they don't have

1040
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:03,660
you know second and third factor

1041
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:05,100
authentication where they just want

1042
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:08,549
everything on the internet easy to

1043
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:11,279
access and they'll do that just purely

1044
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:12,780
even illusionary to the point where then

1045
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,340
they get hacked and they're shy away and

1046
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:17,130
do it a little bit better so I think

1047
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:20,880
software companies in some way to look

1048
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:22,320
at it ah I have to secure the level that

1049
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,870
if everybody were making rational

1050
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:28,950
choices everybody would have right a

1051
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:31,529
secure a software company can die if

1052
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:34,589
they're not innovative enough they don't

1053
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:36,990
usually die if they get hacked right so

1054
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:38,580
you you have more and more innovative

1055
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:40,290
companies in that field because it's

1056
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:42,110
such quick turnaround

1057
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:46,380
can we still help them get better

1058
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:49,500
absolutely but it must come as light

1059
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:52,560
touch approach so continuing this

1060
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:54,150
Dropbox example right I told the people

1061
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,040
in India I want to get rid of all of

1062
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:58,260
these firewall rules that say you can't

1063
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:00,420
access Dropbox Gmail and so forth and

1064
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:02,400
said but then people will move all our

1065
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:05,850
secrets to the service and say no I'll

1066
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:08,420
hire six people 24/7 monitoring of all

1067
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:10,920
internet connections and if anybody ever

1068
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:14,370
uploads more than let's say 100 megabyte

1069
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:17,400
I'll go then speak wisdom right so now

1070
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:20,790
you replace a free firewall rule with

1071
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,240
six people plus a big data and analytics

1072
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:22,200
engine

1073
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,868
I spent a lot

1074
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:27,180
more how could I convince them to spend

1075
00:47:24,869 --> 00:47:30,420
a lot more by saying you now have a

1076
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:32,129
future again I'm spending the money you

1077
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:34,530
will earn two years from now I'm

1078
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:38,130
spending that today on innovation and I

1079
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:40,170
think was that rationale we can help any

1080
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:42,270
kind of company especially technology

1081
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:45,150
heavy companies by saying we're willing

1082
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:49,130
to invest more if the control is lighter

1083
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:51,660
touch right again let innovation happen

1084
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:55,260
that's why I'm asking you to do does not

1085
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:57,240
mean don't do anything do all the things

1086
00:47:55,260 --> 00:48:01,079
you can do was outstanding in somebody

1087
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:03,720
else's way I do monitoring do Incident

1088
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:06,210
Response do whatever pentesting you want

1089
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:08,399
but don't make it at all gate let them

1090
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:10,349
launch whatever they want and as soon as

1091
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,970
they download it from the App Store do

1092
00:48:10,349 --> 00:48:14,670
your tests and then tell them whatever

1093
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:17,700
mistakes they made might be light touch

1094
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:19,560
but be focused on what matters as

1095
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:23,310
measured by the mean time to breach as

1096
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:23,520
measured by your own retinas okay thank

1097
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:27,089
you

1098
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:28,579
Thanks I don't have the time there's no

1099
00:48:27,089 --> 00:48:31,680
time for questions

1100
00:48:28,579 --> 00:48:35,510
yeah the question over here in the front

1101
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:35,509
row all the way at the end

1102
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:46,200
greetings thanks again for presentation

1103
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:48,480
I have small question based on the

1104
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:51,270
experience in your attention you told

1105
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:55,080
something about weak infrastructure and

1106
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:57,930
some time about mean time to breach and

1107
00:48:55,080 --> 00:49:00,660
mean time to recovery so about the

1108
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:05,279
experience which best fails you see in

1109
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:06,870
your work which not call it but NJ what

1110
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,960
best values don't see what what's the

1111
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:11,580
best well is for time to breach and time

1112
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,710
to recovery yeah so if you want to be

1113
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:15,180
brilliant in security your mean time to

1114
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:18,180
breach will be something around two

1115
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:22,169
weeks your detection coverage will be

1116
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:24,480
around 70% and by that I mean 70% of

1117
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:26,910
standard hacking techniques you detect

1118
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:29,400
and it mean time to respond yeah you

1119
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:31,470
don't really get below 24 hours even if

1120
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:33,120
people start right away usually they

1121
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:34,470
don't really understand what got hacked

1122
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:37,799
the first have to read up on it they

1123
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:38,189
have to wake up some people right so two

1124
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:41,790
weeks

1125
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:44,220
70% 24 hours if you can reach that know

1126
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:46,110
hackers interested in you anymore it's

1127
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:48,930
just stupid joke you know when you're

1128
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:51,390
running away from the bear and you think

1129
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:53,339
am I gonna be faster than the bear as a

1130
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:55,680
wrong question Emma gonna be faster than

1131
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:58,730
the other person running next to me who

1132
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:00,509
to the bear is equally delicious right

1133
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:03,480
nobody needs to be hundred percent

1134
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:05,670
anything in security as long as there is

1135
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:08,850
a slower person running next to you that

1136
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:11,130
looks equally delicious right yeah

1137
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:13,230
understand well for security you need to

1138
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:15,600
be more faster than attackers yet but I

1139
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:18,390
want to know how many companies you see

1140
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:20,970
who is this level of security in York

1141
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:22,770
and I mean either skewed view when we

1142
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:24,600
are done with our services all of them

1143
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:27,030
right that that that is the services

1144
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,509
that I'm selling right when we started a

1145
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:29,250
company

1146
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:31,290
none of them that's why they're buying

1147
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:33,270
our services so I can't really give you

1148
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:35,430
a good statistic on that right I

1149
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:42,360
understand thank you thanks good

1150
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:43,950
questions yeah anything else okay

1151
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:46,650
I'll be around of course for the rest of

1152
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:47,310
today and tomorrow don't give me too

1153
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:49,890
much vodka

1154
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:53,480
I remember my last pH days it'll only

1155
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:54,020
half of each day yeah so thanks again

1156
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:57,170
[Music]

1157
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:57,170
[Applause]
