1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:10,590
it's 5:00 bus 1 let's wait for a few

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:14,700
more minutes to wait whether people come

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:27,619
back to wait for the people to come back

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:30,689
and while we are waiting we will still

5
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:33,239
be starting our presentations I will

6
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,500
have to apologize for the that I will

7
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,959
have to make my presentation well

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,200
sitting first of all I'd like to thank

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,570
the organizers served for the

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:47,120
opportunity to discuss humanitarian

11
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:51,469
issues of the global informatization and

12
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:55,050
digitization even though the forum is

13
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:58,140
related to technocratic issues we know

14
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:03,000
that software and hardware are in not

15
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:10,619
the end goal they are not an end in

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:15,659
itself and the need for these systems is

17
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:20,039
defined by the need of the is defined by

18
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:23,310
the need of the people and one house

19
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,479
given a remark we are going to have two

20
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,479
hours for discussions

21
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:33,038
there's the fact that we have five

22
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:37,840
speakers each speakers will have 20

23
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:39,490
minutes so for the presentation and for

24
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:45,310
two or three questions from the audience

25
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:50,140
if we make this time we will have 15 to

26
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:57,219
20 minutes to answer questions related

27
00:01:50,140 --> 00:02:01,379
to the topic overall let's start our

28
00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:03,788
room table is called dis of formation

29
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:08,500
transition from the from a knowledge

30
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:14,260
economy into a digital nation or digital

31
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:17,769
government let's discuss what it is Kyle

32
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:20,679
Bosch needn't his presentation called

33
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:22,120
from global digitization to new

34
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:26,109
civilization yes

35
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:32,470
all right here lifted the lid on this

36
00:02:26,109 --> 00:02:40,540
topic the knowledge economy and they

37
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:44,160
need before a new system these changes

38
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:48,819
are so radical that are hard to imagine

39
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,380
how do we adapt the existing capitalist

40
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:54,190
system to the changes that have occurred

41
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:58,959
they require a change in places here is

42
00:02:54,190 --> 00:03:03,459
hearing constants of capitalism so of

43
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:08,430
what are the changes that lie ahead of

44
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:11,310
us when it comes to politics economics

45
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:14,489
who can understand and embrace your

46
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:20,120
reality the rules of the game and that

47
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:26,730
you digital society who is the subject

48
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:30,390
how the subjects of this new of this new

49
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:32,220
reality not going to act so before we

50
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:35,939
discuss these issues we need to do the

51
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:38,640
following we need to take the different

52
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:41,849
local net information from the point of

53
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:49,980
your philosophy second we have to

54
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:56,608
rethink the methods in the economy of T

55
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:59,578
and we have to change we have to rethink

56
00:03:56,609 --> 00:04:06,540
the status of philosophy and we have to

57
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:10,019
figure out what part of society claims

58
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,638
the roles of the leader that will take

59
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:14,549
the society forward and the last

60
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:17,880
question yes what are the elite of the

61
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:20,849
creative class capable of not only

62
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:24,599
ensure the development of the city but

63
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:28,380
risk that also retain their cultural

64
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:30,960
heritage that's a question that doesn't

65
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:38,639
seem to be related so the digital

66
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:40,710
underground speakers if they do not

67
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,800
answer this question perhaps they will

68
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:46,440
be able to better formulate the

69
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,630
questions that need to be considered

70
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,490
going forward

71
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:52,170
even though the materials of the

72
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:55,160
conflict in the materials of the

73
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:57,630

patents and the authors of different

121
00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:45,039
inventions we have not been able to

122
00:07:43,179 --> 00:07:52,899
highlight the three different topics we

123
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:58,360
have not been able to have not been able

124
00:07:52,899 --> 00:08:01,269
to see many presenters that were to have

125
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,769
promised to participate so we will be

126
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:10,229
talking about the psychiatry psychology

127
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:10,229
in an age of economy of knowledge

128
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:23,990
give the fact that we are limited for

129
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:25,789
time I'm going to spend 15 minutes so

130
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,650
I'm going to be talking about in you

131
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:33,130
relations in the economy of knowledge

132
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:33,130
no based economy but first so let's

133
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,990
let me take a short break

134
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:53,120
it's development if your vanity has gone

135
00:08:51,030 --> 00:09:04,350
through different stages of formation

136
00:08:53,120 --> 00:09:12,930
the capitalist feudal and slavery stages

137
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:17,060
and this led to different systems of

138
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:19,890
society and the part of society that

139
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:24,329
according technologies in became the

140
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:28,020
leader and it has to be mentioned that

141
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:30,540
the exchange of these social formations

142
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:34,340
is directly dependent on the job

143
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:39,480
production means and technologies and

144
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:46,380
following you following teach radical

145
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:51,780
changes in the worldview of new social

146
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:57,120
formations appeared Einstein's theory

147
00:09:51,780 --> 00:10:01,380
all of us chefs key theory so if the

148
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,060
first example is not very bright because

149
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,930
it mostly affected fundamental

150
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:08,849
mathematics basic mathematics the second

151
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:11,670
example is more representative too

152
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:17,160
because it led to many products lasers

153
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:19,170
and LEDs communication systems in other

154
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,920
words to the creation of modern

155
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:26,000
information technologies then as a

156
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:28,579
result we come to the conclusion

157
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,360
I begin to understand the key role of

158
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:38,540
science intelligently and how to

159
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:42,410
practically use this knowledge as a

160
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:47,149
major factor of transformation in modern

161
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:50,870
society so we will continue the

162
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:53,420
discussion of our topic further now

163
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:59,379
let's consider the key aspects of the

164
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:59,378
joj that were called a digitization

165
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:04,639
information based society the first

166
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,930
question is of what is information do we

167
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:12,490
understand this term and here lies the

168
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:18,529
most important thing the fast

169
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:21,110
distribution of software philosophy is

170
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:25,120
no longer the basis for the development

171
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:29,649
of new knowledge but an outsider

172
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:32,300
moreover modern philosophers have

173
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:34,790
essentially missed the emergence of

174
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:38,209
history reality and so twenty years ago

175
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:42,050
old channel floridian such as the dead

176
00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:46,268
creation the philosophy of information

177
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:52,758
that is important to mention here that

178
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:54,879
we have had two main branches of

179
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:54,879
philosophy

180
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,450
Sokratis philosophy and antique

181
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:04,780
philosophy and now we have a third

182
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:07,240
fundamental branch of philosophy the

183
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:13,780
philosopher formation that's going to

184
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:16,960
help us understand what it is now let's

185
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:26,770
discuss the philosophy of information

186
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:30,390
based on existence the Bible says in the

187
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:39,430
beginning was the word and the word was

188
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:42,449
God because he said and it became so in

189
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:48,040
the beginning was the word and modern

190
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:51,390
modern physics believes that the bank

191
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:55,810
Big Bang Theory is correct and that is

192
00:12:51,390 --> 00:13:01,510
very closely related to the existence of

193
00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:11,829
some primal entity perhaps this was the

194
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:21,189
word now let's consider the main subject

195
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:25,240
of our research the human is not just a

196
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:30,630
source of physical force it is a source

197
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:35,380
of new knowledge means of manufacture

198
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:38,580
based on intelligence and a human is no

199
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,580
longer a passive

200
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:49,250
don't wear Oh creator he is an active

201
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:51,260
creator of intellectual products that

202
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:53,630
means that there are new points of

203
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:57,040
growth and healing to run many new of

204
00:13:53,630 --> 00:14:01,640
manufacturing forces he that

205
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:06,439
significantly affect the development of

206
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:08,480
society your rules are safety your

207
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,750
social relation society in other words

208
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:16,360
the rules by which the society society

209
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:23,990
lives another important aspect is the

210
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:27,410
psychiatric sanity the development is

211
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:31,160
big development is becoming more and

212
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:35,000
more important in technique here is why

213
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:38,029
is the most important thing in fact the

214
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,160
concretist the greatest breakthroughs in

215
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:43,720
science were made by geniuses in

216
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:52,850
geniuses were not entirely sane

217
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:54,620
many of them many of them towards the

218
00:14:52,850 --> 00:15:03,640
end of their lives became completely

219
00:14:54,620 --> 00:15:09,850
insane and this raises a lot of issues

220
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:09,850
such as intellectual property ownership

221
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:18,430
and we're talking about

222
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:21,970
turns hundreds of billions of dollars we

223
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:27,699
know how highly it actual prophecy is

224
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:31,300
valued patterns know how and so on so

225
00:15:27,699 --> 00:15:33,639
the risks are colossal and another

226
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:42,550
resistor to have to consider is the

227
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:46,600
external influence upon the human beings

228
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:49,750
and these are completely new challenges

229
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:54,449
for society in a knowledge-based economy

230
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:57,399
and this has to be taken into account

231
00:15:54,449 --> 00:16:00,339
given these the complexity of these

232
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:05,379
changes let's see how we can get

233
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:13,899
ourselves oriented how we can control

234
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:17,319
this process who is going to lead these

235
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:21,250
changes who is later the creative but

236
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:24,670
seems to be the leader as simple doesn't

237
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:29,160
use the first integrated power but

238
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:33,779
horizontal in which creativity takes

239
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:37,389
precedence over everything else and

240
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:43,930
since every society is broken down into

241
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:46,779
groups in which people form their

242
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:52,319
allegiances sometimes based on need and

243
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:52,319
based on values

244
00:16:58,489 --> 00:17:06,600
since the alias of well comprised

245
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:10,799
different nationalities members of

246
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:12,480
different religious groups how these

247
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:15,388
interests are gonna be balanced we don't

248
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:20,669
know Alexandre chorin skier has

249
00:17:15,388 --> 00:17:24,750
addressed these issues in 12 his races

250
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:31,649
of humanity and other works and these

251
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:35,899
works are show a link between nature and

252
00:17:31,649 --> 00:17:41,668
psychology socialization and a dresser

253
00:17:35,899 --> 00:17:44,299
and a small plug if the small break that

254
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:44,299
I'd like to make

255
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:56,580
now as mathematicians soon after

256
00:17:54,659 --> 00:18:02,099
discussing initial condition so letís

257
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:05,090
discuss the main topic what are the key

258
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:10,168
principles in a knowledge-based economy

259
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:12,629
let's discuss the specifics first non

260
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:16,710
material products are non tangible

261
00:18:12,629 --> 00:18:20,340
products and services that can be

262
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:22,830
transformed into non tangible assets the

263
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:27,238
next part is that it is important to

264
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:29,908
mention that the manufacturing means the

265
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:37,889
fact are owned by physical persons on

266
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:45,720
computers printers automated lead in

267
00:18:37,889 --> 00:18:51,330
development relation between subjects of

268
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:54,029
the economic relations these dealings

269
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:59,099
between these subjects can will be

270
00:18:54,029 --> 00:19:03,440
completely virtual so the specific of

271
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:03,439
economic activities of an economic

272
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:15,710
digital government is the focus on a

273
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:18,299
virtual that's the first principle of

274
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:21,419
political and socio-economic relations

275
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:24,139
in a knowledge economy the second

276
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:26,000
principles the new system of values to

277
00:19:24,139 --> 00:19:27,800
better

278
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,680
better understand this I'd like to ask

279
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:33,800
your vision question why for several

280
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:37,420
centuries Russia and the West cannot

281
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:39,770
achieve the point of a sustainable

282
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:42,740
sustainable development will have

283
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:47,590
different values ethical norms for

284
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:51,070
example in the West in the West justice

285
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:58,000
takes a back seat being compared to

286
00:19:51,070 --> 00:20:01,700
older law to power is higher than money

287
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,800
spiritual is more important material

288
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:08,090
that's our mentality

289
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:13,659
so the values that people hold depend on

290
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:17,360
manufacturers social psychological

291
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:19,130
physical factors the most important that

292
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:24,560
I would like to enjoy your attention to

293
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:29,000
is the faith and these are not empty

294
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:32,720
words so the question is how to ensure

295
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,900
that the value system in the digital

296
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:39,080
economy is adequate to the requirements

297
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:42,800
of people because this is going to be

298
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:47,860
important grow environment at the part

299
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:52,790
of society that does intellectual work

300
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:57,919
and that favors a projector rather than

301
00:20:52,790 --> 00:21:04,940
the subjective approach so we can say

302
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:08,180
that objectivity and all-round analysis

303
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:12,060
based on the methods and criteria

304
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:15,750
naturally for the scientific world will

305
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:19,980
help us avoid mistakes tip next aspect

306
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:22,860
of type of economy here we don't have to

307
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:25,260
invent in Italy because just now we have

308
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,909
started with the huge hearing constants

309
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:29,190
that exist in the capitalist all

310
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:31,950
civilized the world based on month of

311
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:35,340
principles and management what's going

312
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:37,650
to be the status quo will be restored we

313
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:42,330
will get back to natural economic

314
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:45,390
relations based on the labor theory of

315
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:49,939
value the principles that were espoused

316
00:21:45,390 --> 00:22:00,360
by sovereign Socrates and other

317
00:21:49,940 --> 00:22:05,190
disciples of his the principle of the

318
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:06,620
capitalist system is not justice based

319
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:09,750
on injustice

320
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:16,290
Aristotle discussed Asura trustus in his

321
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:20,070
works the injustice of the capitalist

322
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:23,510
system is that it's not the creation or

323
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:27,240
failure but a redistribution of

324
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:32,310
previously created values remain the

325
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:34,830
first aspect is another furniture and

326
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:39,360
constant of modern capitalism that shows

327
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:40,470
the problem modern man is fiat money

328
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,978
that

329
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:43,979
[Music]

330
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:51,030
that is different that compared to what

331
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:55,549
was before

332
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:58,950
such as gold gold had intrinsic value

333
00:22:55,549 --> 00:23:03,990
while fiat money does not have an

334
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:12,380
intrinsic value and they have felt here

335
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:15,570
only due to poor so a certain circle of

336
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:22,440
persons can get rich themselves by

337
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:29,418
printing use by creating this money they

338
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:31,880
purchased some capacity of money can be

339
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:37,559
manipulated by the government or by

340
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:42,720
monetary authorities exchange rates can

341
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:46,190
be manipulated as well so in digital so

342
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:51,000
in the digital society a three component

343
00:23:46,190 --> 00:24:00,299
money the three component Maya tree unit

344
00:23:51,000 --> 00:24:04,140
will be used reputation value there's

345
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:09,540
another branch of questions which I will

346
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:12,270
skip because I need to finish up might

347
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:18,540
life to the well on some practical

348
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:19,950
points on how a digital state concept of

349
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:22,580
the digital state concept can be

350
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,580
implemented

351
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:30,120
[Music]

352
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:34,400
what scenario is possible a system of

353
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:40,860
new personal and social relations

354
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:45,380
ideology aims related to the production

355
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:51,389
of a Georgie Sutton Hoo politic politics

356
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:53,940
and how parts of the personal

357
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:59,100
sovereignty can be delegated to the

358
00:24:53,940 --> 00:25:01,640
government next the principles of social

359
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:05,580
institutions and objective conditions

360
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:08,640
for the creation of a harmonious legal

361
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:13,789
field in which the IT infrastructure

362
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:17,010
which is twelve state can be created

363
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:18,620
after that he did logic relations with

364
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:22,350
other countries and international

365
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:27,030
institutions can be done this work is

366
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:33,899
challenging but is possible very many

367
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:42,539
countries emerged and disappeared and

368
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:44,700
this is an ongoing process and you can

369
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:48,600
find out more if you go to the website

370
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:50,730
digital formation during the

371
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,590
implementation of the project we don't

372
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:55,169
come at the conflict of it exists in

373
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:57,000
jurisdictions own countries rivers were

374
00:25:55,169 --> 00:26:00,270
created in youth subject of

375
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:04,039
international relations that is oriented

376
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:08,720
towards the production of a material

377
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:08,720
values the material value

378
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:15,539
that cannot be done in traditional

379
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:19,228
countries or organizations we don't

380
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:24,119
claim any territory and we don't claim

381
00:26:19,229 --> 00:26:26,729
to have any people and double

382
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:30,299
citizenship without other countries to

383
00:26:26,729 --> 00:26:32,009
be independent in choosing the

384
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:38,039
jurisdiction for their intellectual

385
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:41,009
changes so the digital state is an area

386
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:46,349
of unlimited possibilities thank you

387
00:26:41,009 --> 00:26:50,249
very much take into account my proposal

388
00:26:46,349 --> 00:26:52,559
is as follows to give the floor to the

389
00:26:50,249 --> 00:26:57,239
next speaker

390
00:26:52,559 --> 00:27:00,119
because we are out of time the second

391
00:26:57,239 --> 00:27:02,389
petition philosophy and world

392
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:05,478
understanding in the epoch of

393
00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:10,830
informatization is in the omission of

394
00:27:05,479 --> 00:27:13,379
Doctor of Philosophy hello in my

395
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:18,629
presentation I'm going to present a

396
00:27:13,379 --> 00:27:23,820
humanities person view of the issues

397
00:27:18,629 --> 00:27:26,279
that you may believe to be far away from

398
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:30,359
a sphere of competence but I believe

399
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:32,720
it's an absolute month's must in his

400
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:35,639
presentation the previous speaker

401
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,580
touched upon the subject he mentioned

402
00:27:35,639 --> 00:27:41,428
that it's now time to find the new

403
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:44,039
mechanism of world understanding in the

404
00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:46,999
changing world because this new world

405
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:52,289
doesn't only bring us conveniences

406
00:27:46,999 --> 00:28:00,139
convenience or bonuses so the end of the

407
00:27:52,289 --> 00:28:02,700
previous event was marked by absolute

408
00:28:00,139 --> 00:28:04,709
optimism but there are also serious

409
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:08,159
threats there are certain issues that

410
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:09,520
you need to think about absolutely if we

411
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:13,950
are to

412
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:17,230
conserve or keep life in us because our

413
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:20,410
predatory organization our civilization

414
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:22,900
has now reached a certain limits after

415
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:26,470
which there may only be a catastrophe

416
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:29,410
that's one point now about a purely

417
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:33,250
philosophical consideration or what is

418
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:36,160
information philosophy well starts from

419
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:36,880
the basics information let's take the

420
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:42,070
Latin word

421
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:44,740
it's a knowledge thinking information if

422
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:49,350
we start from the language is a kind of

423
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:52,300
linguistic program that is capable of

424
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:55,540
puts into autumn some part of reality

425
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:59,290
some knowledge the questions of shape

426
00:28:55,540 --> 00:29:03,070
and limits is a fundamental question for

427
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:05,820
modern philosophy of course now you are

428
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:11,110
away and I believe everybody knows that

429
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:13,120
the mainstream information theory it

430
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:15,149
goes back to Claude Shannon but let's

431
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:20,199
not forget so that it was proposed

432
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:22,600
immediately after World War two so it is

433
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:26,680
already quite obsolete

434
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:29,020
it's not relish and defined information

435
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:30,760
as a qualitative measure which formation

436
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:32,700
exchange doesn't matter what we're

437
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:38,320
saying some nonsense

438
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:40,450
some fake information no genius ideas it

439
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,070
would everything all of it would be

440
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:44,620
information according to him and this is

441
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:49,300
the weakest link in this theory and it's

442
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:52,360
exactly what modern information scholars

443
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:54,820
are criticizing proposing at their own

444
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:57,850
interpretation everyone takes their own

445
00:29:54,820 --> 00:30:02,980
perspective trying to avoid this

446
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:05,230
approach what I like the most in

447
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:09,690
Shannon's theory is that statement that

448
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:15,670
a false information brings more volume

449
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:18,470
than true information so this is what

450
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:20,419
all advertising ideology

451
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:24,970
based on and other things in our life as

452
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:30,110
to alternatives to Shannon's theory I

453
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:33,020
personally like the information a theory

454
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:36,500
proposed in 1980s by Verna

455
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:38,720
Akito it's a German researcher and it's

456
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:41,510
about him I'm going to say a few words

457
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:47,419
right now what he proposes as an

458
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:52,720
alternative another important point our

459
00:30:47,419 --> 00:30:56,090
society consciousness lags behind

460
00:30:52,720 --> 00:31:01,549
processes happening in the world in a

461
00:30:56,090 --> 00:31:05,709
way it's okay because human psyche or

462
00:31:01,549 --> 00:31:08,418
the collective research community and

463
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:11,600
Thomas Kuhn I wrote about it very well

464
00:31:08,419 --> 00:31:13,970
in his book on the structure of a

465
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,850
scientific revolution we're not capable

466
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:19,360
of adapting to the new reality every

467
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:23,449
five years the size of information

468
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:26,809
doubles and the human consciousness is

469
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:29,270
not adapted to these two this pace so

470
00:31:26,809 --> 00:31:31,039
there's a gap we live just like we're in

471
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:33,139
the middle of the 20th century it

472
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:37,129
touches upon everything how we consume

473
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:39,770
how our consumption Society generates no

474
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:44,510
rubbish that we throw away huge amounts

475
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:47,330
and so which will soon poison all the

476
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:50,360
nature we can't restructure cells but

477
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:53,120
the same problem exists saying the world

478
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:54,830
outlook the 20th century see especially

479
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:58,389
the second half and the start of the

480
00:31:54,830 --> 00:32:00,770
century proposed such a scientific

481
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:03,140
discovery in theories that don't match

482
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:06,110
our understanding I'm not even mentioned

483
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:07,700
in quantum physics which was proposed

484
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:09,559
more than a hundred years ago

485
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:12,890
you can remember Benoit mother dropped

486
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:15,039
genetics the human genome genome has

487
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:17,780
been decoded

488
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,908
whereas our consciousness is not yet

489
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:23,330
capable we think about a finish just as

490
00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:25,370
if it's some material value but in

491
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:29,710
actual fact let me give you just three

492
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:32,289
examples that will show that you can't

493
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:36,519
bring down information to purely

494
00:32:32,289 --> 00:32:39,549
tangible things it's something more and

495
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:44,080
what is it we have to decide so we know

496
00:32:39,549 --> 00:32:46,299
that there are such laws acting in the

497
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,279
world that we call laws of nature what

498
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:50,590
makes them different from theories and

499
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:53,830
help what is it they are in effect

500
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:56,019
always and everywhere there's

501
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:58,658
fundamental law that everyone knows is

502
00:32:56,019 --> 00:33:02,259
the second law of thermodynamics it says

503
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:05,620
that an oscillator system entropy either

504
00:33:02,259 --> 00:33:07,629
stays the same or gross a simple example

505
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:09,070
would go out of this room and then come

506
00:33:07,629 --> 00:33:13,539
back in a hundred years and what do we

507
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:15,789
see here you know dust ruin forgotten

508
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:16,389
things some sounds like as something

509
00:33:15,789 --> 00:33:18,669
goes rotten

510
00:33:16,389 --> 00:33:22,658
something is good you know rusted all

511
00:33:18,669 --> 00:33:24,460
them also if we notice that all this

512
00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:26,350
space is built of plastic and other

513
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:28,870
artificial materials that's quite sad

514
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:31,809
actually but they said our consciousness

515
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:34,570
is saying that this world you know was

516
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:36,820
created as a result of evolution but

517
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:39,309
evolution according to the second law of

518
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:42,539
thermodynamics is just impossible so

519
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:44,889
evolution there's a gradual improvements

520
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:47,169
through the growth of information

521
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:52,120
including biological information so this

522
00:33:47,169 --> 00:33:55,539
theory states that in the world chaos E

523
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:59,979
is not really growing but it's rather

524
00:33:55,539 --> 00:34:04,480
the opposite the more order is generated

525
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:07,299
but it runs contrary to the fundamental

526
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:10,569
principles of science another example

527
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:14,980
let's go back to another famous law

528
00:34:10,569 --> 00:34:16,649
based on which all industry operates the

529
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:20,679
energy conservation law

530
00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:24,310
everybody knows energy will not appear

531
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:27,069
from anywhere and it will not disappear

532
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:32,109
anywhere perhaps it's a very simplified

533
00:34:27,069 --> 00:34:36,489
way of formulating this law so this law

534
00:34:32,109 --> 00:34:39,210
of nature runs counter to the premise

535
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:46,408
that this world could

536
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:49,559
emerge on its own because imagine some

537
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:52,470
hyper powerful energy would appear at

538
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:54,270
some point in time but energy can't

539
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:57,839
appear from anywhere you need a source

540
00:34:54,270 --> 00:35:02,750
of energy so these are fundamental laws

541
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:06,058
of nature but we in our philosophical

542
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:08,990
our constructions close our eyes to it

543
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:12,800
we just can't work out a new theory and

544
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:16,319
it's something that we absolutely need

545
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:18,119
Eugene mentioned that and now we'll say

546
00:35:16,319 --> 00:35:22,980
another couple of words the third

547
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:27,089
example I already mentioned that the

548
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:29,880
human genome has been decoded almost 200

549
00:35:27,089 --> 00:35:33,750
percent so what DNA is all about as it

550
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:35,010
turned out if in the 18th century the

551
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:37,380
thought of the thinking was quite

552
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:41,849
primitive the koch's for instance was

553
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:44,940
saying that's you know animals are just

554
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:47,520
mechanisms very intricate and fine but

555
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:51,359
mechanisms now when we're looking at

556
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:55,940
what life is all about it's not possible

557
00:35:51,359 --> 00:36:00,299
because DNA is and perfect information a

558
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:02,579
accumulation system one DNA molecule has

559
00:36:00,299 --> 00:36:05,670
accumulated a huge amount of information

560
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:08,790
that you need thousands of books to

561
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:13,640
store for a chemical letters at an

562
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:19,619
inhuman citizen and though they and they

563
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:24,029
though these nucleotides are built in a

564
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:26,819
sequence but if you want to put them in

565
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:29,640
a single line this line will take you

566
00:36:26,819 --> 00:36:34,200
from the equator to the North Pole one

567
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:35,098
molecule and for a new organism to

568
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:39,859
emerge

569
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:43,559
you need all DNA's to fully replicate

570
00:36:39,859 --> 00:36:44,869
with and this is happening with a

571
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:48,289
minimum of

572
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:52,460
of errors so considering the volume

573
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:55,460
information the number of number of such

574
00:36:52,460 --> 00:37:00,980
errors is infinitesimal so the number of

575
00:36:55,460 --> 00:37:05,869
information taking part in conscious or

576
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:08,900
unconscious processes is immense if you

577
00:37:05,869 --> 00:37:11,240
compare it with the entire size of

578
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:13,549
knowledge accumulated by human kites in

579
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:16,910
all libraries in the world it turns out

580
00:37:13,549 --> 00:37:22,490
to be much larger just in a one system

581
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:25,848
in one organism if we go at the very

582
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:29,598
root of its most biological information

583
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:32,299
is encoded and available the e things

584
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:35,299
for instance are absolutely we can't

585
00:37:32,299 --> 00:37:39,009
understand them why birds navigate just

586
00:37:35,299 --> 00:37:42,730
as they do how can they know their path

587
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:46,160
crossing the whole seas and continents

588
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:48,109
all sorts of experiments were made they

589
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,089
would take them far away in the middle

590
00:37:48,109 --> 00:37:51,890
of the ocean to an absolutely different

591
00:37:50,089 --> 00:37:55,279
part of the earth and they were able to

592
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:57,739
find the place of their nesting what is

593
00:37:55,279 --> 00:38:01,549
the source of information that controls

594
00:37:57,739 --> 00:38:04,849
their flight we don't know or let's say

595
00:38:01,549 --> 00:38:09,829
the dance of the bees how some primitive

596
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:12,799
B can transmit information to all their

597
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:15,710
peers so we see the social information

598
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:18,319
we see the transmitter we see how it all

599
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:21,980
happens how it all works how they

600
00:38:18,319 --> 00:38:24,739
achieve their goals in other words we

601
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:27,319
don't see just a material a tangible

602
00:38:24,739 --> 00:38:30,499
process as a foundation of life some

603
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:34,130
things but we see that life itself runs

604
00:38:30,499 --> 00:38:42,910
based on information based on the intent

605
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:49,099
of four humongous complexity you can

606
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:54,069
recall a lot of things how and limitless

607
00:38:49,099 --> 00:38:54,069
infinite as the world of nature is

608
00:38:55,110 --> 00:39:04,600
infinite the number of enigmas the

609
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:07,890
mysteries so you can take the problem of

610
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:11,170
efficiency any engineer would dream of

611
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:18,310
achieving the same amount of energy

612
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:21,910
efficiency as living systems show before

613
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:25,090
the fundamental scientific discoveries

614
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:29,830
of 20th century it was unknown and based

615
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:32,710
on this whole body of evidence we need

616
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:35,340
to change to modify our behavior in the

617
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:39,220
world because the human behavior is

618
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:43,420
based on infinite consumption this is

619
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:46,839
our basic and fundamental strata

620
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:49,200
behavioral strategy of this planet we

621
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:51,790
continuously consume and destroy

622
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:56,109
resources and everything else in the

623
00:39:51,790 --> 00:40:00,430
modern world its achieves absolutely

624
00:39:56,110 --> 00:40:02,230
catastrophic dimensions every day about

625
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:06,220
a three species of flora and fauna

626
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:10,360
disappear so by the middle of the 21st

627
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:15,100
century we will see the disappearance of

628
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:15,490
one in every three living species in the

629
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:18,549
world

630
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:20,620
what consequences will we see that for

631
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:23,860
instance we know that in China they

632
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:26,620
destroyed all sparrows in two years ten

633
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:31,510
million people died because these

634
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:35,620
sparrows stopped killing insects and

635
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:36,460
insects destroyed the harvest so a

636
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:39,400
famine in

637
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:42,280
insureds so what will happen if this

638
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:44,890
third of life will disappear you also

639
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:47,590
have to understand that the

640
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:49,330
disappearance of life means depleting

641
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:54,130
the information and diversity in our

642
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:57,460
world and we you know my new planning

643
00:40:54,130 --> 00:41:00,190
horizon can't even see that we wanted to

644
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:03,079
develop no it's normal is the instance

645
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:06,559
of life but now this is civilization as

646
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:09,440
come to such a break that either we have

647
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:11,839
to work out a new attitude to the nature

648
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:15,140
and life or we're going to face such

649
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:17,599
problems we're no digital information no

650
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:22,038
new technologies we'll be able to help

651
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:24,920
us and now let me proceed to the points

652
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:27,920
what is information information can be

653
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:30,940
described you can define it through a

654
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:34,430
description it's the easiest thing to do

655
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:38,420
so information as opposed to knowledge

656
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:45,529
intuition experience insights you know

657
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:50,719
patterns of the sands has certain

658
00:41:45,529 --> 00:41:57,619
attributes there's a code or a cipher so

659
00:41:50,719 --> 00:42:02,589
we take some piece of reality and agree

660
00:41:57,619 --> 00:42:04,789
on using a cipher or a code to

661
00:42:02,589 --> 00:42:09,199
understand it that would be a language

662
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:13,489
of hieroglyphics characters musical

663
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:15,650
notes that will be a syntactic level of

664
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:18,049
information another level of information

665
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:22,279
we call the grammatical level is about

666
00:42:18,049 --> 00:42:25,670
the rules that will be applied to use

667
00:42:22,279 --> 00:42:28,299
this cipher it should propose that the

668
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:33,609
sequence should not be strictly

669
00:42:28,299 --> 00:42:36,559
periodical but with certain continual

670
00:42:33,609 --> 00:42:38,808
changes you can't have mama mama until

671
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:41,719
the end you need to have variation as so

672
00:42:38,809 --> 00:42:47,869
the decipher should take should make

673
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:49,430
sense also semantics that Shannon didn't

674
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:53,400
work with

675
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:55,950
so any information Amit has carried a

676
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:59,730
sense we can't say that information is

677
00:42:55,950 --> 00:43:02,879
nonsense or why does it have sense here

678
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:07,380
we'll get to the pragmatic level every

679
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:10,500
information impels to action because

680
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:15,930
over every information is a results of

681
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:19,320
consciousness which implies a goals this

682
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:20,910
is the most dangerous level

683
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:23,330
I still have seven minutes as I

684
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:26,990
understand so let's go to statistic

685
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:30,750
let's take an average American school

686
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:34,500
school child so they're not too much

687
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:38,910
different from school - in this country

688
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:42,860
so talk about survey statistics for the

689
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:48,180
middle of the twentieth oh no jeez so

690
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:52,370
this school kids has seen twenty

691
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:55,950
thousand letters reviewed 35,000

692
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:59,750
advertising videos and so 20,000 virtual

693
00:43:55,950 --> 00:44:03,390
murders or acts of violence so any

694
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:05,850
reasonable society will try to protect

695
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:08,190
is this is a young generation of

696
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:10,799
destructive thing because every

697
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:14,150
information carries a purpose and it

698
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:17,580
changes the mind it's known advertising

699
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:20,580
for propaganda everything are based on

700
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:23,310
that the modern society has decided to

701
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:26,130
know this why we can ask question well

702
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:32,240
perhaps if you follow the pragmatic

703
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:32,240
approach there is a certain plant

704
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:38,400
exploitation of such destructive

705
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:42,180
information but quite naturally for

706
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:44,610
different groups in the society that

707
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:47,250
exploits this destructive information

708
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:52,760
everybody has a different purpose so

709
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:52,760
therefore you get these gaps mismatches

710
00:44:53,740 --> 00:45:00,200
some people I want to sell more of their

711
00:44:57,470 --> 00:45:05,209
products gain attention earn money so

712
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:07,009
our society that does not meet the

713
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:13,310
pragmatic level of information it's

714
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:18,320
important that we knows of the this gets

715
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:24,140
to a situation which is dangerous for

716
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:27,770
his future so now we now proceed to the

717
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:30,730
fifth level it's go or purposeful level

718
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:36,170
any information the product of thought

719
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:39,820
especially creative information creating

720
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:42,500
information system presupposes creative

721
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:46,520
efforts and the purpose

722
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:49,430
anything you do first arrives as an idea

723
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:51,650
as a go and is then implemented I'll

724
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:54,348
stop here to make some conclusion so

725
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:56,390
it's not matter that lies as a

726
00:45:54,349 --> 00:46:00,920
foundation of the world even quantum

727
00:45:56,390 --> 00:46:04,040
physics would say it's to NIMH to think

728
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:06,349
like that but so the information energy

729
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:09,680
in information life as a matter energy

730
00:46:06,349 --> 00:46:12,230
and information that constitutes the

731
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:16,868
program that can defy the behavior of an

732
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:20,630
organism if we go back to the foundation

733
00:46:16,869 --> 00:46:24,050
let's say to the Christianity as the

734
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:26,300
foundation of the European and Russian

735
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:29,510
civilization even though it has I've

736
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:36,530
been quite depleted Christianity says

737
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:38,690
that some seminal logo sees a lie in the

738
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:42,170
foundation of the work it's just some

739
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:44,690
intense and I think that was the first

740
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:49,640
time because he proposed these ideas in

741
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:53,390
the sixth century AD these loga C's have

742
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:56,299
been put in place from the outset by God

743
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:59,029
logos in Greek means

744
00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:04,850
words but it has 20 other definitions

745
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:07,820
like number fairness so when they say

746
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:12,020
Lopez is not only about words it's about

747
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:13,940
a lot of other things so every thing has

748
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:18,070
been created according to the plan

749
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:19,910
purpose I think intention intention and

750
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:21,890
similar to this we can create

751
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:24,319
information technologies now by the way

752
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:27,740
as far as I know the most promising

753
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:30,980
areas in information technology is to

754
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:33,259
try and copy information technologies of

755
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:37,610
living nation for instance to create a

756
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:40,790
carrier information some super flash

757
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:43,760
drive that would bear resemblance with

758
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:47,720
DNA as a super storage system I think

759
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:56,690
there's a lot of freedom here for

760
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:59,980
creative thought so a modern person in

761
00:47:56,690 --> 00:48:06,320
the modern society of course we are all

762
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:09,800
impressed by how we welcome here in this

763
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:12,680
great room at there's great events we

764
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:15,380
feel excited by modern technologies we

765
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:18,049
all want to improve this world but we

766
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:20,690
shouldn't forget that there are

767
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:22,550
difficulties in this world as well and a

768
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:24,500
thousands of books have already been

769
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:26,000
written about this especially in the

770
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:29,600
West were lagging quite far behind

771
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:33,650
because in the Soviet times we weren't

772
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:37,910
supposed to write social criticism we

773
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:42,580
were supposed to only write you know

774
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:45,470
works of praise but people in the West

775
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:50,270
were not Marxists and so they created

776
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:53,720
this whole layer of literature yes Devin

777
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:57,680
are called modern humans of human

778
00:48:53,720 --> 00:49:02,259
society the Society of spectacle of

779
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:02,259
performance Paul Virilio

780
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:11,140
introduced the concept of acceleration

781
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:14,530
acceleration is not only about good

782
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:17,890
things but it's also about a danger of

783
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:20,410
for human psyche so the pace of

784
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:23,200
information exchange is so high that

785
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:26,950
people are forgetting their traditions

786
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:29,439
of their civilization norms we just

787
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:34,089
don't have enough time to pass our

788
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:36,250
experience down to generations and if

789
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:38,890
the world is disappearing thank God

790
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:42,130
in Russia we don't develop at such a

791
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:45,810
phase pace but such things as a

792
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:51,130
friendship love mutual understanding

793
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:52,840
start disappearing we lose this

794
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:56,260
communication and again it's about

795
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:58,960
losing creative capability these are the

796
00:49:56,260 --> 00:50:03,220
challenges of the modern world so we

797
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:07,030
live in the condition of emotional

798
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:09,279
excitement where society just goes

799
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:11,910
insane losing the instinct of

800
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:14,619
self-preservation I will send you off to

801
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:18,600
the book of Peter iam Sorokin

802
00:50:14,619 --> 00:50:23,770
sociology of evolution of course we

803
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:25,660
don't have clear attributes of

804
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:28,960
revolution here but the fact that we are

805
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:31,509
living in the condition of frenzy losing

806
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,970
a lot of things in our civilization says

807
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:36,100
that we are a spontaneous liberal

808
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:38,618
Society and revolutions don't create

809
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:41,950
revolutions only destroy this is also

810
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:43,570
very important yes I'm rolling up I will

811
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:48,299
have to skip a lot of other things that

812
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:49,590
I'd like to talk about so in a word my

813
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:53,830
[Music]

814
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:57,880
final statement is that in my opinion I

815
00:50:53,830 --> 00:50:59,680
may be wrong I may be too impressed

816
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,720
about what's happening in the world but

817
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:04,720
I can refer to the authority of Tatiana

818
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:06,520
Koren schewe a nominee of Alexander

819
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:10,480
Petrovsky

820
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:13,300
Awards very well now thinker I met her I

821
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:17,710
talked to her I took an interview she's

822
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:20,070
a very significant person in the world

823
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:23,890
of modern thoughts and she and I

824
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:26,980
subscribe to her ideas so we believe

825
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:30,279
that in spite of the great opportunities

826
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:33,609
the digital civilization is offering we

827
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:36,910
the humankind only have two ways to go

828
00:51:33,609 --> 00:51:39,520
the first one is to turn into the

829
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:42,279
planets of apes and Hollywood's you know

830
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:46,180
showed us a good number of examples like

831
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:49,720
that tick mark maths that about complete

832
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:52,710
moral degradation of humankind because

833
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:56,140
there are no resources for development

834
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:59,230
another way if we are going to go away

835
00:51:56,140 --> 00:52:04,359
from this road would be in a very

836
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:07,810
attentive and cautious way of embedding

837
00:52:04,359 --> 00:52:09,279
the modern society and digital

838
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:12,220
technology might help us there as well

839
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:14,950
into the nature to live within the

840
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:19,330
rhythm of nature because digital economy

841
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:22,118
allows us to go away from the intrusive

842
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:23,500
of production schematics that through in

843
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:25,089
the earth thank you for your attention

844
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:26,380
if you have any questions I am prepared

845
00:52:25,089 --> 00:52:30,310
to take them thank you for your

846
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:32,650
presentation dear participants I bigger

847
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:34,690
pardoned we're running out of time we

848
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:37,720
still have to hear three presentations

849
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:40,930
and only 60 minutes of pure time so I

850
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:43,390
propose that we just a switch to the

851
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:46,710
next speaker and I'll get questions

852
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:50,470
answers or find the next presentation

853
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:52,960
goes to a leonid victory which Golikov

854
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:56,348
he'll speak about opportunities of

855
00:52:52,960 --> 00:53:03,220
building a virtual network based

856
00:52:56,349 --> 00:53:05,859
information state he is he was in the

857
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:09,060
Academy of the investor to Investigative

858
00:53:05,859 --> 00:53:09,060
Committee of the Russian Federation

859
00:53:17,289 --> 00:53:21,710
Kotick we're going to be discussing

860
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:23,660
about the birth of the possibility of

861
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:27,289
building an innovative information

862
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:30,379
society this constant goes back to 2001

863
00:53:27,289 --> 00:53:33,259
when I published a paper and put an

864
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:35,890
article about the future legal

865
00:53:33,259 --> 00:53:44,539
technologists and then it grew into a

866
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:46,430
theory this theory of network law it

867
00:53:44,539 --> 00:53:52,869
doesn't mean that it's a completely new

868
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:57,109
branch of law this is just kind of a a

869
00:53:52,869 --> 00:54:02,359
separate a look on law in the context of

870
00:53:57,109 --> 00:54:04,519
network before this question didn't

871
00:54:02,359 --> 00:54:07,119
arise but now it's becoming a more and

872
00:54:04,519 --> 00:54:10,008
more relevant antenna published a

873
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:13,609
monograph which was sent to the

874
00:54:10,009 --> 00:54:16,160
president and to other government

875
00:54:13,609 --> 00:54:22,009
authorities so it turns out that our

876
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:25,848
government is realizing more and more

877
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:28,069
more more strongly that this is an

878
00:54:25,849 --> 00:54:31,279
important concept that needs to take

879
00:54:28,069 --> 00:54:33,619
shape so what does it have and by the

880
00:54:31,279 --> 00:54:37,249
way there were different names that it

881
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:40,609
was named by in 2013 President Putin

882
00:54:37,249 --> 00:54:42,439
made a speech at default a forum and

883
00:54:40,609 --> 00:54:45,499
which he mentioned that Russia doesn't

884
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:48,829
have a national idea and then in

885
00:54:45,499 --> 00:54:51,200
December I sent my publication to him it

886
00:54:48,829 --> 00:54:55,730
was called and the doctrine of national

887
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:59,950
consolidation which included some of the

888
00:54:55,730 --> 00:55:03,499
key concept the doctrine of networked

889
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:05,598
consolidation so this explained how this

890
00:55:03,499 --> 00:55:07,640
whole thing can be done teas conditions

891
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:09,980
the conditions that we are now difficult

892
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:13,779
because our government before sanctions

893
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:17,239
and after the sanctions ended up in

894
00:55:13,779 --> 00:55:19,880
ended up at I'm pass you know the state

895
00:55:17,239 --> 00:55:23,450
of our health care culture education I

896
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:29,480
come from education and even as the

897
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:33,078
president even the president recognized

898
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:36,950
that we had destroyed that we have

899
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:39,170
destroyed the institution of Graduate

900
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:41,269
School in Russia and it has to be

901
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:45,410
somehow restorative but nobody knows how

902
00:55:41,269 --> 00:55:49,238
to do it so we believe that there is a

903
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:55,308
tool that can be used to help us no

904
00:55:49,239 --> 00:55:57,799
single country cannot be taken from

905
00:55:55,309 --> 00:56:00,799
point-a with all the problems to point B

906
00:55:57,799 --> 00:56:04,130
where everything is fine

907
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:11,299
there has to be a path perhaps long and

908
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:14,029
winding we are still beset by our past

909
00:56:11,299 --> 00:56:15,920
thinking habits I'm going to give you

910
00:56:14,029 --> 00:56:20,390
more legal habits let me give you a

911
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:26,119
classical examples numbers the numbers

912
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:29,328
that lawyers don't like to cite at the

913
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:31,609
time when the Soviet Union disappeared

914
00:56:29,329 --> 00:56:34,279
there were about a hundred two hundred

915
00:56:31,609 --> 00:56:37,930
laws they were they had different laws

916
00:56:34,279 --> 00:56:40,789
or roughly two hundred laws currently

917
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:43,339
there are eight thousand federal laws

918
00:56:40,789 --> 00:56:48,079
wishes which is several orders of

919
00:56:43,339 --> 00:56:53,239
magnitude larger so the question is does

920
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:56,059
it make our life better no it doesn't so

921
00:56:53,239 --> 00:56:57,559
why do we have so many laws and these

922
00:56:56,059 --> 00:57:00,019
are only federal laws

923
00:56:57,559 --> 00:57:02,239
speaking about of regional laws in the

924
00:57:00,019 --> 00:57:06,288
Soviet Union there were no regional laws

925
00:57:02,239 --> 00:57:08,420
if you remember Linnaean criticized this

926
00:57:06,289 --> 00:57:13,130
approach of regionalism

927
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:17,210
but now we have regions and volga region

928
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:19,849
in Volgograd region and so on so every

929
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:24,859
region of the Russian Federation has its

930
00:57:19,849 --> 00:57:28,160
own set of laws so hundreds hundreds of

931
00:57:24,859 --> 00:57:33,859
thousands of laws about a hundred over a

932
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:36,710
hundred thousand laws if you look at the

933
00:57:33,859 --> 00:57:44,720
not only federal but the regional was as

934
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:48,710
well so we have this runaway gouging of

935
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:50,689
the number of laws so what do we do in

936
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:57,339
this situation the numbers that I have

937
00:57:50,690 --> 00:58:02,059
given you are not the most serious thing

938
00:57:57,339 --> 00:58:06,049
it's now much worse if we consider it a

939
00:58:02,059 --> 00:58:10,789
number of strategies there are documents

940
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:13,369
called strategies well in the ideal

941
00:58:10,789 --> 00:58:15,890
world there should be only one strategy

942
00:58:13,369 --> 00:58:18,349
and then the strategy should be broken

943
00:58:15,890 --> 00:58:21,250
down into plans but now it's very hard

944
00:58:18,349 --> 00:58:24,940
to calculate the number of strategies

945
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:27,710
there are a hundred and forty two

946
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:33,799
strategies that have been able to find

947
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:37,759
from pork farming to argue culture to

948
00:58:33,799 --> 00:58:38,960
regional development and the regional if

949
00:58:37,759 --> 00:58:44,259
you take into account regional

950
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:47,269
strategies we end up with about 1200

951
00:58:44,259 --> 00:58:49,509
1200 strategies can you think about it

952
00:58:47,269 --> 00:58:49,508
just

953
00:58:51,400 --> 00:59:07,580
so if we if we split the trigonometric

954
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:10,100
circle into degrees and then for each

955
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:14,509
degree of direction we have three

956
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:17,450
strategies or three potential directions

957
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:23,450
where to go so that's that situation is

958
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:25,790
completely completely not normal and we

959
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:29,950
propose a doctrine of national

960
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:34,250
consolidation through a virtual network

961
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:37,970
innovative governmental state why do we

962
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:44,240
use the word innovative all the previous

963
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:48,560
empires disappear for their own sets of

964
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:54,799
reasons but one thing in common that

965
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:57,170
they had is the fact that they but it

966
00:59:54,800 --> 01:00:00,260
missed something important in the Roman

967
00:59:57,170 --> 01:00:02,450
Empire the corruption problem was really

968
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:08,210
serious and they didn't want to solve

969
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:12,680
this so innovation is it is an essential

970
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:15,920
component in this strategy so how do we

971
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:22,359
do it while before we couldn't even

972
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:22,360
imagine this now we have networks in law

973
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:36,670
in law we don't have as many networks

974
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:39,860
but still in economics in marketing

975
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:45,830
mm-hmm you know network marketing has

976
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:48,620
been quite popular recently even courses

977
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:54,040
in network marketing right but not in

978
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:58,509
law lawyers are kind of reluctant to

979
01:00:54,040 --> 01:01:03,300
recognize the fact that network

980
01:00:58,510 --> 01:01:07,840
and networks are everywhere even in law

981
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:16,270
and you have I have seen even

982
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:20,080
conferences dedicated to this topic many

983
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:22,600
universities have considered conducting

984
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:25,680
similar events they have even asked me

985
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:25,680
direct questions

986
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:33,310
however some universities have expressed

987
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:37,330
their disagreement with a theory to the

988
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:48,130
point that this theory was even declared

989
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:51,490
off-limits the rationale was that if no

990
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:55,480
lawyers could understand this theory and

991
01:01:51,490 --> 01:02:02,080
then no student definitely could could

992
01:01:55,480 --> 01:02:04,960
definitely understand it so the this

993
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:09,450
theory has not been successful but then

994
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:15,160
again we come back to the fight to this

995
01:02:09,450 --> 01:02:19,270
standoff between the old and the new way

996
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:23,549
of thinking and so on so we are just

997
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:28,960
repeating what was in the past

998
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:31,730
modern networked business

999
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:39,260
forms are quite widespread rivers

1000
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:43,180
everywhere in China in Vatican networks

1001
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:48,680
of intelligence banks and universities

1002
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:54,470
production networks transnational

1003
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:55,419
networks networks of transnational

1004
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:58,580
corporations

1005
01:02:55,420 --> 01:03:02,990
so again networks are everywhere they

1006
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:10,910
pervade our everyday lives our very

1007
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:14,600
existence so we have to keep up with

1008
01:03:10,910 --> 01:03:19,960
this trend I'd like to give you a quote

1009
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:19,960
from innovating expertise it's a journal

1010
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:30,350
here's what is emotion Kendra Chowk

1011
01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:35,270
brought an example of network Wars can

1012
01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:39,290
be cross-functional teams created in the

1013
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:43,820
Pentagon and these cross-functional

1014
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:46,070
teams are created in order to gain

1015
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:48,130
advantage across the board

1016
01:03:46,070 --> 01:03:54,040
this called full spectrum dominance

1017
01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:54,040
that's what they're trying to achieve so

1018
01:03:54,130 --> 01:04:01,820
these concepts are actually developed

1019
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:08,500
and pursued in the financial sphere in

1020
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:08,500
the defense in economic areas and so on

1021
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:20,410
wars are constantly conducted in the

1022
01:04:13,150 --> 01:04:25,070
information in the cyber space 24/7

1023
01:04:20,410 --> 01:04:26,990
we cannot see that take a break we will

1024
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:31,960
figure things out and then we will do

1025
01:04:26,990 --> 01:04:31,959
this war no it doesn't work that way

1026
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:40,580
ten days ago there was a conference from

1027
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:43,030
a round table bringing together members

1028
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:47,630
of the central bank Rocephin monitoring

1029
01:04:43,030 --> 01:04:51,740
and other agencies and this round table

1030
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:54,890
was to discuss cryptocurrencies and

1031
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:56,779
related issues and during the round

1032
01:04:54,890 --> 01:05:01,910
table became clear that there was no

1033
01:04:56,780 --> 01:05:04,310
solution to the issues breezed nobody

1034
01:05:01,910 --> 01:05:06,470
proposed a real solution because this is

1035
01:05:04,310 --> 01:05:09,890
such a complex problem that the

1036
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:13,160
community of our best minds cannot solve

1037
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:16,960
it but that's just one of the network

1038
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:21,950
problems but there are other problems

1039
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:24,020
that related to faith currencies things

1040
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:26,450
like terrorism extremism because

1041
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:32,390
extremism and terrorism are also network

1042
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:37,810
problems these problems are present but

1043
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:40,069
we don't know how to address them so

1044
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:43,880
standard ways of addressing problems

1045
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:49,100
such as set up a think-tank or a

1046
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:52,430
university or some research organization

1047
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:54,980
it doesn't work because that takes way

1048
01:05:52,430 --> 01:05:59,140
too much time while these network

1049
01:05:54,980 --> 01:06:02,900
processes are always are always fast in

1050
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:05,330
fast developing so to overcome or to

1051
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:09,050
mitigate these problems we propose

1052
01:06:05,330 --> 01:06:12,569
creating new structure the state in a

1053
01:06:09,050 --> 01:06:16,919
virtual network to format

1054
01:06:12,569 --> 01:06:22,729
these words in fact were not very

1055
01:06:16,919 --> 01:06:22,729
well-received by some of the officials

1056
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:32,130
me officials kind of reluctant to accept

1057
01:06:27,509 --> 01:06:34,109
these terms they always tend to put a

1058
01:06:32,130 --> 01:06:35,609
negative spin on them but there is

1059
01:06:34,109 --> 01:06:42,390
nothing negative about them they are

1060
01:06:35,609 --> 01:06:44,578
neutral so we need to turn our thinking

1061
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:48,089
and to use these networks for the good

1062
01:06:44,579 --> 01:06:51,869
good not for some Ponzi schemes but the

1063
01:06:48,089 --> 01:06:59,390
mechanism is always the same the Ponzi

1064
01:06:51,869 --> 01:07:02,969
schemes well that's that's an example of

1065
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:09,379
using network technologies for harmful

1066
01:07:02,969 --> 01:07:13,099
ends but you can create you can do

1067
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:15,749
something for for some positive ends

1068
01:07:13,099 --> 01:07:22,439
using the same technologies you can do

1069
01:07:15,749 --> 01:07:25,759
this methods are the same but the

1070
01:07:22,439 --> 01:07:29,279
results are different so we shouldn't be

1071
01:07:25,759 --> 01:07:34,519
afraid to use the methods that somebody

1072
01:07:29,279 --> 01:07:38,279
at some point in the past used for some

1073
01:07:34,519 --> 01:07:41,758
bad purpose what do we need a virtual

1074
01:07:38,279 --> 01:07:44,099
format because in a real country we

1075
01:07:41,759 --> 01:07:46,489
can't change anything because the

1076
01:07:44,099 --> 01:07:52,229
changes are really hard to accomplish

1077
01:07:46,489 --> 01:07:54,439
when I write something write something I

1078
01:07:52,229 --> 01:07:58,919
make a suggestion but then with a

1079
01:07:54,439 --> 01:08:02,759
significant temporal lag these proposals

1080
01:07:58,919 --> 01:08:08,240
are kind of implemented but that only

1081
01:08:02,759 --> 01:08:12,900
happens in 3 or 5 years that's to us too

1082
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:15,870
much time to wait we can't afford to

1083
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:18,600
wait so much time so who can be

1084
01:08:15,870 --> 01:08:23,279
participants and actors in this network

1085
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:26,070
structure young hackers exactly the kind

1086
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:29,580
of people that we happen to be with all

1087
01:08:26,069 --> 01:08:31,880
these people can be in you can get

1088
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:33,450
involved in the creation of this new

1089
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:38,790
formative state

1090
01:08:33,450 --> 01:08:42,450
why did Putin back in 2013 highlighted

1091
01:08:38,790 --> 01:08:46,500
the issue of the absence of our national

1092
01:08:42,450 --> 01:08:50,220
idea that's a real issue

1093
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:59,660
so this virtual state can be both an end

1094
01:08:50,220 --> 01:09:03,330
and the means we can we can take

1095
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:06,180
something we already have and lay in the

1096
01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:11,220
foundation of this new virtual network

1097
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:20,310
state or we can start things from

1098
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:25,350
scratch law is like a law is like a

1099
01:09:20,310 --> 01:09:29,070
pendulum it moves from rules to from

1100
01:09:25,350 --> 01:09:32,310
principles to laws so currently we are

1101
01:09:29,069 --> 01:09:35,490
at a point where we have thousands of

1102
01:09:32,310 --> 01:09:39,330
rules thousands of rules but and it is

1103
01:09:35,490 --> 01:09:44,330
impossible it is impossible to continue

1104
01:09:39,330 --> 01:09:48,870
on the same path because this there's an

1105
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:51,779
incredibly huge number of laws and rules

1106
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:54,930
is just impossible to know them all and

1107
01:09:51,779 --> 01:09:57,450
observe them all but there should be

1108
01:09:54,930 --> 01:09:59,610
principles these principles are easy to

1109
01:09:57,450 --> 01:10:01,980
know they are easy to follow they're

1110
01:09:59,610 --> 01:10:05,160
easy to accomplish they're always based

1111
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:08,580
on common sense you don't have to be a

1112
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:11,579
walking database to know everything and

1113
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:15,340
to be compliant

1114
01:10:11,579 --> 01:10:19,058
Russia doesn't have the time that cannot

1115
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:22,869
afford to spend time on endless

1116
01:10:19,059 --> 01:10:26,499
experiments we have to start acting we

1117
01:10:22,869 --> 01:10:34,299
have to get results now we can't wait

1118
01:10:26,499 --> 01:10:40,300
any longer there are very many

1119
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:42,639
technicalities that can be accomplished

1120
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:45,820
but the strategic that the strategic

1121
01:10:42,639 --> 01:10:49,419
knows will not be accomplished because

1122
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:53,228
the ultimate search engine goal is to

1123
01:10:49,419 --> 01:10:58,050
support the person to support this

1124
01:10:53,229 --> 01:11:01,499
citizen and I believe that our lawmakers

1125
01:10:58,050 --> 01:11:04,300
have lost sight of this essential fact

1126
01:11:01,499 --> 01:11:09,159
that the law should be aimed at

1127
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:12,130
supporting the person we have many

1128
01:11:09,159 --> 01:11:17,228
different concepts such as the plaintiff

1129
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:19,689
the accused the physical because of the

1130
01:11:17,229 --> 01:11:26,769
physical person the concept of legal

1131
01:11:19,689 --> 01:11:28,599
person we are losing the concept of the

1132
01:11:26,769 --> 01:11:31,209
human being the concept of human being

1133
01:11:28,599 --> 01:11:39,939
we're losing sight of this and it should

1134
01:11:31,209 --> 01:11:44,380
come back in a big way also we can talk

1135
01:11:39,939 --> 01:11:49,659
of what we would like to call modern

1136
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:53,650
laws or model state we can limit our

1137
01:11:49,659 --> 01:12:00,679
ourselves to an essential set of laws of

1138
01:11:53,650 --> 01:12:06,929
which there can be a hundred or 200

1139
01:12:00,679 --> 01:12:13,380
we can optimize the codes including the

1140
01:12:06,929 --> 01:12:15,600
criminal code however however it's not

1141
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:18,179
modern that matters we should be

1142
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:21,960
involved in the business of modeling the

1143
01:12:18,179 --> 01:12:28,230
state the state that is modeled to fit a

1144
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:32,630
certain idea the purpose will be very

1145
01:12:28,230 --> 01:12:37,259
simple to invest in innovation patents

1146
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:41,340
creating material value in the real

1147
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:47,960
sector of the economy and by the way a

1148
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:52,860
specific components of this of this

1149
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:56,219
program are listed in the federal law

1150
01:12:52,860 --> 01:13:02,309
that was signed by the President of the

1151
01:12:56,219 --> 01:13:05,610
Russian Federation is my time up yes

1152
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:10,409
unfortunately I cannot explain all the

1153
01:13:05,610 --> 01:13:12,509
theory because it's it's big but we have

1154
01:13:10,409 --> 01:13:15,210
the instruments we have the method we

1155
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:18,560
know what to do we know what steps to

1156
01:13:15,210 --> 01:13:24,590
take and we have listed them or

1157
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:24,590
methodology is ready we can suggest this

1158
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:34,949
methodology to anyone that wants to take

1159
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:38,040
it so we need to start acting on the

1160
01:13:34,949 --> 01:13:39,480
strategy to start moving from point A

1161
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:43,530
where we are now

1162
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:46,589
to point B we need to take as many

1163
01:13:43,530 --> 01:13:49,860
people as possible without any

1164
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:53,020
revolutions without any breakdowns thank

1165
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:58,250
you very much for your presentation

1166
01:13:53,020 --> 01:14:01,070
we have our time limit if you have

1167
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:05,390
question please keep them remember them

1168
01:14:01,070 --> 01:14:10,400
until the end and then ask them our next

1169
01:14:05,390 --> 01:14:16,159
presentation is Constantine Zurich thank

1170
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:29,960
you very much perhaps something is wrong

1171
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:34,549
with our round table because the there's

1172
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:37,190
not much interest however I I'll try to

1173
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:42,199
make my presentation is interesting as

1174
01:14:37,190 --> 01:14:45,320
possible because well we have been doing

1175
01:14:42,199 --> 01:14:47,780
I mean what I have been doing with my

1176
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:52,759
colleagues students and graduate

1177
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:56,170
students is really interesting and

1178
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:58,940
there's a certain level of extremity

1179
01:14:56,170 --> 01:15:03,800
these information technologies will give

1180
01:14:58,940 --> 01:15:06,620
us untold benefits I don't want to

1181
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:11,480
comment on this the name is on the

1182
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:14,199
screen but why why is this company

1183
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:18,519
called extreme technologies and systems

1184
01:15:14,199 --> 01:15:26,150
extreme technologies are ones that

1185
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:29,810
technologies that give a superiority in

1186
01:15:26,150 --> 01:15:32,259
their own class so without these

1187
01:15:29,810 --> 01:15:36,260
technologies you can create a good thing

1188
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:40,130
yes you can do without them but if you

1189
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:43,239
want something superior you need these

1190
01:15:40,130 --> 01:15:43,239
extreme technologies

1191
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:51,130
I've not going to discuss them all but

1192
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:57,490
one of them but one of them I'd like to

1193
01:15:51,130 --> 01:16:01,810
focus my presentation please go to the

1194
01:15:57,490 --> 01:16:06,059
next slide whose house of you who are IT

1195
01:16:01,810 --> 01:16:12,460
specialists more experienced scientists

1196
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:14,770
specialists artificial intelligence was

1197
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:16,660
on the rise while 30 years ago there

1198
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:20,860
were a lot of publications there was a

1199
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:24,540
lot of research but it went nowhere at

1200
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:31,719
that point it didn't produce anything

1201
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:35,230
groundbreaking so there was a big AI

1202
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:38,590
winter now we are experiencing a

1203
01:16:35,230 --> 01:16:42,759
renaissance in AI technologies so this

1204
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:49,950
is an example of extreme technology this

1205
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:55,810
technology will allow us to to achieve

1206
01:16:49,950 --> 01:16:57,370
great benefits this time I remember when

1207
01:16:55,810 --> 01:17:02,170
people were talking especially

1208
01:16:57,370 --> 01:17:06,340
specialists were talking about AEI they

1209
01:17:02,170 --> 01:17:11,130
never discussed it in a serious way back

1210
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:15,970
then but now things have changed so why

1211
01:17:11,130 --> 01:17:19,540
30 years ago this effort to create in an

1212
01:17:15,970 --> 01:17:23,100
AI was unsuccessful because there were

1213
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:23,100
no answers to four questions

1214
01:17:25,649 --> 01:17:29,249
there are no answers to four questions

1215
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:36,789
first

1216
01:17:29,249 --> 01:17:39,389
nobody clearly I am a technical

1217
01:17:36,789 --> 01:17:43,629
specialist I'm not a humanitarian day

1218
01:17:39,389 --> 01:17:46,959
I'd like to kind of delimit some of the

1219
01:17:43,629 --> 01:17:48,550
notions we have to clarify what is

1220
01:17:46,959 --> 01:17:54,099
knowledge which is information what is

1221
01:17:48,550 --> 01:18:01,139
data and this dried on top of this trade

1222
01:17:54,099 --> 01:18:05,499
we have digital aliases what are they

1223
01:18:01,139 --> 01:18:07,360
they are digital knowledge containers

1224
01:18:05,499 --> 01:18:11,639
this is exactly what was like in 30

1225
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:15,539
years ago and this this list was

1226
01:18:11,639 --> 01:18:20,439
incomplete without these digital aliases

1227
01:18:15,539 --> 01:18:25,409
so we need to clearly formalize these

1228
01:18:20,439 --> 01:18:29,739
notions they included in the last one

1229
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:33,188
digital aliases so this was the

1230
01:18:29,739 --> 01:18:36,728
stumbling block which didn't allow the

1231
01:18:33,189 --> 01:18:38,829
AI effort to be successful and then we

1232
01:18:36,729 --> 01:18:41,590
need to figure out the structure and

1233
01:18:38,829 --> 01:18:46,259
metric of the information information

1234
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:50,530
space the term space and mathematics

1235
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:53,019
requires a certain structure and a

1236
01:18:50,530 --> 01:18:57,009
certain set of axioms that must be

1237
01:18:53,019 --> 01:18:58,689
satisfied only then do you have a space

1238
01:18:57,010 --> 01:19:01,239
if you don't have the accidents if you

1239
01:18:58,689 --> 01:19:05,860
don't have structure you can't talk of

1240
01:19:01,239 --> 01:19:08,919
having space so I believe that's a the

1241
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:14,219
more humanitarian people to use the term

1242
01:19:08,919 --> 01:19:14,219
space is sometimes inappropriate

1243
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:21,290
so is it possible to measure the space

1244
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:26,750
remember what plank Max Planck said what

1245
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:28,850
you can't measure doesn't exist so the

1246
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:30,770
question is is it possible to measure

1247
01:19:28,850 --> 01:19:32,180
and knowledge what is the artificial

1248
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:34,100
intelligence it's just a container of

1249
01:19:32,180 --> 01:19:39,550
knowledge if you can't measure how much

1250
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:39,550
knowledge you have put into an AI system

1251
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:48,290
it's probably not what you're talking

1252
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:55,010
about let's talk about an example one

1253
01:19:48,290 --> 01:19:56,930
person is building a heart from food and

1254
01:19:55,010 --> 01:20:00,080
the second person is built in a

1255
01:19:56,930 --> 01:20:03,940
three-story Hut and the third person is

1256
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:08,180
building it from let's say from hay and

1257
01:20:03,940 --> 01:20:16,549
everybody keeps saying that their heart

1258
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:18,920
is better that's that's a situation in

1259
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:23,740
which there is no metric how do you

1260
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:26,870
measure what better was worse so again I

1261
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:29,960
insist that there needs to be a number

1262
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:37,970
that you can put on the amount of

1263
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:42,200
knowledge a metric I see that Claude

1264
01:20:37,970 --> 01:20:46,610
Shannon is smiling at me there needs to

1265
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:50,540
be a conceptual model I'm not a

1266
01:20:46,610 --> 01:20:59,210
specialist on that basis I'd like to say

1267
01:20:50,540 --> 01:21:01,470
that though that at the current dbmss do

1268
01:20:59,210 --> 01:21:07,600
not contain

1269
01:21:01,470 --> 01:21:11,950
tools for knowledge of representation in

1270
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:14,220
the form that is needed for an AI it

1271
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:19,059
doesn't have an element of temporality

1272
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:22,090
we cannot we cannot stop the development

1273
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:26,860
of some modeling processes we cannot

1274
01:21:22,090 --> 01:21:28,870
take a snapshot we're interested in in

1275
01:21:26,860 --> 01:21:31,030
what was in the past what is now and

1276
01:21:28,870 --> 01:21:39,550
what would be in what will be in the

1277
01:21:31,030 --> 01:21:44,200
future we need to be able to model the

1278
01:21:39,550 --> 01:21:47,380
progression through time we need to be

1279
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:51,000
able to add several such alternative

1280
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:55,810
histories and drivel to a model so

1281
01:21:51,000 --> 01:22:01,420
nothing of this kind is supported by any

1282
01:21:55,810 --> 01:22:05,200
of the current TPMS the second thing

1283
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:11,430
that we need to achieve a recursion of

1284
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:11,429
the objects stored in databases

1285
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:20,340
databases have a very strict hierarchy

1286
01:22:17,530 --> 01:22:25,989
of objects of this hierarchy of objects

1287
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:31,659
implemented and databases yes this kind

1288
01:22:25,989 --> 01:22:34,409
of culminates in the cortege this this

1289
01:22:31,659 --> 01:22:37,629
is something that you cannot extend

1290
01:22:34,409 --> 01:22:40,330
Syria tables there are collections of

1291
01:22:37,630 --> 01:22:42,880
tables the database which is the

1292
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:45,519
collection of collections and then on

1293
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:48,760
top of this whole thing you have DBMS

1294
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:53,969
that's not adequate it's not enough and

1295
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:58,360
question four is a quantitative measure

1296
01:22:53,969 --> 01:23:02,310
of the fullness of knowledge accumulated

1297
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:09,309
for achieving the guaranteed quality of

1298
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:11,739
processes no that's that is something

1299
01:23:09,310 --> 01:23:14,409
that we're still lacking we need to have

1300
01:23:11,739 --> 01:23:16,780
this quantitative measure we need to

1301
01:23:14,409 --> 01:23:21,610
know how much knowledge needs to be put

1302
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:24,009
into the system to guarantee that we

1303
01:23:21,610 --> 01:23:27,400
achieve the desired result let's say

1304
01:23:24,010 --> 01:23:30,190
management result and if we put less

1305
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:32,679
than the required amount of knowledge

1306
01:23:30,190 --> 01:23:37,379
then the process will not be successful

1307
01:23:32,679 --> 01:23:37,380
or will proceed stochastically

1308
01:23:37,870 --> 01:23:46,900
here we have a definition of the of

1309
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:50,360
digital alias

1310
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:54,400
digital alias in the way that it is

1311
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:59,360
accepted by the Moscow school of digital

1312
01:23:54,400 --> 01:24:02,089
aliases a digital analysis is a virtual

1313
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:06,730
analog of a physical object as a

1314
01:24:02,090 --> 01:24:11,770
preparatory l' physical dynamics

1315
01:24:06,730 --> 01:24:16,009
structure state and temporal dynamics

1316
01:24:11,770 --> 01:24:18,830
i'm not going to list its properties

1317
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:22,940
this nothing to comment on a digital

1318
01:24:18,830 --> 01:24:27,830
alias is an instrument of solving

1319
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:31,070
practical problems that's an important

1320
01:24:27,830 --> 01:24:35,389
and interesting thing I'd like to spend

1321
01:24:31,070 --> 01:24:37,250
a few minutes on this I'd like to spend

1322
01:24:35,389 --> 01:24:43,100
a few minutes perhaps this is gonna be a

1323
01:24:37,250 --> 01:24:49,850
little bit hardcore for you for example

1324
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:51,900
we have an observable object we need to

1325
01:24:49,850 --> 01:24:55,020
create a digital alias of this object

1326
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:55,019
[Music]

1327
01:24:56,100 --> 01:25:05,770
how do things work now an observed

1328
01:25:00,250 --> 01:25:08,440
object is an object or a site where we

1329
01:25:05,770 --> 01:25:09,430
collect data and by the way we need to

1330
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:10,660
answer the question what's the

1331
01:25:09,430 --> 01:25:13,560
difference between information and data

1332
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:23,559
data the question the answer is simple

1333
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:26,260
information is always is always based on

1334
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:34,950
some variable system but it data may or

1335
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:42,520
may not have it if the data that I

1336
01:25:34,950 --> 01:25:44,620
transfer to you in Russian if I switch

1337
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:46,900
to Chinese which song you may not know

1338
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:52,960
you will continue to receive data but

1339
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:55,509
not information so there should be a

1340
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:59,820
step of subjective ization so when you

1341
01:25:55,510 --> 01:26:05,490
get data you interpret and then each

1342
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:09,330
other data and then perhaps this data

1343
01:26:05,490 --> 01:26:13,559
becomes information because there is a

1344
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:16,840
verbal code for it but that's not enough

1345
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:19,630
what do we need to make information to

1346
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:21,460
turn it into knowledge knowledge is

1347
01:26:19,630 --> 01:26:23,860
based on too little empirical knowledge

1348
01:26:21,460 --> 01:26:27,010
there there is empirical knowledge and

1349
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:32,889
theoretical knowledge empirical

1350
01:26:27,010 --> 01:26:36,150
knowledge is what you receive now using

1351
01:26:32,890 --> 01:26:41,960
the semantic system

1352
01:26:36,150 --> 01:26:41,960
the code that I use which is Russian and

1353
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:53,519
based on what I am Telling You you are

1354
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:56,849
subjective isin internalizing this

1355
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:59,390
information you digest this information

1356
01:26:56,850 --> 01:27:05,909
[Music]

1357
01:26:59,390 --> 01:27:08,630
you pass it through the experience that

1358
01:27:05,909 --> 01:27:12,449
you already have at this point if I ask

1359
01:27:08,630 --> 01:27:16,290
some of you to reproduce what I have

1360
01:27:12,449 --> 01:27:23,280
said then your subjective knowledge will

1361
01:27:16,290 --> 01:27:27,030
be objectified objectifies so you can

1362
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:33,000
objective eyes your knowledge and turn

1363
01:27:27,030 --> 01:27:37,650
it into another entity and by the way

1364
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:40,020
this is where digital entities appear so

1365
01:27:37,650 --> 01:27:42,000
digital entities are based on knowledge

1366
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:45,300
knowledge is based on affirming

1367
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:50,969
information is based on data that may be

1368
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:52,890
a difficult concept but unfortunately I

1369
01:27:50,969 --> 01:27:57,330
don't have enough time to explain it in

1370
01:27:52,890 --> 01:27:59,400
more detail so when we get some

1371
01:27:57,330 --> 01:28:07,309
knowledge and by the way this is the

1372
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:11,040
digital model of some subject area by

1373
01:28:07,310 --> 01:28:15,540
observing this digital entities you can

1374
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:18,420
generate new knowledge you can get

1375
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:21,660
something else and this process can be

1376
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:28,500
recurrent this is described by karavayev

1377
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:36,139
and by other authors so this is an

1378
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:39,810
iterative recurrent process I have

1379
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:45,480
mentioned this okay some information can

1380
01:28:39,810 --> 01:28:50,510
be lost due to the fact that persons may

1381
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:50,509
not digest all the information received

1382
01:28:55,840 --> 01:29:06,080
you know some researchers even say that

1383
01:28:59,179 --> 01:29:08,810
we can we can decompose into this into

1384
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:10,940
molecules or physical bodies into

1385
01:29:08,810 --> 01:29:13,900
molecules but we don't know what to do

1386
01:29:10,940 --> 01:29:21,799
with these molecules we cannot extract

1387
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:24,949
knowledge or enough knowledge I don't

1388
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:28,699
know if there are any engineers here

1389
01:29:24,949 --> 01:29:33,820
that create prototypes raise your hand

1390
01:29:28,699 --> 01:29:40,070
if you're an engineer here no engineers

1391
01:29:33,820 --> 01:29:44,210
I'd like to apologize for this this is

1392
01:29:40,070 --> 01:29:48,909
the Cauchy inequality that is very

1393
01:29:44,210 --> 01:29:53,080
famous so we can represent a digital

1394
01:29:48,909 --> 01:29:58,730
entity using this inequality or Cauchy

1395
01:29:53,080 --> 01:30:01,850
inequality so if we do over the system

1396
01:29:58,730 --> 01:30:05,169
or system mechanisms that include

1397
01:30:01,850 --> 01:30:05,170
mechanisms about

1398
01:30:07,580 --> 01:30:12,120
some aspects of engineering philosophy

1399
01:30:09,870 --> 01:30:15,240
by the way this is a specific this is a

1400
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:17,880
course that is read in technical

1401
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:26,820
universities especially in German

1402
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:32,460
technical universities so this for our

1403
01:30:26,820 --> 01:30:33,719
engineer is to limit what will an

1404
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:35,990
engineer in philosophy

1405
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:39,120
tell us if you look at the left term

1406
01:30:35,990 --> 01:30:41,040
that compromise of the system

1407
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:45,300
characteristics if you look at the right

1408
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:47,610
terms these are alternatives of system

1409
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:49,770
characteristics and the system engineers

1410
01:30:47,610 --> 01:30:52,580
is that the alternative in technical

1411
01:30:49,770 --> 01:30:57,300
systems is those is the alternatives is

1412
01:30:52,580 --> 01:31:00,330
the more small preferable than the

1413
01:30:57,300 --> 01:31:02,880
compromise so these are the primary data

1414
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:07,130
in this is the secondary objective

1415
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:09,810
ization and the alternative look

1416
01:31:07,130 --> 01:31:16,890
technical systems based on compromise to

1417
01:31:09,810 --> 01:31:21,570
not do not tolerate limited maximum

1418
01:31:16,890 --> 01:31:23,070
loads now about the measure just a

1419
01:31:21,570 --> 01:31:26,460
minute give me a minute and I'll stop

1420
01:31:23,070 --> 01:31:29,190
okay everything that has been said is

1421
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:32,400
right Shannon is here and Shannon wasn't

1422
01:31:29,190 --> 01:31:35,570
the only one who said okay we'll try to

1423
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:37,799
take objective eyes knowledge

1424
01:31:35,570 --> 01:31:39,809
information being objective eyes

1425
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:41,670
knowledge for as date I'm not going to

1426
01:31:39,810 --> 01:31:43,770
repeat myself so we'll try to measure it

1427
01:31:41,670 --> 01:31:47,060
actually it was measuring and the size

1428
01:31:43,770 --> 01:31:49,470
of data not information to measures

1429
01:31:47,060 --> 01:31:52,010
structure on statistical oh you know

1430
01:31:49,470 --> 01:31:55,200
that whoever has engineering education

1431
01:31:52,010 --> 01:31:58,500
knows that from the University about

1432
01:31:55,200 --> 01:32:03,139
twenty to thirty years ago this measure

1433
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:06,330
started being developed the measure of

1434
01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:08,130
content actually it's about the

1435
01:32:06,330 --> 01:32:10,950
applicability of information directions

1436
01:32:08,130 --> 01:32:13,860
when this information allows you to

1437
01:32:10,950 --> 01:32:16,670
improve the outcome of your actions

1438
01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:19,530
these

1439
01:32:16,670 --> 01:32:22,079
coefficients are growing basically it's

1440
01:32:19,530 --> 01:32:27,768
about the effectiveness of information

1441
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:30,929
but we refuse both we or why because

1442
01:32:27,769 --> 01:32:33,179
they're not normalized they're not

1443
01:32:30,929 --> 01:32:38,369
normalized between zero and one they're

1444
01:32:33,179 --> 01:32:42,599
not connected to the true measure and

1445
01:32:38,369 --> 01:32:46,728
without truth as the ultimate eval here

1446
01:32:42,599 --> 01:32:52,309
this fundamental sequence is not going

1447
01:32:46,729 --> 01:32:55,530
to get to the limit so you can only

1448
01:32:52,309 --> 01:33:00,539
judge by this difference if K is your

1449
01:32:55,530 --> 01:33:02,070
current assessment and T is truth so

1450
01:33:00,539 --> 01:33:04,139
it's only but it's difference you can

1451
01:33:02,070 --> 01:33:05,670
judge how far away you are from truth I

1452
01:33:04,139 --> 01:33:10,559
would rather stop here it's cognitive

1453
01:33:05,670 --> 01:33:12,059
level so we have contacts you can go to

1454
01:33:10,559 --> 01:33:14,489
their websites

1455
01:33:12,059 --> 01:33:20,780
somebody call this heresy others say

1456
01:33:14,489 --> 01:33:25,289
this is the only a right approach okay

1457
01:33:20,780 --> 01:33:28,679
this whole thing is described the third

1458
01:33:25,289 --> 01:33:31,650
paper is already announced has already

1459
01:33:28,679 --> 01:33:38,039
been announced so if you got interested

1460
01:33:31,650 --> 01:33:41,759
by my presentation I suggest you just go

1461
01:33:38,039 --> 01:33:43,409
through these sources get involved and

1462
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:48,059
you're most welcome

1463
01:33:43,409 --> 01:33:49,259
to get on board thank you for your

1464
01:33:48,059 --> 01:33:53,039
attention thank you for your

1465
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:55,769
presentation I think we've got some

1466
01:33:53,039 --> 01:33:57,749
understanding of information data and

1467
01:33:55,769 --> 01:33:59,939
knowledge now as well as the

1468
01:33:57,749 --> 01:34:02,550
understanding that the existing

1469
01:33:59,939 --> 01:34:04,050
information system our processing data

1470
01:34:02,550 --> 01:34:05,729
rather than knowledge or information

1471
01:34:04,050 --> 01:34:08,300
thank you very much for your

1472
01:34:05,729 --> 01:34:12,349
presentation and the final presentation

1473
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:16,040
within the time allowed to us is called

1474
01:34:12,349 --> 01:34:18,199
transformation of the mechanism of

1475
01:34:16,040 --> 01:34:20,400
[Music]

1476
01:34:18,199 --> 01:34:27,780
experience use

1477
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:32,138
mr. machine all the presentation here

1478
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:37,090
were quite theoretical and let me just

1479
01:34:32,139 --> 01:34:41,290
give you a down-to-earth version because

1480
01:34:37,090 --> 01:34:42,820
I actually will be referring to every

1481
01:34:41,290 --> 01:34:47,769
previous presenter even to your

1482
01:34:42,820 --> 01:34:50,320
presentation when you said that you are

1483
01:34:47,770 --> 01:34:53,440
sharing the Davos forum position

1484
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:56,199
everything is done in manufacturer

1485
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:58,809
actually digitization is a universal

1486
01:34:56,199 --> 01:35:03,040
mechanism as opposed to making

1487
01:34:58,810 --> 01:35:04,869
mechanical machines digitization is

1488
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:10,949
going to change everything rather than

1489
01:35:04,869 --> 01:35:16,509
just heavy manufacturing Laney said that

1490
01:35:10,949 --> 01:35:19,138
there are no digital twins in law in

1491
01:35:16,510 --> 01:35:22,540
America whereas the State Duma here

1492
01:35:19,139 --> 01:35:24,040
works following the principle of the

1493
01:35:22,540 --> 01:35:26,679
more the better and therefore you have

1494
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:29,139
eight thousand laws now and whatever you

1495
01:35:26,679 --> 01:35:32,199
do you're going to break something I'm

1496
01:35:29,139 --> 01:35:35,860
talking about the legal system so is the

1497
01:35:32,199 --> 01:35:38,440
law for legal entity for a digital twin

1498
01:35:35,860 --> 01:35:41,710
in the US nobody's trying even to do

1499
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:44,290
that because the law is such a thing

1500
01:35:41,710 --> 01:35:47,349
that they follow the precedent based law

1501
01:35:44,290 --> 01:35:52,570
we follow the Roman law and nobody tries

1502
01:35:47,349 --> 01:35:54,940
to digitize it well for me it's them for

1503
01:35:52,570 --> 01:36:02,049
you perhaps there's something else okay

1504
01:35:54,940 --> 01:36:04,480
I am trying to get back to earth because

1505
01:36:02,050 --> 01:36:09,040
a theory is important but let's take a

1506
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:11,980
look at the difference between data

1507
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:15,760
information in all industries data is

1508
01:36:11,980 --> 01:36:17,619
data the intelligence data experiment

1509
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:19,929
data and only IT you have too much

1510
01:36:17,619 --> 01:36:21,820
information including other words

1511
01:36:19,929 --> 01:36:25,139
information technologists saying is the

1512
01:36:21,820 --> 01:36:26,650
wrong name because they just you know

1513
01:36:25,139 --> 01:36:30,540
processing data

1514
01:36:26,650 --> 01:36:30,540
why did they call it information

1515
01:36:31,180 --> 01:36:41,720
the culture has been lost yeah you can

1516
01:36:36,350 --> 01:36:47,510
use that explanation so I propose the

1517
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:51,470
following explanation based on my

1518
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:53,630
personal experience because when they

1519
01:36:51,470 --> 01:36:57,530
talk about digital twins it sounds great

1520
01:36:53,630 --> 01:37:00,530
but I spent about 20 years to make sure

1521
01:36:57,530 --> 01:37:08,330
that digital twins should be considered

1522
01:37:00,530 --> 01:37:11,170
as true to a reality because which

1523
01:37:08,330 --> 01:37:14,059
models we had were always different so

1524
01:37:11,170 --> 01:37:17,210
digital twin is being present as a

1525
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:20,060
panacea as a silver bullet and it's good

1526
01:37:17,210 --> 01:37:22,730
that there are some people who have the

1527
01:37:20,060 --> 01:37:24,770
understanding because the way it usually

1528
01:37:22,730 --> 01:37:30,889
works somebody says digital twin and

1529
01:37:24,770 --> 01:37:33,710
everything becomes a seer starts looking

1530
01:37:30,890 --> 01:37:36,950
simple whereas the relationship between

1531
01:37:33,710 --> 01:37:39,800
digital twin and the reality is a bigger

1532
01:37:36,950 --> 01:37:43,870
question so what else has been said

1533
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:46,490
today is about human experience the

1534
01:37:43,870 --> 01:37:48,440
conversion of data information then on

1535
01:37:46,490 --> 01:37:50,269
to knowledge whereas experience is

1536
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:52,190
something there's being human later very

1537
01:37:50,270 --> 01:37:57,500
company of reorganization so I think

1538
01:37:52,190 --> 01:37:59,929
that we should define data as a set of

1539
01:37:57,500 --> 01:38:03,890
symbols for instance a an instruction

1540
01:37:59,930 --> 01:38:08,780
has been issued you read it as a career

1541
01:38:03,890 --> 01:38:16,460
path step for me and for me it is the

1542
01:38:08,780 --> 01:38:18,410
next step step to resignation so

1543
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:20,300
everybody's interpreting this

1544
01:38:18,410 --> 01:38:22,870
information their own way I call it

1545
01:38:20,300 --> 01:38:26,150
Verity of information and there is

1546
01:38:22,870 --> 01:38:29,599
deterministic information which we

1547
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:31,820
generate during business processes in

1548
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:34,550
that case is your personal

1549
01:38:31,820 --> 01:38:37,730
interpretation always puts you in the

1550
01:38:34,550 --> 01:38:40,070
wrong position but it turns out

1551
01:38:37,730 --> 01:38:43,400
that the regulations are built in such a

1552
01:38:40,070 --> 01:38:45,950
way you you can't do that make it so

1553
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:50,269
that everything should be determined so

1554
01:38:45,950 --> 01:38:52,790
they put a gun on the table and tell you

1555
01:38:50,270 --> 01:38:56,180
please open me an account which a

1556
01:38:52,790 --> 01:38:59,660
regulation you're going to use of course

1557
01:38:56,180 --> 01:39:00,800
see if the customer has a gun then you

1558
01:38:59,660 --> 01:39:05,650
do whatever they say

1559
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:09,980
so this is the way I represented this

1560
01:39:05,650 --> 01:39:13,339
diagram from we know from Cisco so data

1561
01:39:09,980 --> 01:39:17,900
being raw materials and wisdom being at

1562
01:39:13,340 --> 01:39:22,850
the top of the pyramid so I'm referring

1563
01:39:17,900 --> 01:39:28,420
to this model because we all respect

1564
01:39:22,850 --> 01:39:32,960
Cisco as a company but I believe that if

1565
01:39:28,420 --> 01:39:35,300
we apply the same considerations are to

1566
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:39,370
an organization it will turn out that

1567
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:42,620
now everything is focused on regulations

1568
01:39:39,370 --> 01:39:47,989
more developed organizations get focused

1569
01:39:42,620 --> 01:39:50,800
on rules but it would be much better if

1570
01:39:47,989 --> 01:39:53,839
instead of a thousand laws you would be

1571
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:54,910
founding your operations on a few

1572
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:58,280
principles

1573
01:39:54,910 --> 01:40:01,639
so therefore this self organization that

1574
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:03,889
senior was talking about when she met on

1575
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:06,140
metal brought mandelbrot in his fractal

1576
01:40:03,890 --> 01:40:07,820
geometry actually started with this it's

1577
01:40:06,140 --> 01:40:13,510
all about self-organization in a

1578
01:40:07,820 --> 01:40:16,670
corporation so I believe that these

1579
01:40:13,510 --> 01:40:19,160
similar these things may look a similar

1580
01:40:16,670 --> 01:40:25,400
but they're really different so this is

1581
01:40:19,160 --> 01:40:27,170
actually an explanation of the fact that

1582
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:30,139
the Verity of interpretation and

1583
01:40:27,170 --> 01:40:32,420
deterministic interpretations quite

1584
01:40:30,140 --> 01:40:33,739
often opposed saying that they're

1585
01:40:32,420 --> 01:40:36,770
different things but actually they're

1586
01:40:33,739 --> 01:40:39,669
not different it's just that the Verity

1587
01:40:36,770 --> 01:40:44,530
of approach lies at the bottom and

1588
01:40:39,670 --> 01:40:47,360
deterministic on top in a well-organized

1589
01:40:44,530 --> 01:40:49,090
production there are always gaps where

1590
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:50,559
you just don't know

1591
01:40:49,090 --> 01:40:53,680
or white sports where you don't know

1592
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:57,280
which approach to apply Verity of or

1593
01:40:53,680 --> 01:41:06,660
deterministic and then you get this

1594
01:40:57,280 --> 01:41:06,660
field as you the way I called it the

1595
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:24,880
rectangle of threats to goals so these

1596
01:41:18,460 --> 01:41:26,830
strategies in their totality say that we

1597
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:30,040
don't have a strategy but as soon as we

1598
01:41:26,830 --> 01:41:37,510
generate the strategy goals appear and

1599
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:44,260
threats emerge so usually these a threat

1600
01:41:37,510 --> 01:41:47,440
to triangles is drawn in the space of

1601
01:41:44,260 --> 01:41:58,690
damages and probability and I am drawing

1602
01:41:47,440 --> 01:42:05,769
it in the space of a problem of these

1603
01:41:58,690 --> 01:42:14,889
parameters so this axis here looks like

1604
01:42:05,770 --> 01:42:18,280
Riemann sphere so upward here special

1605
01:42:14,890 --> 01:42:20,350
chances so that we shouldn't have a

1606
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:27,040
connection with probability chances

1607
01:42:20,350 --> 01:42:29,440
sounds more neutral so it appears that

1608
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:31,300
when people are taking the same making

1609
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:33,570
decisions what I call a Verity of

1610
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:36,970
interpretation so you give this data set

1611
01:42:33,570 --> 01:42:40,900
then interpretation each one having

1612
01:42:36,970 --> 01:42:44,590
their own here the person can make a

1613
01:42:40,900 --> 01:42:47,650
decision either to take under advisement

1614
01:42:44,590 --> 01:42:50,980
or to make an action and then going to

1615
01:42:47,650 --> 01:42:53,469
the threat triangle to see if there's a

1616
01:42:50,980 --> 01:42:54,719
regulation to that and then they see for

1617
01:42:53,470 --> 01:42:58,500
instance that they

1618
01:42:54,720 --> 01:43:02,040
for that or the regulation says that you

1619
01:42:58,500 --> 01:43:04,290
need to purchase these things after the

1620
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:07,080
competition whereas they need to

1621
01:43:04,290 --> 01:43:09,000
purchase this so they have to make an ad

1622
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:12,000
hoc decision so this is the schematic of

1623
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:16,770
how it really happens so this is an

1624
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:20,220
ideal information so this is the

1625
01:43:16,770 --> 01:43:22,620
information that comes in including you

1626
01:43:20,220 --> 01:43:24,690
know corporate communications memos and

1627
01:43:22,620 --> 01:43:27,990
things and available data gets either

1628
01:43:24,690 --> 01:43:30,780
here or in this fear of regulation and

1629
01:43:27,990 --> 01:43:33,150
here the information is generated and

1630
01:43:30,780 --> 01:43:36,150
here shouldn't even be generated because

1631
01:43:33,150 --> 01:43:38,549
a regulations stipulate what actions you

1632
01:43:36,150 --> 01:43:40,469
need to take so decision made based on

1633
01:43:38,550 --> 01:43:42,510
data if you get a different idea than

1634
01:43:40,470 --> 01:43:48,210
you get in this area and upper two

1635
01:43:42,510 --> 01:43:51,420
recently the border was here and so all

1636
01:43:48,210 --> 01:43:55,200
information was based on regulations

1637
01:43:51,420 --> 01:43:57,330
whereas any ad hoc decisions were to be

1638
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:59,730
made by humans but now the situation is

1639
01:43:57,330 --> 01:44:04,530
changing artificial intelligence

1640
01:43:59,730 --> 01:44:08,009
got here to the human side and this

1641
01:44:04,530 --> 01:44:12,900
whole picture changed and this entails

1642
01:44:08,010 --> 01:44:16,080
risks because here you can't suspect so

1643
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:20,700
happiness or formulate the happiness you

1644
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:24,740
can get from AI so we have this item

1645
01:44:20,700 --> 01:44:28,590
three artificial intelligence I think

1646
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:31,559
what happened with Boeing 737 max the

1647
01:44:28,590 --> 01:44:35,790
pilot was fighting a I didn't win that's

1648
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:40,080
why the plane crashed and people died so

1649
01:44:35,790 --> 01:44:45,450
the emergent intelligence can play a

1650
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:48,990
positive role when AI prompts people in

1651
01:44:45,450 --> 01:44:52,559
the company how to solve a problem this

1652
01:44:48,990 --> 01:44:56,090
is a good example so a human may not

1653
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:58,940
cope with the

1654
01:44:56,090 --> 01:45:02,909
assignments but there are also problems

1655
01:44:58,940 --> 01:45:08,070
when a is wind act in a prescriptive way

1656
01:45:02,909 --> 01:45:17,239
and then humans just can't make what

1657
01:45:08,070 --> 01:45:21,570
they feel right so every oil production

1658
01:45:17,239 --> 01:45:29,638
site now has AI involved and see new

1659
01:45:21,570 --> 01:45:33,539
areas of action appears so a initial

1660
01:45:29,639 --> 01:45:39,170
arises of these a is exchanging data

1661
01:45:33,539 --> 01:45:42,690
between themselves because one sites

1662
01:45:39,170 --> 01:45:47,280
might be more trade than the other and

1663
01:45:42,690 --> 01:45:49,829
they can already identify the failures

1664
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:52,228
the possible failures so they need to

1665
01:45:49,829 --> 01:45:58,558
exchange to maintain the integrity of

1666
01:45:52,229 --> 01:46:03,809
management this is what I think so what

1667
01:45:58,559 --> 01:46:06,780
I'm saying is that if the extractions

1668
01:46:03,809 --> 01:46:10,139
the oil sites oil rigs work separately

1669
01:46:06,780 --> 01:46:12,360
and there's no information exchange I'm

1670
01:46:10,139 --> 01:46:18,570
running I'm going to run risks of losing

1671
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:22,728
control because of the regulation he

1672
01:46:18,570 --> 01:46:22,728
need to be applied everyone everywhere

1673
01:46:23,329 --> 01:46:26,329
uniformly

1674
01:46:34,780 --> 01:46:40,610
so that's basically it everything I want

1675
01:46:37,849 --> 01:46:46,010
to say thank you thank you for your

1676
01:46:40,610 --> 01:46:48,768
presentation so panel is now coming to

1677
01:46:46,010 --> 01:46:51,019
an end we only have two or three minutes

1678
01:46:48,769 --> 01:46:53,869
I just like to remind you that the topic

1679
01:46:51,019 --> 01:46:56,750
of our roundtable discussion was quoted

1680
01:46:53,869 --> 01:46:58,369
as digital information transition from

1681
01:46:56,750 --> 01:47:00,500
the economy of knowledge to digital

1682
01:46:58,369 --> 01:47:02,150
government I'm hoping that within the

1683
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:04,340
two hours allowed to us we managed to

1684
01:47:02,150 --> 01:47:05,960
analyze the subject of course we didn't

1685
01:47:04,340 --> 01:47:07,369
find answers to all questions but at

1686
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:09,980
least we'll get closer to the

1687
01:47:07,369 --> 01:47:13,730
understanding of the essence and the

1688
01:47:09,980 --> 01:47:16,280
field saying that modern digital

1689
01:47:13,730 --> 01:47:18,320
technologies processed data whereas the

1690
01:47:16,280 --> 01:47:23,119
knowledge that we need to operate within

1691
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:26,650
the era of knowledge economy required in

1692
01:47:23,119 --> 01:47:29,239
new understandings and new mechanisms

1693
01:47:26,650 --> 01:47:30,920
for the human civilization I would like

1694
01:47:29,239 --> 01:47:34,959
to bring your attention once again to

1695
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:38,239
the fact that the area of understanding

1696
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:42,610
or the understanding of the very essence

1697
01:47:38,239 --> 01:47:44,989
of information as such what it is the

1698
01:47:42,610 --> 01:47:48,139
this with a complete understanding

1699
01:47:44,989 --> 01:47:52,669
understanding of this is absent now as

1700
01:47:48,139 --> 01:47:58,480
and as philosophers we need to take

1701
01:47:52,670 --> 01:48:01,300
count of two basic positions as the

1702
01:47:58,480 --> 01:48:07,070
crossing of companies is understanding

1703
01:48:01,300 --> 01:48:09,710
the specificity of digitally the economy

1704
01:48:07,070 --> 01:48:11,570
of knowledge will help us understand the

1705
01:48:09,710 --> 01:48:14,840
problem in addressed thank you for your

1706
01:48:11,570 --> 01:48:17,179
attention if you have any question I

1707
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:20,559
believe you can ask them to every

1708
01:48:17,179 --> 01:48:20,559
speaker one on one
