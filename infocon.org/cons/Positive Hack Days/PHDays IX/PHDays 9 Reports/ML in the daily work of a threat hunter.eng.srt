00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,599
the item appears to nation' over speaker

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,919
Alexia Turanian II

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:14,490
avada Claude a - was betrayed hunter

4
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:16,079
spasiba receivables sure as what you

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,020
sittin excetera nunca era boot of

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:23,810
Campania Microsoft at which as a

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:27,920
standard corporate exec AIESEC of Iran

8
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:31,169
Kira and so the first thing I want to

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,719
download it there is a link or just QR

10
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:37,559
code so you don't need just to take any

11
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,300
screenshots and take pictures and there

12
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,489
is much much much convenient just

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,890
downloaded and then and then you can

14
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:49,260
follow it together with me no need just

15
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:51,660
to take screenshots and I'm not sure

16
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:56,699
that well here you can you can read it

17
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:58,919
there by QR code but link so we talk

18
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:03,239
about machine learning for threat

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:06,650
hunters because Microsoft actually has

20
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:10,110
to become a security vendor because

21
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:12,479
they're so large so big so many sites

22
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,140
objects assets that we need to secure

23
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:20,820
and then this this was the only way out

24
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:23,970
and that is why every every month we

25
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:27,330
have lots of events from different

26
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:30,539
sources from our own from from

27
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:34,229
on-premise objects from our customers

28
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,729
partners and and to deal with all this

29
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:37,890
without machine learning would be

30
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:40,439
impossible even 10 years ago it would

31
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,130
have been impossible machine learning

32
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:45,509
we've been using for a long time

33
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:49,210
[Music]

34
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:53,229
it'll be a general presentation yeah

35
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:55,960
don't wait for any machine learning I

36
00:01:53,229 --> 00:02:00,429
will just give you a general general

37
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:02,199
view big picture just will so I will

38
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:06,759
just talk how just too tough to make the

39
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:09,399
first step on the way to machine

40
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:13,150
learning so one example just for the

41
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:18,160
company so what we came up against so

42
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:21,040
they so how does the so then so then

43
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,950
entrance unauthorized entrance and how

44
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,989
to catch so where they want just you to

45
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,940
break us and and where they're just

46
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:30,880
trying just to and when there is no

47
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:34,180
malice and premeditation and this is it

48
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:40,920
even inside Microsoft as a company so

49
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:43,720
but the 280 million yeah ligands a day

50
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,480
so that were regard is anonymous and

51
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:50,500
that required special attention of

52
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:53,200
security analysts to do is so maybe it's

53
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,480
impossible by hand so that's why once we

54
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,670
applied machine learning so the the

55
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,130
amount of events went down dramatically

56
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:02,078
but the simple correlation where the

57
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,630
person so which restaurants he visits

58
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:08,200
where he goes what the business trips he

59
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:10,060
takes and etc acceptance a immediately

60
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,869
there's we managed to bring it down to

61
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,440
almost zero

62
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:17,440
the number of against that we considered

63
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,900
a dangerous so we just reduce the number

64
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,200
of events and we need to respond right

65
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,560
away

66
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:26,500
so then fusion fusion so the security

67
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,120
security graph actually so that from

68
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,739
different sources just looks at

69
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,370
different events from different angles

70
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:35,870
and so for example the number of events

71
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:39,200
the billions a year

72
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:42,980
and so then the different infrastructure

73
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:47,299
and the identity is so mirroring so it

74
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:52,940
civilians and we need to protect our

75
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:55,010
customers so we give them to several

76
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:57,230
machine learning models and then

77
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:59,690
connecting to different sources with

78
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:01,010
tried threat intelligence that way they

79
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:03,879
know the information that we know from

80
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:06,590
our partners in reaching it

81
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:09,620
communicating eventually will come to an

82
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:13,280
average weighted approach that you can

83
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:16,220
see here so this number of events

84
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,228
eventually we narrow it down for some

85
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,840
customers narrowed that that when they

86
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:23,360
need to be responded as so just by

87
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:27,080
Microsoft so they're because we're

88
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,110
afraid of compromising so then using

89
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:32,750
your own signature you'll see that that

90
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:36,320
the customer can be compromised and need

91
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:40,039
to take drastic action and we as a

92
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,919
company how we use machine learning get

93
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:46,010
detection detection fashion everything

94
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:48,460
so you just watch the Security Center

95
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:52,639
events are collected automated

96
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:55,789
automatically collected evaluated and

97
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,919
then so then we have the routes that we

98
00:04:55,789 --> 00:05:00,110
can apply and protect you infrastructure

99
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,770
so you think that there is a minor

100
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:07,430
somewhere launched enter so then

101
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:10,039
and we have events that that come up on

102
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:12,650
the basis of our machine learning that

103
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:17,509
on the basis of the events in the

104
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:19,818
network applications behave so we build

105
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:21,560
this big picture so I know this traffic

106
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,289
we have always had this traffic there is

107
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:30,139
a new traffic that requires my attention

108
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:40,789
investigation immediately does

109
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:44,539
production different virtual virtual

110
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:46,400
networks public networks connecting at

111
00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:48,770
the endpoints we connect the machine

112
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,900
learning see the traffic and they will

113
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:53,750
see how the customers receive it and so

114
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:56,150
how they're busy and somehow they behave

115
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:58,819
the hair of patterns are identified so

116
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:02,120
what is the composition of thick thick

117
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:04,699
lights mobilizes all this is processed

118
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,250
advanced way we do the DDoS for your

119
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:11,270
attention additional capacity opens up

120
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:14,409
and and then the switches start to the

121
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,409
firewall start to come

122
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:36,540
we use it the vendor independent

123
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:39,409
presentation of how we need to do and it

124
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:43,320
does not mean that you that you cannot

125
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:46,260
that you cannot implement it another as

126
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:49,590
fierce or do we don't have it another

127
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:53,159
companies so you can always say so what

128
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:54,960
what is it that we're all the security

129
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,780
operations you know lots of events a

130
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,620
gigantic number of as a predator to

131
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:03,719
process and it has no boss services new

132
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,510
new server so we need to connect in your

133
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:10,250
data and we need to worship the monitor

134
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:18,659
is off so then we have embedded models

135
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:23,190
in built models solutions built-in

136
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:25,500
models as an aggregation sometimes you

137
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:28,490
would have this spikes here so sometimes

138
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:31,530
this links the data to set the servers

139
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:33,840
and they collect Kaspersky so when the

140
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:37,159
end behavior of the file is not done by

141
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:40,130
by a certain machine but that

142
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:43,260
enhancement enhancement algorithm

143
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:46,469
applied to see an open analytics every

144
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:48,960
weather caster so the functions that

145
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,610
were written in the library for us so

146
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:55,620
they are available and we're using them

147
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:59,670
and then the next one is the majority

148
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:02,070
the desire they are the customers to do

149
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:04,740
their own model so police raised raise

150
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:06,360
your hands those who want to play with

151
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,820
the big data and machine learning of the

152
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,950
basis of your own security events who

153
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:15,030
would like to take care of it

154
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:18,210
and that other here those are those any

155
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:18,479
of those who managed to do that who did

156
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,580
it

157
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:29,220
yes so you'll tell us later how you

158
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:35,970
managed to do that and what and what are

159
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:37,740
you doing for that so you see many

160
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:39,990
people are ready to do their own

161
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:47,070
security they want just to try to do

162
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:49,650
this machine learning have done how many

163
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:54,420
managed to bring it on why they can't do

164
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:56,300
that learning beautiful when you start

165
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:59,520
doing it it's not as beautiful as

166
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:09,030
cutting security command the commands of

167
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:12,480
the there's no data scientists cannot

168
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:14,610
afford this security and then the

169
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:19,050
issuer's kafka hadoop what kind of

170
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:20,400
platform to use so that's so whatever

171
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,990
you want to start with you need this

172
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,170
platform you need to put it together you

173
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:27,390
need to serve it you need to log it you

174
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,589
know get some onions and you need to get

175
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:32,189
something and you don't know what you're

176
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:42,750
gonna get maybe to adjust a waste of

177
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:45,900
time and spend budget try to do for the

178
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:48,480
customers we looked at the history

179
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:50,610
distro there are many companies and so

180
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,490
but I cannot afford machine learning so

181
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:58,840
that give them something standard

182
00:09:54,490 --> 00:10:03,480
methods so with it we did a connector X

183
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:06,730
park as your as your native brakes park

184
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,680
notebook Jupiter so we do that if you

185
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,990
look at the security over it to the

186
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:17,050
customer so then during the first stage

187
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:22,030
we so by using some machine learning

188
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:28,930
finished out-of-the-box solutions will

189
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:31,480
launch them and then it works so then

190
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:34,359
where is search queries etc that

191
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:37,960
built-in built-in machine learning model

192
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,780
and our little training and then the

193
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:44,410
next level the next layer once we have

194
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:46,959
this built in ml Calgary applause custom

195
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:50,050
trained model and they so go and use

196
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:52,770
them at the second and the next so we we

197
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:56,229
do our old models and there so and

198
00:10:52,770 --> 00:11:04,000
sometimes we build your own microsoft

199
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:07,450
template running we don't need anyone

200
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:16,960
and there's a Hadoop Kafka whatever and

201
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:21,850
do everything for ourselves so how can

202
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:24,070
we so follow this path as fast as

203
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:26,050
possible so there are two approaches

204
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:28,510
first is built in a machine learning

205
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:33,040
models its first approach built in

206
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:37,330
machine learning and and the second is

207
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:40,569
in more advanced a support of building

208
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:42,940
your own machinery because the current

209
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:45,820
the current vendor say socks iam they

210
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:47,950
don't have to follow the number of

211
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:53,050
customers doesn't want to transform

212
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:54,690
security to because they have no other

213
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:58,030
choice

214
00:11:54,690 --> 00:12:03,850
normal eyes so many events from

215
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:11,890
different sources so there is products

216
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:17,850
etc so let's scratch the surface and see

217
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:23,400
the screenshots I want to just do a demo

218
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:23,400
stable and I decided to do screenshots

219
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:35,070
the first built in the machine learning

220
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:53,439
as well we do have some cases so that

221
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:55,870
the rules so then for example there is

222
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,290
some activity for example others

223
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:01,660
dangerous activity right so we wrote the

224
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:03,310
rules and we know that it actually so

225
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,230
triggered all for the specific server

226
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:07,900
you won't understand what else is

227
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:11,110
connected so if we switch over to this

228
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:13,810
driver which is fusion

229
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:16,540
that gets all the data and responds and

230
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:18,670
this reflects what was happening so then

231
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:22,000
there is an incident that started all

232
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:29,290
and the user and the machine where it's

233
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,940
happened then we go further and they use

234
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:34,209
the tabs and go further and further

235
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:37,510
deeper deeper so there's an additional

236
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:39,880
sign is there something else there the

237
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:43,380
analyst says goes and looks at it it

238
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:46,750
could be a security alert that would be

239
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:51,850
they should be queries depending on the

240
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:55,510
object is being changed doing two clicks

241
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:59,110
and we can see that it all started out

242
00:13:55,510 --> 00:14:09,100
with anonymous alert and there is

243
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:13,090
suspicious activity so we see at which

244
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:18,310
posts so whereas the attack went to and

245
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:23,230
we see it all and so that's a good

246
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:26,410
example that's available the

247
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:29,170
presentation so that's the first example

248
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:41,260
so then built in machine learning that

249
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:44,380
the customers so there's more

250
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:47,380
Diagnostics on the basis and the basis

251
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,630
of logins their loss events security

252
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:54,350
event

253
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:54,350
so them so they could be lots of the

254
00:14:54,470 --> 00:15:00,660
infrastructure they have three gigabyte

255
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:03,300
their gig of my devices so them 30

256
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:05,219
gigabytes away and at certain points in

257
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,140
time to understand what the hell is

258
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,330
going on is impossible if there is

259
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:11,910
anything that is worth thinking it very

260
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:14,340
difficult that's why we have this engine

261
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:17,010
smart Diagnostics what does it does so

262
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:21,150
every time you've built any queries and

263
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:24,960
it compares them and says look this

264
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:26,520
suspicious activity here the engine does

265
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:31,680
not know what kind of so do you know

266
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:34,170
what kind of suspicious alert sugar to

267
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:39,959
the suspicious activity and it starts

268
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:45,360
building starts creating search query

269
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:49,440
and tries to figure out what kind of

270
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:52,740
suspicion there is another one for

271
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:57,210
example further there is more suspicious

272
00:15:52,740 --> 00:16:00,180
activity so we drill down sorry another

273
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:06,510
alert a specific application specific

274
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:08,880
user specific location that's exactly

275
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:12,180
what the engine from the logs found

276
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:14,700
immediately without any without any any

277
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:17,760
any line of code from me just did it all

278
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:20,100
by itself so that the suspicion stop

279
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:23,880
there so something untoward happening

280
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:26,460
still happening and then it ends up it

281
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,960
tells you so they hear these events

282
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:32,130
that's exactly they

283
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:38,760
out of control can provides the the

284
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:38,760
searchlights you and in our Sam Sam

285
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:47,560
where we see the specific logs in the

286
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:50,709
art menu 40 43 43 accounts specific

287
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:54,790
people specific time a specific IP

288
00:16:50,709 --> 00:17:02,729
address and then we as hunters can

289
00:16:54,790 --> 00:17:06,399
follow up on them machine learning helps

290
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:18,329
the next the next in neural networks

291
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:18,329
nearly who loves neural networks I know

292
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:46,330
when I work with logs so neuron just

293
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:48,550
responds for you Windows application

294
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:51,669
systems firewall so anything that you

295
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:55,000
can get your hands on inside inside the

296
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:57,400
event you don't parse it because when

297
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,360
the pattern and parsing matter that the

298
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:02,260
vendor gave us

299
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:05,709
he says if it's a log or some of another

300
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:08,400
vendors log so then we do something new

301
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,400
so with ourselves

302
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,420
forget the user out of this big message

303
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,420
field

304
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:31,250
extract from fields from data so you

305
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:33,320
launch this window and we filter on your

306
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:36,070
network so for your network so the

307
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:45,470
better you filter the better it works

308
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:49,240
the less garbage this is basic

309
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:52,790
filtration basically basic electricity

310
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:57,230
population and event ID thank you that I

311
00:18:52,790 --> 00:19:03,440
want to parse so then try to again the

312
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:04,790
report parameter Windows Update it's

313
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,590
called special menu

314
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:10,639
you've got the special menu this field

315
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:12,949
will be cold like this so then you then

316
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,250
you get it to neural network and an

317
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:18,650
answer is yeah automatically parsed

318
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:22,160
parsed information with all the fields

319
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:25,160
that the neural networks found so

320
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,500
weaknesses and strengths because we

321
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,190
which rained it on our engines other

322
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,130
engine

323
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:33,230
and so then is different locks change

324
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:37,550
the field started to shift something

325
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:40,100
added then this mirror network who have

326
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:42,860
to be retrained retrain work it will

327
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:46,520
work well but not so well and if

328
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:49,219
something goes wrong with the fields and

329
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,480
then so then historic data then your

330
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,549
network does not apply

331
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,889
because it's either a minor traffic

332
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:58,049
sense logs not aggregates but not the

333
00:19:55,889 --> 00:20:01,590
like I said not Dave and not the history

334
00:19:58,049 --> 00:20:28,500
of this information that does not they

335
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:31,590
just well the most interesting placement

336
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:36,090
but open source code because in

337
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:39,269
Microsoft and like open source so we

338
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:42,000
know what we have inside the I just want

339
00:20:39,269 --> 00:20:49,470
to go further one more and we do not

340
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:54,559
want to tie vendor microsoft says yes so

341
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:54,559
there is where is your Peter Newman so

342
00:20:55,130 --> 00:21:07,230
for those who don't it's a special open

343
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:10,320
source to do the description to code by

344
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:13,740
blocks that you can call Bob oblong and

345
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,779
to see the results and then to return to

346
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:20,290
the previous step and then corrected

347
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:26,410
them so why are you using it

348
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:28,930
so just to build new models so for for

349
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:33,690
making a dress and so that to write down

350
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:33,690
the results of investigation because

351
00:21:34,530 --> 00:22:22,740
there's a DM so with all the components

352
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:26,260
there or do they do everything for you

353
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:32,230
fanta so we so we have a published

354
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:35,980
repository hunting command detection the

355
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:38,590
scripts and different models for Jupiter

356
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:40,420
not ourselves and that is why so the

357
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:43,149
link will be at the end of so go visit

358
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:45,610
it and see and even if you are not using

359
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:49,890
our services so are all the same boat

360
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:49,889
motor security and that is

361
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:56,730
each company becomes more secure so it's

362
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:58,860
every company will be happy why should I

363
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:02,310
play with it you can always take it back

364
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:06,600
if you can also then the first thing

365
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:09,780
that we don't we say so I want I want

366
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:19,649
Laputa so this repository we call it we

367
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:22,200
put it in our account what do you want

368
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:26,220
what do you want just free free

369
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:28,410
computers for not the free computers

370
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:33,060
that Microsoft provides for you have

371
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:38,100
your own source for processing so we'll

372
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:41,190
play yes we can play the complimentary

373
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:45,030
or when you need something in production

374
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:48,690
so we shall take up another worker so we

375
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:52,080
have kept our closet or ease we kept our

376
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:54,030
repository and he would drill down so

377
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,189
there will be certain log books that I

378
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:58,950
took the basic notebook this

379
00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:01,590
investigation with Windows most so it

380
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:03,510
looks like this so there's a page on

381
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:18,030
which you can just write the text it can

382
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:21,900
reformat at the links references so then

383
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:23,700
we add the code so then if it's executed

384
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,510
step-by-step you can just launch it

385
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,970
altogether

386
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:29,490
for step-by-step anyone who is asking us

387
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:32,160
some passwords as with everyone together

388
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:34,640
sort over which period of time I saw

389
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:37,520
Danny Pihl process at all

390
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,299
and so then there's certain certainly

391
00:24:37,520 --> 00:25:06,940
year's Python Python plus how queries

392
00:24:40,299 --> 00:25:06,940
and then at the bottom you can see there

393
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:58,940
so we get many events in different

394
00:25:56,030 --> 00:26:01,340
tables of our cm over some period of

395
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:05,460
time and then we start searching again

396
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:09,000
we key in the host name

397
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:17,309
time interval that we want done step by

398
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:20,039
step we may block so we do rerun if you

399
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:22,710
want if we understand that we made a

400
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:25,860
mistake in there we go Feb 1 2 3 blocks

401
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:29,010
back and then launch them again relaunch

402
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:31,408
them the data will come and finally it

403
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:40,830
will give you some results and

404
00:26:31,409 --> 00:26:43,260
visualization visualization connect

405
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:53,100
external libraries so in my case it was

406
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:56,419
just charged tables with graphs when do

407
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:59,100
you want to do the customers use it

408
00:26:56,419 --> 00:27:01,970
during forensic if you do an

409
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:05,070
investigation just like it happens now

410
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:12,929
query to sources you record them

411
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:16,529
somewhere and use to work somehow the

412
00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:19,350
next investigation is difficult to the

413
00:27:16,529 --> 00:27:22,470
next investigation has difficulty

414
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:27,570
finding a code and where is it then

415
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:31,110
Jupiter is good because it gives you a

416
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:33,418
detailed description of an investigation

417
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:36,029
if especially if it's not an incident

418
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:39,120
but you identify something new in your

419
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:42,330
infrastructure that you never knew so

420
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,309
you write down all your ideas text

421
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:46,230
pictures whatever and then the queries

422
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:48,920
at any moment of time you come back to

423
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:52,400
it and keep working

424
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:55,490
you can share in the community and we

425
00:27:52,400 --> 00:28:01,340
appeal and Microsoft prevails please

426
00:27:55,490 --> 00:28:04,070
enrich open-source community and then I

427
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:06,020
shall repeat again so in any case look

428
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:10,399
no matter what products are using look

429
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:14,180
at our cases for linux everything

430
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:16,430
general security you can look at the

431
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:19,430
github and probably you will find

432
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:21,860
something interesting another example

433
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:24,800
adjust because and notebook is good

434
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:31,120
about data breaks as far is better

435
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:36,139
because it's just focus just to play

436
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:40,820
something it says something just like a

437
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:43,190
game but we have a short data bricks

438
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:45,500
please raise your hands if you are

439
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:56,660
familiar with Azure data bricks and spar

440
00:28:45,500 --> 00:29:00,700
Apache spark great big data in a pure

441
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:03,530
sense of the word for you to take and

442
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:06,410
it's not a Microsoft invention it's a

443
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:09,250
partner service that we develop and the

444
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:12,550
initial concept was not from us

445
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:16,660
and it allows you to build a full scale

446
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:20,730
in the Middle's because under the hood

447
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:25,270
all this part of Knology and the things

448
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:27,760
were - shall we do here in our case in

449
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:32,250
the case was that Microsoft provides to

450
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:34,870
the customers so detect anomalies in the

451
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:39,850
access to files for instance we have a

452
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:43,179
company and users have some rights and

453
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:46,409
historically users accumulate rights yes

454
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:50,140
the company should have a process of

455
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:52,060
withdrawing those rights cancelling so

456
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,590
sometimes the companies doesn't have

457
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:55,750
those for sometimes they don't work well

458
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:58,870
so I thought user will get access to

459
00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:02,650
some documents of that well are kind of

460
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:04,810
dangerous to get all now probably at

461
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:07,960
least the company and wants to know that

462
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:09,730
someone turned to those commitments as

463
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,600
there is no better signals that you have

464
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:16,060
a move or a person wanted to leave

465
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:20,020
because when you saw this as a pack of

466
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:23,080
disks or diskettes now flash so if you

467
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:25,780
need only one a small flash drive how

468
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:28,179
can you catch a person who intends to

469
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:31,770
leave and before leaving wants to copy

470
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:34,480
information so certainly you can try to

471
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:40,180
get this information from just from the

472
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:42,640
server but again if if the user is

473
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:46,300
careless it he will do it in one day but

474
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:50,380
if you just spread this activity for one

475
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:55,780
month you will do nothing so what was

476
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:59,580
the model to you you asked for access

477
00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:02,269
and will provide it and then

478
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:07,590
the model will look at the behavior of

479
00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:10,110
users then calculates the scoring point

480
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:17,549
just like when we turn for loans that

481
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:21,090
they immediately they calculate the

482
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:22,739
behavioral profile what files the user

483
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:24,928
self address

484
00:31:22,739 --> 00:31:29,220
how they behave and for instance let me

485
00:31:24,929 --> 00:31:31,859
give you an example all the users what

486
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:38,279
kind of user what users had access to

487
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:43,799
files this access was unusual each and

488
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:45,779
every user to the place where he

489
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:47,730
historical and never went and downloaded

490
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:49,850
something from they it does not mean

491
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:53,690
that it's necessary bad

492
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:58,139
it's a project but if we see so many

493
00:31:53,690 --> 00:32:01,109
such red lines and if we can get the

494
00:31:58,139 --> 00:32:05,729
data the details and correlator to some

495
00:32:01,109 --> 00:32:09,629
other things need access from strange IP

496
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:14,039
addresses later over time in the office

497
00:32:09,629 --> 00:32:17,009
we have much data we can actually become

498
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:19,350
suspicious and build some alerts and the

499
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:22,109
security rules are that we'll say you

500
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:24,719
see we have a strange model behavior

501
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:27,379
model here we have yes it's not that

502
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,379
exactly

503
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:36,449
of sanctions it's just unusual and then

504
00:32:34,139 --> 00:32:41,149
there's something for you to study you

505
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:41,149
can see what's unusual about this access

506
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:48,149
so actually my presentation turned out

507
00:32:45,749 --> 00:32:50,970
to be shoulder they are in standard

508
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:56,939
their self machine learning for security

509
00:32:50,970 --> 00:33:01,070
operations is not painful you have all

510
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:04,590
the tools right now to start trying it

511
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:09,840
it depends on your competences start

512
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:10,320
with your if you don't know where to

513
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,658
start

514
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,178
start with as you or not will be if you

515
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:18,570
want to go further deeper approach me

516
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:20,609
I'll try to get access to the models

517
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:24,450
themselves so that you could start

518
00:33:20,609 --> 00:33:29,340
playing with them in the spark data

519
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:44,549
bridge some useful references first my

520
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:47,869
presentations and in 3:15 at our Jupiter

521
00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:51,179
notebooks free of charge your gesture

522
00:33:47,869 --> 00:33:53,428
login you register and do something that

523
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:56,890
you want to do thank you and happy to

524
00:33:53,429 --> 00:34:00,049
take your questions if you

525
00:33:56,890 --> 00:34:00,049
[Applause]

526
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:09,190
thank you for the presentation I have a

527
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:11,949
strange question could you explain why

528
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:14,260
you use neuron network a window for

529
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:18,158
parsing of the food fields because it's

530
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:20,639
an equivalent of a template and it's a

531
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:24,040
center yeah I understand

532
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:35,109
just because you raise your hands if you

533
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:43,029
don't like regular something I don't

534
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:56,348
like regular activities for the people

535
00:34:43,030 --> 00:35:02,829
like me find something that will parse

536
00:34:56,349 --> 00:35:05,579
this message I am good what if I fail to

537
00:35:02,829 --> 00:35:05,579
do it try

538
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:12,859
[Music]

539
00:35:15,789 --> 00:35:26,299
who cannot do something regular I repeat

540
00:35:20,029 --> 00:35:28,519
I don't believe I can - right no I have

541
00:35:26,299 --> 00:35:38,809
my question is different if you add a

542
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:42,979
field you will need to retrain it what

543
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:45,200
can we use no you don't need to add you

544
00:35:42,979 --> 00:35:51,799
need to retrain the neuron network is

545
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:54,049
just if your address has changed if you

546
00:35:51,799 --> 00:35:59,390
need something else and make another

547
00:35:54,049 --> 00:36:02,809
neuron network in this case you don't

548
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:07,819
need to retrain the neuron network a new

549
00:36:02,809 --> 00:36:18,140
one grid so a question from a person

550
00:36:07,819 --> 00:36:20,269
with big data Thank You Alec see you so

551
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:23,328
you have described a very important

552
00:36:20,269 --> 00:36:27,618
thing my question do you have any ways

553
00:36:23,329 --> 00:36:30,410
to to an honest a good email with

554
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:33,579
breakdown of data set to practicing and

555
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:36,979
work under production and then makeup

556
00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:40,969
user Voser so that the user can accept

557
00:36:36,979 --> 00:36:45,288
or deny and say this is an anomaly or

558
00:36:40,969 --> 00:36:46,880
this this anomaly exists we confirm so

559
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:49,670
for instance you build a model that

560
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:52,789
calculates a normal is then makes a

561
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:55,190
supervised model that separates good so

562
00:36:52,789 --> 00:36:57,969
who do you mean by the user is a

563
00:36:55,190 --> 00:37:02,180
customer or the user in the customer

564
00:36:57,969 --> 00:37:05,719
specific for both if you have API

565
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:08,710
endpoint that allows us to deny an

566
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:13,569
anomaly or maybe

567
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:15,760
so the motto in judo in Jupiter or data

568
00:37:13,569 --> 00:37:19,119
breaks we give to you in case of super

569
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:21,460
it's not okay to do was work and danger

570
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:24,819
break system model that you do we only

571
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:29,500
give you template you can make

572
00:37:24,819 --> 00:37:34,170
exceptions and I think that in Jupiter

573
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:41,829
and sparkle you can do whatever you wish

574
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:46,119
data brick sees are better for that in

575
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:49,480
Jupiter and spark it can be done we are

576
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:53,940
not inventing we stopped at five years

577
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:58,000
ago we take the best and give it to you

578
00:37:53,940 --> 00:38:02,170
in our ever answering the second

579
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:05,170
question like automatic response yes we

580
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:13,299
need to involve users and before we

581
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:18,790
write some detection illogical to ask a

582
00:38:13,299 --> 00:38:20,829
user was it used is better to register

583
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:25,808
as a case in our system because we

584
00:38:20,829 --> 00:38:27,670
started working on it if some audit

585
00:38:25,809 --> 00:38:31,150
welcome we need to see because we have

586
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:33,520
this signal and we fixed it and the mr.

587
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:40,770
Jones means confirmed that it was him or

588
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:40,770
not him we have this traitor

589
00:38:43,049 --> 00:38:50,170
besides code after games that comes from

590
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,720
the business world and for instance in

591
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:55,150
Twitter they say bad things about my

592
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:58,240
company if they - I want the market

593
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:59,770
ologist to get a letter and respond so

594
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,169
that that Twitter

595
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:04,030
and we have a chinois Jakob office

596
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:06,880
floral with many connectors and

597
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:12,940
Microsoft services to Twitter to sapa

598
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:18,120
ABM Facebook whatever you name it you

599
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:18,120
just use workflow from those connectors

600
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:25,750
and you can respond through them we have

601
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:31,870
an attraction we have user name let us

602
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:35,400
send this letter a proof or a check and

603
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:40,980
depending on what the user process we

604
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:46,720
close the incident or keep working on it

605
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:51,160
if the user says no it's not me we work

606
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:53,680
on it if there is a feedback give it to

607
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:59,020
the analytic at some third level data

608
00:39:53,680 --> 00:40:01,930
scientists it's probably under certain

609
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:05,380
line we give it to him as a first line

610
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:08,680
feedback and say that's your model it's

611
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:24,640
lousy it didn't work well we need to fix

612
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:26,140
it there are cases when it can't be done

613
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,140
it should be done because machine

614
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:32,319
learning is not a silver bullet it

615
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:36,400
should be second after you collect all

616
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:38,770
the logs and it should help you identify

617
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,800
those things you have your hard core

618
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:44,380
rules on security groups something else

619
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:46,690
at the same level you have machine

620
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:53,430
learning that looks at other things and

621
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:53,430
says look what I have found question

622
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:03,450
yeah once I'm getting that mine so I

623
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:07,560
wanted to ask about the model protection

624
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:09,930
and machine learning attack - you told

625
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:14,400
many times that this model mundo is

626
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:18,629
accessible you can download the

627
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:21,210
rocketHub models I understand that this

628
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:24,080
is one of the three main vectors of

629
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:29,280
attack to machine learning when a person

630
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:32,250
takes an available model and then he he

631
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,440
will study it and know how to break all

632
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:38,760
other models how do you protect against

633
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:43,200
this is there any procedure kill test or

634
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:45,240
whatever proof of sustainability so you

635
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:48,899
give a model to the client can you tell

636
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:51,419
him you know this model so available to

637
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:55,290
any John Smith but no one has ever

638
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:58,470
broken it because it's impossible thank

639
00:41:55,290 --> 00:42:01,440
you for the Russian the brief answer

640
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:07,290
probably it cannot have a maximum 26

641
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:09,750
percent so we cannot say that this model

642
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:13,759
is impossible to break if people tell

643
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:15,730
you is a lie any things can be broken

644
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:27,130
anything

645
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:29,980
we upload our models to get help and we

646
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:32,829
provide it as a test and this is a good

647
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:34,210
question because the perpetrator if he

648
00:42:32,829 --> 00:42:37,420
is not a fool he will look and

649
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:39,250
understand how this model works but the

650
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:41,260
advantage is that we took this model

651
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:45,910
into the company and keep doing

652
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:47,650
something with it some servers

653
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:48,578
definitely will work in our

654
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:51,099
infrastructure

655
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:57,070
generate noise noise that we don't need

656
00:42:51,099 --> 00:43:00,880
and break the model whatever should

657
00:42:57,070 --> 00:43:07,390
appraise the organizers and the host can

658
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:12,040
that so we still hope that the user will

659
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:13,990
customize the model how do we prevent it

660
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:16,000
from the model point of view this is as

661
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:21,759
usual shield and squirt or whatever

662
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:23,680
whoever is smothers will win so speaking

663
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:26,470
about the protection of infrastructure

664
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:28,990
this is virtual infrastructure with the

665
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:33,848
same recommendations that apply to

666
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:40,240
protect any virtual service it's an

667
00:43:33,849 --> 00:43:43,560
interesting question I cannot say that

668
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:47,859
it is just the case that will work out

669
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:48,990
even if we look at another thing Windows

670
00:43:47,859 --> 00:43:53,200
Update

671
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:56,319
which people study and do export before

672
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:59,649
to make exploit let's be honest not many

673
00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:02,740
team can do it because probably 95% of

674
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:06,460
hackers or those who believe they're

675
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:07,779
hackers are not accepting educated

676
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:10,930
people

677
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:13,690
you just use my first tools and service

678
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:19,930
they paid the money for they bought some

679
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:24,250
framework and started doing something

680
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:27,520
probably in future we shall have to

681
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:30,100
address it but as we need to know which

682
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:37,990
is the one that you use I hope it's not

683
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:42,100
just Microsoft you know there is not

684
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:44,529
much knowledge thank you for the

685
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:46,930
overview and look I have a question

686
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:54,460
about your cases you spoke about detect

687
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:57,299
unusual calls to the files I understand

688
00:44:54,460 --> 00:45:06,700
that you need integration of our network

689
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:11,920
to Azure so does it play there or we

690
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:15,189
just you play or we take something put

691
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:18,760
in our work at networker and yes I

692
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:22,000
understand your question yes if should

693
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:24,850
we speak about the currency Jupiter

694
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:29,830
notebooks that are published they are

695
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:32,770
use our services information and

696
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:35,560
transport no one stops you from changes

697
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:38,560
those data sets for elastic or Adar but

698
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:40,960
in case of Nina is your notebook at the

699
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,910
cloud you will have to open a collect

700
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,950
connection so that the notebook would

701
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:47,560
come and they request that data

702
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:52,330
I would suggest once you want to play

703
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:54,900
that way and would not be ready to have

704
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:59,640
a closed infrastructure just connect

705
00:45:54,900 --> 00:46:02,760
this environment and use it to build

706
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:06,660
this model and then you get it under

707
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:08,190
then you deploy virtual machines and use

708
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:10,920
this notebook but you will need to

709
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:18,600
rewrite the query because you have a

710
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:22,200
different team and it's yours you need

711
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:23,940
to reset the data connectors but you

712
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:28,799
will have at least at the basis the

713
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:31,140
skeleton yes RCM no we cannot give it a

714
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:38,400
weight we are not providing it works as

715
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:41,460
a service security operations should not

716
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:43,860
handle infrastructure you should not

717
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:49,170
have this headache you know about the

718
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:52,110
storage the speed of queries you should

719
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:57,960
just do investigation and forensic and

720
00:46:52,110 --> 00:47:00,810
do something else you should just a show

721
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:04,130
a traffic light with information how

722
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:04,130
good or how bad is that

723
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:25,328
so now you have if you give it to me

724
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:29,220
I'll give it to the people now so much

725
00:47:25,329 --> 00:47:29,220
proposal in Detroit with your permission

726
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:35,890
yes I would like to give it to the

727
00:47:33,099 --> 00:47:43,690
person with big data questions and the

728
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:46,890
second question to you for practical

729
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:46,890
nature of the question
