00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,140
dobroe utro Collegium

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,300
and i'd like to welcome you here pH days

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,250
very pleased to speak the first so that

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:15,630
I can take care about an important

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:18,960
business afterwards I'm so gay and we

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:21,090
have Dennis here with us a short

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,119
introduction and a very Russian person

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,640
currently I'm working in Dubai in Abu

9
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:31,380
Dhabi and I'm teaching in the Hubble

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:34,710
Space University in Barcelona and part

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:37,290
of the committee of the pH days so

12
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,110
that's why they allowed me to speak here

13
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:43,379
it's a bit obsolete that Denis updated

14
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,450
that previously had worked for Kaspersky

15
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:51,000
Labs positive technologies and my

16
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:54,449
hobbies cyber physics systems so an

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:00,440
actually hacking of such systems as it

18
00:00:54,449 --> 00:01:03,089
were and I had been hacking the security

19
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,069
solutions for quite some time everything

20
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,320
which is related to machine learning and

21
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:11,970
artificial intelligence and currently

22
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:18,210
I'm working for the AI University so

23
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:20,610
that's briefly speaking about my my

24
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,220
things so that's the cover of the

25
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,680
magazine that's everything which is

26
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,850
fashionable but from big Bitcoin I'm

27
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:36,659
working full Tomsk State University

28
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:41,460
living in Tomsk and had spent a few

29
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:46,320
weeks developing the sd1 solutions so

30
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:51,860
basically as d1 what is it all about and

31
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:55,169
why did I decided to take care of that

32
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:57,270
people have been hyping this topic for

33
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,189
quite some time saying that this is a

34
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,340
new technology which would replace all

35
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:05,699
the traditional hardware it's very good

36
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:08,429
and very fashionable so what people show

37
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,949
us is that yes it is being implemented

38
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:14,410
quite rapidly and

39
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:17,319
one day I received an order for the

40
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:19,959
development of such a solution before

41
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:22,149
developing something it's pretty trivial

42
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:25,030
you just need to check out some market

43
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:27,099
solutions and decide either you buy it

44
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:31,950
either you partner with someone I would

45
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:35,048
do something on your own so we have to

46
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:38,170
we have to partner with someone so the

47
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:39,970
salespeople had run over and they had to

48
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:43,149
explain that there was a very nice

49
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:46,329
product with which we just need to work

50
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:49,660
and supplied it to them market just some

51
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:51,940
white labeling required then I worked

52
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:55,750
for a little bit and I checked the

53
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:58,060
source cord and I decided no we just

54
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,720
need to take a look at this situation

55
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,049
differently

56
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,599
and there were some guys from Tomsk

57
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:09,220
university that had connected with me

58
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:11,500
and together we hacked all those Sdn

59
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,040
solutions available and the after market

60
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:17,200
just to understand what's inside them

61
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,209
that's basically the whole story could

62
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,530
have easily finished here but I will

63
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:26,049
continue all those Sdn solutions are not

64
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:28,620
just going to replace all the

65
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:31,810
traditional pieces of hardware with

66
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:37,000
artificial intelligence and things like

67
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:43,810
that everything related to that

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:47,380
so basically AI is going to take care of

69
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:51,460
your data streaming and the 5g

70
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:53,500
technology replacing the MPLS there's

71
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:56,170
quite a lot of hype going on around this

72
00:03:53,500 --> 00:04:00,250
topic and everything's going to be nice

73
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:03,760
with 5g these are powerful and safe

74
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:06,670
solutions to say the least at least the

75
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,399
manufacturers tell us about that that

76
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:12,720
they are such solutions so the first

77
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:16,420
thing we did was checking the actual

78
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:20,589
concept of sd1 and basically it looks

79
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:23,560
nice so what would have to invest into

80
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:28,450
it but there was some problem with

81
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:31,090
implementation as always so they were

82
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:33,250
adding and adding new features and some

83
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:36,400
of the features were quite fundamental

84
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:40,210
security wise and design wise and they

85
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:44,890
had not been taken care of in the

86
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:49,270
solutions so the as do when you Hope

87
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:54,130
Project had been living for more than a

88
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:56,830
year since December 2017 to be precise

89
00:04:54,130 --> 00:05:00,820
and this is a project which has been

90
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:04,450
developing new vulnerabilities pop up

91
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:09,159
and new tools which we will speak later

92
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:11,229
so those of you who would like to invest

93
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,390
your hacking mind into this story

94
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:19,570
you're please welcome to contribute your

95
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:22,360
ideas and hack in mind basically it's a

96
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:24,880
pretty boring part of the slides so I

97
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,310
would like to run through it but before

98
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,870
hacking something you just need to

99
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,780
understand what you are hacking

100
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:35,310
not necessarily though so this is the

101
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:38,500
high-level design of Sdn looks like

102
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:41,380
unlike a simple router it is pretty

103
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,540
straightforward here where the packets

104
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,710
are coming here where the packets are

105
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:48,700
going

106
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:50,380
but when we decided to take care of it

107
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:54,010
we just decided to simply hack it

108
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:56,080
without digging deep into it but our

109
00:05:54,010 --> 00:06:01,270
Commission said no no you can't do that

110
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,680
so we decided to take a look whether it

111
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:05,770
works or it doesn't

112
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:09,000
so the first problem we faced is that we

113
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:12,659
made it work we decided to make it work

114
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,880
and this sd1 has a multi-component

115
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:19,090
system it includes a few levels quite a

116
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:23,050
lot of boxes Virtual Box is responsible

117
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:28,030
for virtual tasks so we decided to

118
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:31,030
deploy it before hacking not in the

119
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:34,359
cloud but in the local as a local

120
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:36,250
installation it was not that easy to run

121
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,730
it on premise because it includes quite

122
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:43,720
a lot of components let's talk about the

123
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:48,280
main components at the lower level if we

124
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:52,600
start bottom to top we actually have the

125
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:55,719
router with the router as such this is

126
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:59,440
the device which puts the packets from

127
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:02,110
one interface to another conducting some

128
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,660
security operations over it so it could

129
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:08,490
be balancing the load some other

130
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:11,770
operations so in one device there can be

131
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:15,190
multiple devices of this kind because

132
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:21,310
basically each box is a virtual machine

133
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:25,480
which can be added different virtual

134
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:29,020
network functions then on the next level

135
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:32,500
we have a controller and this controller

136
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:36,909
is responsible for traffic flow

137
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:41,440
management it cascades down the policies

138
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:44,350
to the routers to operate with each

139
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,920
particular interface and manage the

140
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:50,110
packets so they also add some redundancy

141
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,150
so some of the controllers may have a

142
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:55,340
few virtual functions if some of them

143
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:58,669
goes down they may switch between

144
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:01,979
to have some redundancy and so forth

145
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:05,690
it looks pretty logical so now

146
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:08,550
afterwards there follows the level of

147
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:11,700
orchestration the orchestration level is

148
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:15,360
the level where policies has set so for

149
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:19,560
example if we take a standard check

150
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:24,000
point rent mower it would always have an

151
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:26,940
a multiple set of firewalls you just not

152
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,560
run an assist control list you just do

153
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:36,179
some settings on the graphic interface

154
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:41,750
and then depending subsystem depending

155
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:46,800
on these policies up there

156
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:51,000
there may be an orchestration very

157
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,680
global policy some meta policies for

158
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,680
example if you are a provider of

159
00:08:52,680 --> 00:09:01,229
networking services it may be a level

160
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:05,459
with zero touch provisioning ultimately

161
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:10,680
there may be a level where you separate

162
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:22,110
the tenants also it includes different

163
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:35,069
logs it builds up beautiful different

164
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:40,190
from traditional providers one same box

165
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:48,990
may have functions starting from simple

166
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:51,360
virtualization so by using the

167
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:56,070
virtualization technology deployment is

168
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:58,260
simplified you just download in this

169
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,270
blocks a virtual machine or a token

170
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,950
container or you just activate a

171
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:05,390
function and it starts working they're

172
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:08,080
running on the Box it has everything

173
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:10,060
inside

174
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:14,080
something that you really need in a

175
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:17,189
particular situation so these virtual

176
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:22,089
functions implementation can be

177
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:24,459
different it has an SDM built-in HD one

178
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:26,709
each and every vendor decides

179
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:29,619
specifically how they are going to do it

180
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:39,329
so it creates some difficulties with the

181
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:42,339
understanding SD when you can allocate

182
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:45,300
and distribute them to different levels

183
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:49,440
so for instance if we take security

184
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:55,479
there is a need to filter some traffic

185
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:57,130
from malicious content remotely in an

186
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,510
office and a remote office where you

187
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:00,660
don't have a powerful equipment

188
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:07,709
installed you may year is quite simple

189
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:28,839
load managing such functions like IOC

190
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:31,709
and use this indicators but if you see

191
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:34,630
something serious which requires

192
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:38,709
inspection you send it to the HQ with

193
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:42,510
the powerful machines processing some of

194
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:42,510
the information may be

195
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:49,660
processed in the cloud it's a very

196
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:53,590
popular solution these days a cloud

197
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:55,660
solution with more data where dedicated

198
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:59,380
people you just look at their monitors

199
00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:02,319
identify an apt and send in the block

200
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:07,750
lists to you so that's the allocation of

201
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:11,710
the functions basically this concept

202
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:15,010
looks pretty good pretty fashionable and

203
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:45,870
people speak about its security of being

204
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:45,870
very good and even network juniper Hall

205
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:55,990
a cipher you need to decrypt it if it's

206
00:12:52,650 --> 00:13:01,140
encrypted in a proper way you just need

207
00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:03,670
to use some debugging interfaces so you

208
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:07,360
really need to use a soldering device

209
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:10,030
some other hardware but Sdn solutions

210
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:14,310
are different most of these different

211
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:17,560
solutions are virtual ones so as virtual

212
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:20,589
virtual solutions they just demonstrate

213
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:23,890
a binary file which can easily mount it

214
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:26,800
to a file system and the analysis of

215
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:31,660
this security of this system simply

216
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:34,829
turns into acquiring route rights and

217
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:40,240
then handling it you know how it works

218
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:41,420
first you just do the route and do the

219
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,640
hole

220
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:48,630
complicated analysis afterwards we have

221
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:54,600
a very interesting presentation in many

222
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:57,930
conferences I've had it since 2015 and

223
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:04,520
Jeremy brown would say how he would

224
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:06,870
analyze virtual appliances so basically

225
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:12,180
they have quite a lot of simple

226
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:14,550
solutions on how to start with that we

227
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,680
have a virtual machine where you connect

228
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:20,609
to virtual machines and the file system

229
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:24,239
and you start stringing it and normally

230
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:26,160
in 90% of the cases you find the names

231
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:31,980
of the users and some sensitive

232
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:34,410
information which would allow us to get

233
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:37,170
some privileges given by the

234
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:41,219
manufacturer normally the manufacturer

235
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:43,650
would give us the truncated shell and

236
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:51,570
the local vulnerabilities like the non

237
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:54,920
touched Linux and some binary files are

238
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:58,770
present are omnipresent and the remote

239
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:02,160
vulnerabilities in the web services will

240
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:04,110
be explained as well but if all of these

241
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,620
solutions don't really work it's a

242
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:10,339
virtual machine you can come up and

243
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:13,260
replace the shell for your own shell and

244
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:15,540
make your own link of course you just

245
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:19,050
breach the integrity of the system it

246
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:24,390
may cause other consequences but it will

247
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:27,150
suffice to make it work and sometimes it

248
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:30,720
works even simpler it can google this

249
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:34,920
you can google this and google for the

250
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:38,520
manufacturer for the eggs for example a

251
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:41,160
jet hub we found some scripts that can

252
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:45,829
be utilized for the remote management

253
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:48,689
these are the enterprise scripts some of

254
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:51,029
someone was developing it but we just

255
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:53,940
like that with the administrator

256
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:57,720
username and the one-two-three password

257
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:59,670
it turned out to be simple it was used

258
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:03,959
like that every way you can simply log

259
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:06,899
in and use it if you google it the

260
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:12,660
second story and I will be speaking

261
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:15,750
about that more in detail is the level

262
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:17,219
of security is not always high even if

263
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:20,399
the vulnerabilities are patched

264
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:24,120
sometimes the patches are not sufficient

265
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,920
not useful enough for example in 2015

266
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,790
there was this vulnerability published

267
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:33,569
and the vendor reported for having

268
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:37,649
patched that and in 2018 we easily used

269
00:16:33,569 --> 00:16:42,029
that there was a special SPS shell

270
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:46,139
command that you would have to enter in

271
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:52,589
the interface and simply drill down into

272
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:56,600
the root function so definitely googling

273
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:59,730
is pretty useful google is useful to

274
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:03,029
grep for passwords another interesting

275
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:05,159
example you can grab some passwords in a

276
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:07,949
very trivial fashion and sometimes the

277
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:09,959
passwords are trivial that aligned with

278
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:13,740
the vendors name and sometimes they are

279
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:16,980
not and when the hackers would replace

280
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:20,490
the vendor name for some elite hacker

281
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:23,459
name another thing which may be

282
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:26,429
interesting some of these systems are

283
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:28,980
virtual appliances and they pre tuned

284
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:32,900
already for example there is a Linux

285
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,900
given to you which is already running

286
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:45,399
the same things about the logs the same

287
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:49,140
stays there some data can be written

288
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:53,289
there so there is a vlog with a password

289
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:55,510
and they did not wipe it out they just

290
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:59,110
left them there but even if they just

291
00:17:55,510 --> 00:18:01,600
simply deleted that by RM it simply

292
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:06,760
means that they did not so such things

293
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:12,029
are nice forensics to use to do some

294
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:15,490
forensics you can restore some files in

295
00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:19,659
history you can find some deployment

296
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:26,919
scripts there where you would just see

297
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:28,470
the hash hash files are not available to

298
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:31,960
you what they are with the limited share

299
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:35,970
shell but you can simply find them and

300
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:39,669
then use the brute force or some

301
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:45,039
intelligent approach and you don't even

302
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:48,730
need to use plenty of GPU power to brute

303
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:52,230
force it and there are some progress

304
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:56,019
going on so the security solutions

305
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:59,409
developing worldwide and previously all

306
00:18:56,019 --> 00:19:02,950
those Cisco devices with a lowercase

307
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:07,240
uppercase passwords were standard

308
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:10,600
practice nowadays they changing and we

309
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:15,010
can hope for a brighter future and like

310
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:18,870
I was saying if such simple tasks do not

311
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:23,769
work you can always patch you can always

312
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:28,149
have a shell into into C shadow you can

313
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:31,510
replace boot scripts you can replace the

314
00:19:28,149 --> 00:19:36,070
conflicts of the remote management when

315
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:38,940
the password is stored in a no location

316
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:41,470
to you if you know that there is some

317
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,940
authentication required and the you just

318
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:45,320
give the command no authentication

319
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:49,080
required and you drill down

320
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:50,879
or just simply and Linux and put your

321
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:54,090
useful file in there so there are

322
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,070
multiple zillions of options you just

323
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:56,490
need to fantasize and you will work it

324
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,679
out

325
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:02,760
it was just an introduction on how to

326
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:04,770
get the access before we get security

327
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,960
assessment and then the security

328
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:12,510
assessment so the first thing you need

329
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:18,510
to check out is how protected the Linux

330
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:29,870
or its variations is protected so we

331
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:29,870
have taken bullets and it would easily

332
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:36,350
work there

333
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:41,610
vulnera suits scanner what we like there

334
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:43,800
there was an open SSL it was an old one

335
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:47,189
so that was involved in vulnerable

336
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:52,500
involved in vulnerable to high bleed so

337
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:58,290
we decided just drop it so that all the

338
00:20:52,500 --> 00:21:01,880
new vulnerabilities appeared and you see

339
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:07,590
that the patches look pretty sad as of

340
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:09,480
2015-2016 the worst situation and

341
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:12,510
actually I remember even in scattered

342
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:16,560
was much better I remember having a

343
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:19,290
favorite slide with the wincc with the

344
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:23,909
February 27 7 but I was showing this

345
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:31,530
slide in 2013 and I remember having the

346
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:35,910
guys in 2005 2007 so I remember Sivan's

347
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:39,810
having this version vulnerable to high

348
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:41,760
bleed so it's all pretty complicated so

349
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:46,590
the basic settings of the operating

350
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:50,450
systems basic security checklist for any

351
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:54,060
Linux in 99% of the cases it doesn't run

352
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:55,730
and all the problem functions are things

353
00:21:54,060 --> 00:22:00,129
are related to

354
00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:02,470
root privileges these files are

355
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:04,700
omnipresent and sometimes the

356
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:09,040
manufacturers don't know about situate

357
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:11,780
files because sometimes we see that

358
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:14,720
there was a case when they would just

359
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:18,410
pull up the drivers of the hardware

360
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:22,490
platforms and then there would be a tiny

361
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:25,990
file which would manage the led consult

362
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:29,780
it could be a situated file and would be

363
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:31,730
calling commands under the root like it

364
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:34,580
was written by the manufacturer of five

365
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:36,730
years ago and they were just simply

366
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:39,320
reluctant about it but anyway just

367
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:41,900
install it into a platform just to make

368
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:45,139
sure that in that particular hardware it

369
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:49,700
works and you get related

370
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:54,890
vulnerabilities so and we were quite

371
00:22:49,700 --> 00:23:00,650
surprised in 2018 there were some web

372
00:22:54,890 --> 00:23:04,760
interfaces which would operate on the

373
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:09,440
root these two final slides show that

374
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:14,150
this is a direct challenge to the

375
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:17,960
management so any vulnerability in that

376
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:21,830
script it means that you get to root

377
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:26,960
access so I will just smoothly move to

378
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:30,470
web interfaces I'm an old person so when

379
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:33,710
people started writing on JavaScript on

380
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:36,020
the server it became kind of hurtful for

381
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:39,920
me to get surprised about the

382
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:42,889
degradation of development so the

383
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:45,380
developers would normally confuse the

384
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:50,510
client and server and I would later show

385
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:52,790
you some funny examples normally there

386
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:55,540
is a client-side vulnerability and there

387
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:55,540
are plenty of them

388
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:07,310
most of the vulnerabilities are in the

389
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:12,920
management interfaces and the vectors of

390
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:15,500
the attacks are well known and the

391
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:18,080
reaction of one of the manufacturers was

392
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:20,630
quite interesting so when we said that

393
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:25,820
you have quite a lot of similar bugs and

394
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:33,200
they say why would we remove them

395
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:37,490
Google's Rome blocks them there was a an

396
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:41,000
interesting situation really and I

397
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:44,270
remember that it was a no GS consequence

398
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,180
when the developer confused the client

399
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:52,970
part and the server part they took a

400
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:55,760
part of that inserted it into the client

401
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:59,650
part somehow it didn't work so what did

402
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:05,210
he do they would comment the code and

403
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:08,210
added if username equals so forth so

404
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:11,120
that's the client javascript in the

405
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:13,520
browser but initially there was a server

406
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:18,189
based one and it kind of got confused

407
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:22,370
there was another yet interesting vector

408
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:24,950
for the post usage so we have virtual

409
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:27,050
machines as the one is not just one

410
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:30,020
computer there are plenty of machines

411
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:35,120
but those of you have worked with that

412
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:39,160
you know that traditionally if you just

413
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:41,840
bend the service on the localhost

414
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:46,310
localhost sometimes it doesn't work

415
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:49,250
because local host is global for all

416
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:51,139
these virtual machines so for example if

417
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:54,140
you have a local proxy if you have

418
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:58,360
received this access access you can get

419
00:25:54,140 --> 00:26:01,390
access to this virtual machines remotely

420
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:04,669
so the authentication can be completed

421
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:08,660
afterwards so such solutions do work and

422
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:12,170
a local host there may be multiple

423
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:17,570
system-related tools like monitoring

424
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:22,550
systems shelling the box so forth where

425
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:27,879
you would just later use the useful

426
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:27,879
remote control management play by proxy

427
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:33,380
[Music]

428
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:35,360
very interesting thing and so will you

429
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:38,600
please excuse me for this simple design

430
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:41,270
of this slide as AI da here just like

431
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:45,379
those virtual functions can be used by

432
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:47,120
bad guys the first attack vector so

433
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:49,700
through a vulnerability through the

434
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,020
processing traffic in the manager

435
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,820
application you get into the

436
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:55,340
virtualization function and after that

437
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:57,560
will virtually get to the local host and

438
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:59,929
you can either go further to the

439
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:01,820
operation system level or go to other

440
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:03,770
functions of virtualization and get

441
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,950
those additional privileges there

442
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:10,700
because virtually you are you have

443
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:13,850
already switched to them across the

444
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:17,210
border of the security yeah security

445
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:19,750
boundary and no one will think how you

446
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:22,550
will be protected one if once one of the

447
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:25,670
virtualization function is broken broken

448
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:28,610
and you get access inside so Burma from

449
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:30,590
the outside and the web vulnerabilities

450
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:32,780
there are millions of them and that

451
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:34,760
Dennis will tell you in more detail

452
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:36,740
about some things at a certain moment we

453
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,320
got tired and we got the application

454
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:41,840
inspector from the positive and went

455
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:45,409
through the source codes and so there

456
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:47,540
are others in Java and the others and we

457
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:51,470
looked at them and found a big pack of

458
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:54,020
bugs at work of bugs and the one was

459
00:27:51,470 --> 00:28:01,460
quite interesting and it turned out to

460
00:27:54,020 --> 00:28:04,279
be a new option I'm a

461
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:06,679
I'm a mischeif you but that we have the

462
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:08,450
module and metal spoil of vulnerability

463
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:12,500
and that does not work in Metasploit but

464
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:15,110
this module as far as I remember was how

465
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:19,130
holding this get quake query and the if

466
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:22,279
you send us a post finally you you get

467
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:27,039
it through CJ's session and you just

468
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:31,100
perform the operation system command and

469
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:36,799
it is just for the picture because all

470
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:40,219
the vulnerability the other cell that

471
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:46,158
those links are weed to the dark side of

472
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:48,500
the forces and if you request for the

473
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:51,140
shadows are final shadows they will give

474
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:56,330
it to you he was ready today in the in

475
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:59,169
Citrix if I'm not mistaken so I'm I will

476
00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:02,120
not be speaking about cryptography

477
00:28:59,169 --> 00:29:06,399
Dennis will be talking about it at

478
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:11,320
length and though you can just study

479
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:15,770
wrong design of the cryptography at the

480
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:18,408
applied level and you can also face 4141

481
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:21,740
you know that's all yeah you can tell

482
00:29:18,409 --> 00:29:24,679
and you know this additional one of

483
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:26,840
those binary search as G van takes from

484
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:34,520
other producers because they all right

485
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:37,610
usually at the high level languages and

486
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:40,580
why all this story is called as to new

487
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:47,689
hope and the association with the Star

488
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:52,330
Wars because one of the producers Marvel

489
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:56,029
sucks so we decided that that's true we

490
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:58,879
like conventional science fiction better

491
00:29:56,029 --> 00:30:00,919
than comics and the route these are

492
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:05,050
cases of vulnerability from different

493
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:10,770
producers different vendors hard codes

494
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:13,629
the problems with access and

495
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:18,040
vulnerabilities in linux and things like

496
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:19,690
that and this is just a comparative the

497
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,790
table but all most of the

498
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:24,160
vulnerabilities are in public's of the

499
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:26,680
vendors would remove and fix them and we

500
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:29,410
are writing about it and so at our

501
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:32,440
project that you can go and see the

502
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:42,900
vendor that you wonder what he has

503
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:46,480
removed and what has not yet one of the

504
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:49,300
requirement to as Deven project as we

505
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,070
have as functionality of zero touch

506
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:53,139
deployment of zero dash provision

507
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:59,649
usually all vendors have it the idea is

508
00:30:53,140 --> 00:31:01,510
as soon as you get a box and just turn

509
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:04,420
it on and immediately it will start

510
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:06,430
working and route the traffic and

511
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:09,430
perform some security functions and so

512
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:12,010
on and the various producers various

513
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:16,710
vendors differently approaches this

514
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:22,650
critical function and the revenger who

515
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:22,650
realize it and add some mechanism

516
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:35,990
though actually they some some vendors

517
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:38,639
don't do it as oh they carry out a real

518
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:44,130
sometimes they find vulnerabilities in

519
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:48,060
in it but for instance as an example of

520
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:51,480
unsafe design unsecure design so we take

521
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:54,030
arista it has open source realization of

522
00:31:51,480 --> 00:32:00,960
a zero time provisioning of services and

523
00:31:54,030 --> 00:32:05,399
the main idea is that RT HTTP should not

524
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:08,550
be used at all in order to connect this

525
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:14,670
device to authenticate you need to use

526
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:18,450
HTTP as a rule some secrets or one-time

527
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:20,220
tokens would be used and associated this

528
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:22,740
device to some configuration in the

529
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:25,140
cloud or at the orchestrator side and

530
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,670
controller in the network and the

531
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,770
applications and use of this

532
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:33,660
configuration if we don't use a

533
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:36,360
protected secure channel then first we

534
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:40,260
can either connect this device to an

535
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:45,419
arbitrary network or hacker perpetrators

536
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:51,510
network or we can use malicious device

537
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:55,110
to this to this network and carry out an

538
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:57,120
attack and another element interesting

539
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:59,669
element that has to do with the fact

540
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:02,909
that as it is a virtual appliance it

541
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:05,070
would be reasonable to distribute

542
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:09,660
through clouds you can go to for

543
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:13,290
instance WS marketplace or sure Warren

544
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:16,260
just simply take and download as this

545
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:20,120
appliance play with it will start using

546
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:24,500
it and what a shocked us when we started

547
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:24,500
handling it that most of the vendors

548
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:33,270
have it as a standard virtual machine in

549
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:36,500
the cloud that you push and deploy all

550
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:39,600
the versions old releases with known

551
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:41,330
vulnerabilities on one hand it reminds

552
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:44,730
me

553
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:48,149
early 2000 early century when you just

554
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:52,789
whiffed fresh windows and immediately it

555
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:55,799
will either get cold red or because

556
00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:58,620
Internet Information Services service is

557
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:01,408
owned by default and whatever it gets

558
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:04,350
you need to install a patch and it's

559
00:34:01,409 --> 00:34:06,299
difficult to disconnect with deployment

560
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:08,509
so you have to raise it when it's off

561
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:10,830
and then install a patch and then

562
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:12,570
connect to the network but it's more

563
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:14,848
difficult because it's already in the

564
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:16,700
ground and by default you have some kind

565
00:34:14,849 --> 00:34:20,820
of management interface we certainly

566
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:24,000
told the vendors and they did some

567
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:26,460
exercises they performed some jobs but

568
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:31,139
but at a certain moment of time let's

569
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:34,379
say statistics for the upgrade and

570
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:39,500
renewal of those as the event solutions

571
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:44,989
that we saw in the web in the vws and

572
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:47,489
silver peak Citrix and versa virtually

573
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:52,529
available in the Internet and they are

574
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:54,089
not patched and it breaks as a trust out

575
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:57,270
the event concept everything is

576
00:34:54,089 --> 00:35:00,000
centralized as Rose a cloud you don't

577
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:02,700
have through goal to go through

578
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,609
operational things and think a lot it it

579
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:08,879
will magically come from the cloud no it

580
00:35:05,609 --> 00:35:12,720
doesn't happen and that's a pity you

581
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,930
expect it to be to be happening from the

582
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:20,990
cloud the force doesn't look that way

583
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:24,629
and another important thing you know in

584
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:27,270
in searching for the security is fixing

585
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:29,250
the bug fixing the vulnerabilities if

586
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:31,470
you don't treat this vulnerability you

587
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:34,200
have to write to the vendor the vendor

588
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:36,839
has to fix something then you have to

589
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:39,029
confirm and then it will publish the

590
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:41,790
release and everyone is happy you have

591
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:45,119
saved the world and many SD when

592
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:47,490
producers are supported for instance a

593
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:50,010
silver pit company said that they have

594
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:51,529
silver product security incident

595
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:53,990
response team

596
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:56,690
they wrote an article that's important

597
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:58,399
that they have this Center the company

598
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:00,740
when they found the vulnerability we

599
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:04,760
certainly decided to bring it back to

600
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:08,419
them to this Center but after half an

601
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:10,820
hour of googling we did not find even we

602
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:13,610
fail to find the email address just a

603
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:16,430
mentioning in an article data photo with

604
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:21,470
the PR person with the PR purposes at

605
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:26,060
this Center is there as good the we did

606
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:27,680
we found the previous message and they

607
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:30,590
said the previous two minutes and there

608
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:33,020
is a working option to write a letter to

609
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:38,420
the general director to the president I

610
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:42,490
could not find a message about better

611
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:45,440
than in in a link I found him and he

612
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:50,209
replied and we started working so in any

613
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:52,780
unclear situation write a letter to the

614
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:57,380
president if we want to fix a

615
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:58,940
vulnerability and this is a cumulative

616
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:03,170
table there were many interesting

617
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:07,640
stories to conventional stories and I

618
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:12,470
says the Cisco and Citrix and fill a

619
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:15,410
cloud in VMware well if I remember they

620
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:19,000
have a quite processes it was the clear

621
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:21,680
script and vulnerabilities are so quite

622
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,800
quite quite the thing that we are used

623
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:27,169
to you can get as a product teams the

624
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,930
security team and then you decide what

625
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:32,390
to tow together so certainly someone is

626
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:35,390
faster someone is sober to fix it but

627
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:38,359
some guys certainly have zero level of

628
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:41,629
interaction it's either silent patches

629
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:45,890
or no reply or no can't contact the

630
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:48,160
detail or whatever or no thank you from

631
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:48,160
them

632
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:59,890
so the question is a well a researcher

633
00:37:54,610 --> 00:38:01,660
friendly well after the getting in touch

634
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:03,400
with CEO we shall provide the

635
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,870
information and the product will ask why

636
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,720
are you doing it

637
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:09,640
why are writing from Gmail and where is

638
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:12,939
your official ID please attach your

639
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:16,629
passport or whatever let me let me let

640
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:17,470
me report about the vulnerability call

641
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:20,290
Nakano

642
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:24,490
yeah we all went through that in 2018

643
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:26,740
well in 2019 actually the situation

644
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:31,299
keeps changing another interesting

645
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:37,479
project a set of projects would you like

646
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:43,120
to tell about them in order to get the

647
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:47,140
statistics on the cloud on the number of

648
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:52,299
devices in the web some how to write

649
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:54,509
your own small vulnerability scanner we

650
00:38:52,300 --> 00:39:00,700
deserve we developed a number of tools

651
00:38:54,510 --> 00:39:06,840
that act as front-end to a mob to senses

652
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:10,689
to to others and so on and in order to

653
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:13,060
to to the out of the box that they

654
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:14,940
routine job for the research is some

655
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:20,020
pictures some districts more convenient

656
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:23,500
so this is for May 2019 the internet

657
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:25,840
conditions different solutions and the

658
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:31,180
products that we know and we have in our

659
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:35,260
database and we have three instruments

660
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:39,520
and one of them is framework and we

661
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:42,910
developed a framework on how to make

662
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:46,450
those analytic reports that use all

663
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:50,430
tools from the web and today at the fast

664
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:53,960
track we shall have a report about it

665
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:58,509
and listen how it works

666
00:39:53,960 --> 00:40:02,839
and how you can use it in your research

667
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:08,869
it's not just about SD when it's about

668
00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:13,190
all Skoda's IOT and arbitrary well

669
00:40:08,869 --> 00:40:15,619
simple logic there are so many search

670
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:18,520
machine salya shot the census under what

671
00:40:15,619 --> 00:40:21,559
they have different options different

672
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:23,630
fingerprint depth and the soldier is a

673
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:27,619
conveyor that collects all the

674
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:31,819
information and then if you wish you can

675
00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:36,200
also use an mapping the number of

676
00:40:31,819 --> 00:40:39,890
scripts for SD one especially as even

677
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:45,439
harvester you can use it without any

678
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:47,180
sensors in the internal pin test because

679
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:52,059
you have those fingerprints and things

680
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:52,058
so not just that everything on get so

681
00:40:52,690 --> 00:41:00,109
you get it when we tested those systems

682
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:04,990
we heard this interesting piece of news

683
00:41:00,109 --> 00:41:09,140
that in the darknet they publish SSH of

684
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:13,009
hacked machines and we went to see

685
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:16,509
what's that and it's both conventional

686
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:20,839
hardware and the silver peak in the list

687
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:24,049
also and then IP address actually

688
00:41:20,839 --> 00:41:26,750
matched one of our IP address that we go

689
00:41:24,049 --> 00:41:29,569
through Schroder and then we saw that

690
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:35,960
it's a match of a very low probability

691
00:41:29,569 --> 00:41:39,109
and there is a rule so very trivial some

692
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:41,240
sales and systems have default passwords

693
00:41:39,109 --> 00:41:42,680
and as we can see those default

694
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:45,439
passwords are forever

695
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:49,308
if you don't force the users to change

696
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:51,109
them once in a while and then we looked

697
00:41:49,309 --> 00:41:55,069
and we saw that there are many hard

698
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:59,540
codes for instance in that very silver

699
00:41:55,069 --> 00:42:02,250
pick and when we advise the vendor said

700
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:04,710
it's not good as an P public

701
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:07,770
and he said I have disconnected us an

702
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:09,780
appeal by default if the user switches

703
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:13,530
on he would look so we went again to

704
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:14,990
that shot shot and then we saw many on

705
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:18,859
the web so bad

706
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:22,919
good good hard core passwords is bad

707
00:42:18,859 --> 00:42:26,009
because they still are there so ideally

708
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:30,770
you should not have them and we don't

709
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:34,800
have much time so I shall go through it

710
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:37,470
through those interesting deficiencies

711
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,650
of design and development that we found

712
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:44,069
and many Sdn product so the first those

713
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:46,890
hardcore passwords why are they a hard

714
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:50,730
core why that means traitor right such

715
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:58,980
script because it is impossible to

716
00:42:50,730 --> 00:43:01,140
change them and many so and so and

717
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:06,020
especially when the services are built

718
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:09,348
according to the reference model and and

719
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:13,980
several vendors have that such situation

720
00:43:09,349 --> 00:43:20,310
for example the hard core hard-coded

721
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:26,820
password we see this is for REST API for

722
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:30,480
the server analytics and a still this

723
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:36,119
check is included in our tools just like

724
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:38,510
the simplest checks of that kind and

725
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:41,430
then the next level hard-coded

726
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:44,130
cryptographic keys at the all citric

727
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:48,210
devices they use the same close and open

728
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:51,300
key and the relevant certificate and if

729
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:54,690
you deployed as a device and VBS and

730
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:57,000
caught though that key and you could

731
00:43:54,690 --> 00:44:01,220
listen to the traffic between the

732
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:04,200
orchestrator and controller and you can

733
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:06,598
actually bring the configuration to the

734
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:09,348
to config you can configure and they use

735
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:12,900
the protocols that protected at all and

736
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:15,520
this is the chart of absolutely all the

737
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:18,340
devices of SD when

738
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:21,730
within asd when product get the

739
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:24,130
appliance keys and the so called yeah

740
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:27,370
that's the name of the file with the two

741
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:32,020
keys behind it as the one Center is an

742
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:33,910
Orchestrator and in order to to be able

743
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:36,580
to interact with the controller

744
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:39,009
adminstrator need to generate manually

745
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:41,860
this certificate on SD one Center and

746
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:44,200
loaded upload to all controllers so it

747
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:47,010
would be authenticated through the

748
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:50,980
certificate and the SDN controller

749
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:54,340
authenticate before the SD when center

750
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:58,240
using white list which has this

751
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:59,950
certificate and it's not just the

752
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:03,250
fingerprint of the certificate but

753
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:06,970
specific certificate and we have

754
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:09,850
discovered it in such a way which we

755
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:11,950
just took and installed our own

756
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:13,839
certificate at all devices as nothing

757
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:15,879
has changed so no matter what

758
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:18,430
certificate it can be any certificate

759
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:20,590
generated by you doesn't matter it's

760
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:24,490
important to have one and the same

761
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:28,000
certificate so as you use TLS RSA and

762
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:31,120
for a secret cement of Windows a hidden

763
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:35,610
key we get all the traffic from the past

764
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:38,620
as well and we're getting is a chance to

765
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:41,020
work in the Internet in the cloud and

766
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:44,109
then we see the protocol that was

767
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:46,720
protected by this JLS the gate command

768
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:49,860
as a so token and to get the

769
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:53,669
configuration to load it whatever and

770
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:58,210
what's interesting within this protocol

771
00:45:53,670 --> 00:46:01,300
at the applied level the PSK protection

772
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:03,430
main security mechanism was provided so

773
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:05,890
you have the username and password that

774
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:07,930
you have the similar options at the

775
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:11,500
server and the server has been launched

776
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:14,350
without lagina password in your eyes

777
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:16,780
there are no tools to set up this login

778
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:18,490
and password in the protocol as a

779
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:20,620
research yes but it will be launched

780
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:23,049
without login and password and there is

781
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:26,009
no way you can

782
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:29,500
set it up so for instance this is a case

783
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:31,690
you have the name on top and then crypto

784
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:37,150
spell whatever our configuration that's

785
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:40,090
what you have then brain for net a

786
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:44,830
Russian vendor and though we have tested

787
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:47,380
it at a pin test and so we analyzed and

788
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:49,330
saw some classic vulnerabilities some

789
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:52,090
conventional vulnerabilities and run

790
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:54,130
from the point of view of including in

791
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:56,350
key management there's nothing to

792
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:59,230
analyze because everything is open and

793
00:46:56,350 --> 00:47:02,740
yesterday I was talking and showing this

794
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:04,750
slide at Yandex OS Mitaka conference and

795
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:06,759
there were people from renfa net and

796
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:10,540
they said that we've got a deployment

797
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:12,880
without TLS without TLS there is a TLS

798
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:14,560
deployment but and everything is nice

799
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:17,340
and they know that it should be

800
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:21,220
protected by TLS like just like RFC

801
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:23,290
recommends so if you launch at this OS

802
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:25,359
shark at this deployment we'll get some

803
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:30,220
protocol like a jar PC high availability

804
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:33,010
everything is open and then versa has

805
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:35,379
similar situation there are many typical

806
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:38,770
well it's a typical test routine test we

807
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:41,470
just take and we launch where shark and

808
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:43,540
see what's on the ports and most

809
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:45,759
probably we shall get the service the

810
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:50,520
most interesting situation a very

811
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:55,900
interesting case a silver pick they have

812
00:47:50,520 --> 00:48:00,450
IP circa on Aug P and as we have Sdn and

813
00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:03,790
between routers and and the there is

814
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:08,680
IPSec and there is a speech as we have

815
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:12,160
Sdn and t1 we certainly don't want the

816
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:18,009
protocol of keys coordination to be told

817
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:21,399
because it's Sdn and and what do we do

818
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:24,340
now it's only some protocols are only in

819
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:28,680
development now which are trapped in RFC

820
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:29,880
that they try to build protocols

821
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,430
[Music]

822
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:38,690
of key management through a controller a

823
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:43,879
silver pick indeed each vendor has two

824
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:46,500
to do such solutions on their own and

825
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:48,090
with the documentation with the way it

826
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:51,930
works so you can look at the silver

827
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:55,260
thing in a pin test we look at the hub

828
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:57,930
we defined the silver people yeah look

829
00:48:55,260 --> 00:49:00,600
at that script and see why this group

830
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:04,259
and UI doesn't have login and password

831
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:08,009
and also look at the code and there is a

832
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:11,400
monitor and hardcore and they keep

833
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:13,620
working and we have a database you can

834
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:15,300
connect and see that they work indeed

835
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:19,520
and there is another interesting and

836
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:22,730
pointer if you go there you see all the

837
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:28,110
configuration cryptography calls appears

838
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:30,540
pre-shared keys IPSec data and here we

839
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:33,660
see how you can run through this base

840
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:37,290
and watch was there and she was there

841
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:39,870
and in November 2018 approximately 150

842
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:42,200
devices monitor monitor they supported

843
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:46,830
and there should we look at this

844
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:49,290
structure in the interesting things

845
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:53,880
highlighted in red and we have perfect

846
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:56,070
for secrecy secrecy and Samaria keys

847
00:49:53,880 --> 00:50:02,510
water was the idea there is an

848
00:49:56,070 --> 00:50:02,510
Orchestrator that sense to all devices

849
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:13,860
one and the same key one of the same key

850
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:16,950
key material and then something happens

851
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:19,710
to it and the slide says is

852
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:21,540
unfortunately module 2 and some it's

853
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:24,990
it's a bad solution if it is the case

854
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:27,029
and once we are from the official

855
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:28,649
document and from the earlier document

856
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:32,160
that you can see on the web

857
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:35,280
so as it Orchestrator well sent to all

858
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:37,319
the devices seed 1 then the same CD will

859
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,400
change at a certain moment of time and

860
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:41,220
then

861
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:49,040
some kind of nuns will be used used only

862
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:52,049
once and from there you get single

863
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:54,420
directional key if we go to those nuns

864
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:58,890
you see us no not exactly nuns they

865
00:50:54,420 --> 00:51:01,680
repeat themselves as the documentation

866
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:03,750
and design is not there so judging by

867
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:05,790
the same semantics station by the world

868
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:08,609
you can guess if it is not send it and

869
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:14,690
it repeats it's a bad design from the

870
00:51:08,609 --> 00:51:17,970
security point of view in such a way

871
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:22,580
there are no perfect for secrecy forward

872
00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:28,859
secrecy is not there and key exchange

873
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:30,450
2011 24 hours does not match the modern

874
00:51:28,859 --> 00:51:30,840
standards because it should be two

875
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:33,750
minutes

876
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:36,710
there is no AG primitive that should be

877
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:42,510
used in nowadays in the cryptographic

878
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:45,089
protocols and so on in fact we are

879
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:46,950
looking for vulnerabilities did the

880
00:51:45,089 --> 00:51:49,200
people look for them people publish them

881
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:50,910
so when you see the list some something

882
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,279
will be probably published a move later

883
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:56,460
sooner or later and we have a couple of

884
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:59,369
articles at our archive or one about the

885
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:02,040
front escape we tried to group those

886
00:51:59,369 --> 00:52:05,490
around their abilities and provide

887
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:06,839
understanding where you should click to

888
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:11,160
for the pentesters and for the

889
00:52:06,839 --> 00:52:15,299
developers the way you shouldn't do so

890
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:17,790
and then we want to publish so the

891
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:21,119
specific cases that we considered with

892
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:23,609
the brightest and most telling examples

893
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:28,710
everything in open access and as a

894
00:52:23,609 --> 00:52:30,060
conclusion there are lots of hype but we

895
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:33,150
have a feeling that most of the

896
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:35,099
developers just goes a you know easy way

897
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:39,900
they take something from the public

898
00:52:35,099 --> 00:52:43,950
compile and then call it our own sd1 but

899
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:46,920
in fact the approach is one practical

900
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:49,529
many components in open source I get to

901
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,369
the necessary level but if you actually

902
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:53,769
team someone you you

903
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:55,630
responsible for that you need to get

904
00:52:53,769 --> 00:52:59,470
worried

905
00:52:55,630 --> 00:53:02,710
and you need to think about security at

906
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:04,749
this a critical thing so when these

907
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:07,630
network infrastructure what Dennis was

908
00:53:04,749 --> 00:53:09,730
telling you this is all they interface a

909
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:11,890
control interface this is the the

910
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:17,619
intestines of the systems not even the

911
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:21,339
user traffic and again the volume of

912
00:53:17,619 --> 00:53:24,549
open source use is a quite astonishing

913
00:53:21,339 --> 00:53:27,009
it's not bad but some somewhere guys for

914
00:53:24,549 --> 00:53:30,730
Sri kuttan formal security

915
00:53:27,009 --> 00:53:33,069
you know what security the they use

916
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:38,019
rules of 2014 when they installed we

917
00:53:33,069 --> 00:53:40,599
have this one this signature and those

918
00:53:38,019 --> 00:53:42,939
brackets does not change but it keeps

919
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:45,730
developing and the application security

920
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:47,109
can be upgraded with the signature so

921
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:54,789
it's there yeah

922
00:53:47,109 --> 00:54:01,420
in surah cut yep in the in dpi it was an

923
00:53:54,789 --> 00:54:03,700
old DDoS in the stock rules so if it is

924
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:05,529
not written properly if you it will eat

925
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:07,868
your up your processor it will use up

926
00:54:05,529 --> 00:54:09,609
that same known vulnerability but you

927
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:16,089
needed to clean it properly they didn't

928
00:54:09,609 --> 00:54:18,249
do it and similar products patch

929
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:20,950
management problems huge number of

930
00:54:18,249 --> 00:54:26,078
management interfaces very difficult to

931
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:30,009
understand what they do we give default

932
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:33,339
settings and before you decide to use

933
00:54:30,009 --> 00:54:35,880
Sdn solutions first you know disassemble

934
00:54:33,339 --> 00:54:39,730
it look in and see how vendor will

935
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:41,230
handle your you know handling you know

936
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:42,759
if you fiddle with it and break it

937
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:44,650
otherwise you all your network

938
00:54:42,759 --> 00:54:46,700
infrastructure will be like a scene

939
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:53,720
thank you thank you

940
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:58,160
we are done do we have time for

941
00:54:53,720 --> 00:55:02,410
questions questions do we have questions

942
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:02,410
colleagues thank you

943
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:07,910
so two best questions earn a t-shirt two

944
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:16,400
questions

945
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:22,490
earn a t-shirt I'm listening a question

946
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:27,140
mark question interpreter cannot hear

947
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:31,250
because microphone is not used for

948
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:36,799
translation microphone should be used

949
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:42,010
most security yes anything else no if

950
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:42,010
you had rough then you had mold security

951
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:59,430
sd1 system well if you need a white box

952
00:55:53,760 --> 00:56:02,390
I think for $15,000 you can you can

953
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:04,710
easily get it it's not a deployment of

954
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:09,750
specific system but it's a matter of

955
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:12,690
depth if you need to analyze binaries or

956
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:15,150
whatever if you just need the cross

957
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:19,260
section on main holes it's not expensive

958
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:23,220
you saw you saw I was showing you if it

959
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:26,160
is I call it the intestine to the first

960
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:30,560
buck you take cwe and start clicking to

961
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:30,560
the first bug yes go ahead

962
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:53,140
yes primary analysis we concentrated on

963
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:55,960
Versailles we focus on versus citrix

964
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:58,060
coordinate silver pick as I told you we

965
00:56:55,960 --> 00:57:01,750
have them on the list we found some

966
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:04,090
small bugs but we like the way they work

967
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:07,540
it's not a matter that the half bugs no

968
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:09,790
have bugs bugs are everywhere but the

969
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:13,450
most important is how vendor takes it

970
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:15,850
and what we saw in VMware we liked just

971
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:18,609
like Cisco they are mature in this

972
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:21,870
respect in working and removing and

973
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:25,870
fixing those bugs how they rethink

974
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:28,390
because if you just you know catch those

975
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:30,580
bugs one by one probably they looked and

976
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:32,109
said probably we have many and some

977
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:34,509
things they reported they closed

978
00:57:32,110 --> 00:57:41,290
themselves so win like the way they

979
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:46,230
operated thank you thank you have a good

980
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:46,230
day approaches for the t-shirts
