1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,430
so demon-like see Jax of Superman the

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,330
medium enters the water world in the

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:12,360
modern infrastructure yes quite a lot

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:15,210
changes is changing our approach is

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:19,830
changing expert approach to the search

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:23,939
of other villages is changing how to get

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:26,549
prepared for new challenges at least you

8
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:34,460
need to ask this question so I'm passing

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:37,050
the floor to Dimitri our speaker good

10
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:39,510
afternoon dear colleagues of the Metro

11
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,328
Binet aberration MIT security experts at

12
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,460
crop I'm happy to welcome you at this

13
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:48,890
event I'll tell you about the role of

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:51,500
machine learning in looking for

15
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:54,149
attackers and the world is changing

16
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:59,070
everything is changing the cities the

17
00:00:54,149 --> 00:01:02,850
country's new technologies appears cars

18
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:05,299
replaced the steam is a Tesla car is

19
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:08,250
basically server in wheels that allows

20
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:12,619
controlling the car also fully

21
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:15,030
automatically of course you need serious

22
00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:19,350
computing resources to do that large

23
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:21,689
companies include more and more of a

24
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,580
server infrastructure one of our

25
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:27,330
customers has more than 10 thousand

26
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:30,479
servers consuming about 8 megawatts of

27
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,939
energy this affects business processes

28
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,759
what happens with the information

29
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:38,548
security the edge of the networks

30
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,680
becomes blood users work with different

31
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:45,270
devices mobile devices web interfaces

32
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:49,020
cloud resources as as model is getting

33
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:52,310
more and more popular so you have to go

34
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,240
beyond the standard multi-layer

35
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:57,920
protection

36
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,390
approaches but also utilize how the user

37
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,040
interacts with all information or source

38
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:06,119
of the company or what application with

39
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,459
any data to use in order to process this

40
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,919
size of information is clear that the

41
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,590
number of servers may go beyond a

42
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:18,149
thousand and large companies fault

43
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:21,030
tolerant solution with the backup site a

44
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:25,200
toe leads in a situation of where

45
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:27,180
millions of events have to be analyzed

46
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,010
using proactive security system as

47
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,470
opposed to a standard security system

48
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:35,480
that was following a pre-configured

49
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:39,810
profiles and patterns and require

50
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:42,420
regular updating of attribute-based

51
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:46,739
new systems are based on machine

52
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:48,839
learning this allows any system to fully

53
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:52,140
adapt that any changes in the item to

54
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,870
structure in the human resources and

55
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:58,339
processes of course developing as such

56
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:02,780
models requires new competences these

57
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:06,620
the companies of data analysts

58
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:09,150
scientists people who know which a task

59
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:12,780
which algorithm can be used to so task a

60
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,829
data engineer who knows who no

61
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,470
requirements to the physical

62
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:19,440
infrastructure may be it would be enough

63
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:21,720
five devices or ten devices in the

64
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,450
cluster maybe your needs Edition and in

65
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,970
every database to have prompt access

66
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:29,339
surfaces to the user profile comparing a

67
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:31,620
physical activities improving the

68
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,350
response times and of course a lot of

69
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,000
other things if you consider this in

70
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:38,549
practical terms and then the ones they

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,480
offer data scientist looks like this

72
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:45,630
first they get information that some

73
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:50,399
logs need to be analyzed to identify

74
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:52,350
some anomalous activity motifs or some

75
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,660
other tasks for instance so we get a

76
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:59,220
task of analyzing

77
00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:00,930
logs from the firewall to see what uses

78
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:04,260
what makes us different from

79
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:07,380
administrators and to use an algorithm

80
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:09,660
other the use of activity is related to

81
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:12,720
the work of administrator so this our

82
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:14,549
hypothesis and it needs to be confirmed

83
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,380
you know to confirm this hypothesis we

84
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:20,970
need to develop a lot of models and part

85
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:23,060
of them shed has not effective for a

86
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:26,160
specific infrastructure well as others

87
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:29,040
expanded added to you know to minimize

88
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,260
the number of false positives and to

89
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,090
maximize the potential outcome for the

90
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:35,070
organization of course after that you

91
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:38,280
need to customize the algorithm improve

92
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:41,070
the performance so that you they could

93
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:44,059
be used alive in enterprise solutions

94
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:47,340
right on live data so how does it look

95
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:49,380
as part of the data scientist workday

96
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:54,330
for instance they're getting a number of

97
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:58,110
columns at the input and the check point

98
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:59,969
the next stage of their work is to

99
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,070
determine whether this information is

100
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:05,100
enough to build a model as I said our

101
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:07,080
task is to build a model that allows us

102
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,930
to differentiate a regular user from

103
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,599
administrator because you don't have a

104
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:15,419
user name the most important entity that

105
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,510
allows matching an IP address or a set

106
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:20,280
of IP addresses if the user works from

107
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,870
different workstations with the

108
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,059
different activities then this

109
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,890
information is added to by indicating

110
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,830
the date and time for instance because

111
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:31,229
you don't know the workday of an

112
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,880
employee we clarify this information and

113
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,710
enrich the model so they should also

114
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,159
know that the workday of an employee is

115
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:39,989
from 9:00 to 5:00 and the rest will be a

116
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,640
potential deviation from the working

117
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,610
schedule of the next step would be to

118
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:47,460
convert all information into some 2d and

119
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,500
3d models the standard representation of

120
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,419
a machining learning not only is a

121
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:59,460
multi-dimensional space that includes

122
00:05:51,419 --> 00:06:04,570
hundreds of elements in our case for

123
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:06,400
firewall backlog analysis 77 attributes

124
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:08,080
turned out to be enough oh but enough to

125
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,599
visualize this information connect way

126
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:14,219
so it could be worked with we need to

127
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:16,570
use a special algorithm to reduce this

128
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,370
dimensionality as you can see over a

129
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:20,770
several points here related to the work

130
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:23,890
of an illustrator indeed it's possible

131
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:25,990
to separate the irregular user activity

132
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:29,530
from anomalous activity represented by

133
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:32,170
red and green points then you use

134
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:35,109
different algorithms that allow us to

135
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:37,450
reduce the dimensionality showed in 2d

136
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:40,030
mode to filter out a necessary component

137
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:42,729
in the previous slide we saw that there

138
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:44,679
was some service surface identified in

139
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:47,170
blue you know to get rid of the surface

140
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:51,210
we just ignore the first two components

141
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:54,700
which the report for us and just leave

142
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:57,219
75 instead of 77 components and then we

143
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:59,710
convert these 77 components into 2d

144
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:02,140
representation here we use quite

145
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,609
sophisticated mathematics because we

146
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:07,240
need to identify the most effective

147
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:09,330
criteria and threshold thresholds for

148
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,880
our analysis and this analysis can

149
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:14,500
includes not only administrators and

150
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,580
user but it can be applied to any task

151
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:19,600
that you have in terms of a data analyst

152
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:23,859
it looks like this

153
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:26,980
they analyze analyze the model using

154
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:29,230
purely formal attributes looking for

155
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:33,280
dependencies for instance here we see a

156
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:35,050
normal motion representation of users or

157
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,219
distribution of you but it can't be

158
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:42,190
shown as a classic ellipse in this case

159
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:45,550
the data analysts use a mostly solution

160
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:48,160
that allows to assess better which

161
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:50,919
algorithm or a set of algorithms must be

162
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,900
used to identify outliers

163
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:56,590
based on the results of the data

164
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:59,080
analysts work we arrived at the

165
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:02,020
possibility to create a specific model

166
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:04,890
that the models a sophisticated the

167
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:08,409
behavior of profiles it identifies a

168
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:10,870
number of blue points representing

169
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:14,680
normal user security so everything

170
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:16,900
beyond that is potentially abnormal

171
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,970
activities that require IT security

172
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:21,299
relate investigation so therefore we're

173
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:25,979
talk about a model of machine learning

174
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:29,169
the before the performance my so the

175
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:31,479
criteria can be formulated firstly by

176
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:34,718
being able to analyze large volumes of

177
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:37,870
data this slide showed you from a

178
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,120
processing of a million events this

179
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:42,929
information can't be processed to using

180
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:48,280
standard methods

181
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:50,920
so therefore a distributed system is a

182
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:55,240
huge error or Hortonworks

183
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:59,290
stack which allows implement different

184
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:01,750
behavior model models based on hadoop

185
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:04,349
and all these models are adapted to all

186
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:07,650
changes infrastructure we don't need to

187
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:12,610
reset the correlation rule every time

188
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:15,790
saying that five false names

189
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:18,550
failure attempts and is bad the next day

190
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:20,589
could be 10 the model takes a cancer

191
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,540
that automatically I statistics for the

192
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:28,150
past week and for the past month in

193
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:30,390
cases larger history is required to be

194
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:33,939
analyzed for instance to identify

195
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:37,750
abnormal activity related to the close

196
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:39,100
closing causes or a year and then we

197
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,540
arrive at patterns of abnormal

198
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,310
activities not only in the next work

199
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,079
architecture but also the level of

200
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,760
application systems that are of interest

201
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,500
to the customer of course there are some

202
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,420
drawbacks of course for instance the

203
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:53,620
system requires the data be quite clean

204
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:58,449
that requires additional analysis on the

205
00:09:53,620 --> 00:10:00,910
part of the data scientists to get some

206
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:03,100
additional logs involved and of course

207
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:05,199
it's also it also depends on the

208
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,880
competency of data scientists which by

209
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,870
the way according to the information

210
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,820
from Yandex

211
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:12,640
so within me I mean the de quoi demands

212
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:16,360
for such specialists has grown three

213
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:18,069
times has grown a threefold and in

214
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,450
conclusion I'd say that machine learning

215
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:22,150
is already used in quite a lot of

216
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:25,690
information security solutions it's

217
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:28,959
about getting protected from all sorts

218
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:30,850
of attacks attacks sand boxes analyzing

219
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,580
the code in some special conditions

220
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:36,040
including the changes in registry file

221
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,630
activity network activity this includes

222
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,510
a different system for instance hackers

223
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:42,700
also use machine learning as part of

224
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:44,560
fuzzing additional system that allow

225
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,750
analyzing and identifying

226
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,770
vulnerabilities and the classic approach

227
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:53,340
requires considerable time resources

228
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:56,650
machine learning and AI systems allow

229
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:58,840
reducing fuzzing computational

230
00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:01,270
requirements to explore levels and of

231
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:03,490
course it's about processing a large

232
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:08,020
volumes of data which we need to

233
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:17,170
proactively respond to threats such as

234
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:18,850
in cyber security cyber intelligence we

235
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:21,790
need to analyze a lot of data when it's

236
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:24,010
analyze data from closed and open

237
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:26,290
sources we need to analyze how hacker

238
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:29,410
groups work what Nick nicknames were

239
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:31,420
used in underground for us how these

240
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:36,910
nicknames are related to one another how

241
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:39,310
connection graphs designed so as to

242
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:41,350
understand which specific information

243
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,910
security abilities threats exist for

244
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,860
this particular customer all this

245
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:47,230
requires analyzing huge volumes of data

246
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:50,250
so therefore for cyber intelligence

247
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:53,080
machine learning and AI are fully

248
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:56,320
applicable well that's all I want to say

249
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:59,460
just a small advertisement as part of

250
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:02,830
our positive half days we are drawing

251
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:05,800
tickets to RSA conference in Singapore

252
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:09,070
you will take part you need to

253
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,560

257
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,640
waiting for you there

258
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:25,120
Thank You Dmitry questions to the

259
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:27,010
audience may be questions from the

260
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:32,410
audience maybe you have some doubts

261
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:35,620
regarding this technology so my question

262
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:37,990
is turns out that the quality model in

263
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,790
any way depends on the quality of data

264
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:43,050
that you fed to it am i right yes

265
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:45,520
exactly this indeed is a big problem and

266
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:48,099
because the source date can be

267
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:50,260
incomplete inaccurate they can contain

268
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:53,170
errors for instance when were analyzing

269
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:57,880
firewall dogs we identified that they

270
00:12:53,170 --> 00:13:01,060
use simple you user could connect from

271
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:05,410
the RDP domain and start session it was

272
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:08,170
a clear breaking of information security

273
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:10,390
but this data were part of the initial

274
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:11,469
selection so the model of machine

275
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,780
learning showed us that there were

276
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:17,800
certain anomalies then it was done out

277
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:21,939
to the data scientists identified was if

278
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:25,089
it was a false positive or bad low

279
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:33,450
quality data that needed cleansing thank

280
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:37,350
you questions yesterday in the biometric

281
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:40,620
biometry session they give an example I

282
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:48,730
think it was a picture of some dog and

283
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:51,070
the were 70.7% of some structure edits

284
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:58,080
and as result machine learning would

285
00:13:51,070 --> 00:14:00,760
issue a picture of a given so how to

286
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:05,530
identify such things because theythey

287
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:08,439
using specific example something may be

288
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:12,310
present that has got there by accident

289
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:15,740
how to understand that it's not a given

290
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:18,560
you're absolutely right perfect comment

291
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:21,200
yes indeed recently a lot of hacker

292
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:25,189
attack on physical infrastructure have

293
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:28,220
been made allowing them to cheat the

294
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:31,040
system a Tesla for instance I put

295
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:34,100
special labels on the lane there were

296
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:37,130
standard plastic squares but the machine

297
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:43,670
learning learning system perceived them

298
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:46,570
as a change in the street marking and

299
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:49,310
the Machine drove to the opposing lane

300
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:50,990
these are kind of had a hacker attack

301
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:53,270
the cookies you can put on a t-shirt

302
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:57,230
with a special QR code and personal with

303
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:59,949
this code will be will no longer be

304
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:04,340
perceived by information systems a human

305
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:06,290
there's an AI system forests built on

306
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:08,990
the premise that different machine

307
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:10,819
learning systems are compared so they

308
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:14,060
compete with each other and so the best

309
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:18,500
one is selected the better a model is

310
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:20,599
trained the better it is considered yes

311
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:25,610
so the drawbacks of the initial

312
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:27,980
selection is mostly related with the

313
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:32,140
size of data in it the more data we'll

314
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:32,140
have initially the better the quality

315
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,000
well I'm sorry but the question can't be

316
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:42,720
translated because the speaker is not

317
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,720
using the microphone

318
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:06,420
in our case for instance when analyzing

319
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:08,580
the file log what did we do to avoid

320
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:13,530
such situations firstly we had two

321
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:16,590
models model one was retrained it was

322
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:19,380
analyzing interactions of each user with

323
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:22,410
information system it was doing in a

324
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:28,830
retread mode and then this training mode

325
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:31,560
was no longer used in live operation but

326
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:34,980
the results of this analysis were used

327
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:39,079
for the operation of the second model if

328
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:43,380
we had information that the information

329
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:46,500
was recognized incorrectly by the first

330
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,030
model then the second model was trained

331
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:52,110
additionally so they had this feedback

332
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:55,290
loop my name is hello Demetri maybe I

333
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:57,890
missed out you shared a general concept

334
00:16:55,290 --> 00:17:01,020
but can you share a specific experience

335
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:04,290
of specific implementation of this

336
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:07,589
mechanism in life would you use as log

337
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:11,339
connect how did you store them how did

338
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:12,839
you distribute your confusing I'll tell

339
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:15,599
a bit about that because unfortunately

340
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:18,030
were limited in time what did we do as

341
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,948
part of this research firstly we need to

342
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:22,470
collect the information from the special

343
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:25,230
connected Swiss for that different same

344
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:27,750
systems in our case we were using

345
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:29,340
connector aux ITSM then we needed to

346
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,050
normalize it initially Alysha

347
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:34,770
nominalization was done in two stages

348
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:38,220
firstly you as part of C format that was

349
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:40,200
we get ultimately from cm system and the

350
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:43,530
second normalization was based on our

351
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:46,500
platform the platform it was based on

352
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:50,010
the Hadoop ecosystem and it includes

353
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:52,020
such component in fi that did this

354
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:54,270
additional normalization the filtering

355
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:56,190
out unnecessary data the next phase was

356
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:57,990
to transmit this information after

357
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:00,500
different models where data analysts

358
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:05,340
would see which models work better

359
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:06,510
we used Gaussian distribution or this is

360
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,820
a model that

361
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:14,010
the performance very well we also create

362
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:16,419
more complex models for Bach sphere we

363
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:19,600
we needed to create a recommendation

364
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:22,150
system to recommend to recommend the

365
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,939
credit for what some was the maximum and

366
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:27,580
so on - what client and so on this is

367
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:30,340
implemented with different decision

368
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:32,290
trees and additional machine learning

369
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:36,189
algorithms that we also use an our

370
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:38,280
proactive protection systems another

371
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:41,590
questions question if I may

372
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:44,230
you gave us a good example that I would

373
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:48,159
like to it become more to be more

374
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:50,290
concrete more new applications can be

375
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,440
embedded into what your analyzed it

376
00:18:50,290 --> 00:19:00,250
becomes senseless two years ago there

377
00:18:53,440 --> 00:19:02,950
was a spike in the Europe technology in

378
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:04,960
the interest for this technology and it

379
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:08,020
changed the so fast that the analysts

380
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:11,170
couldn't keep up so now what's the

381
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:13,660
what's your prediction yes indeed that

382
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:17,590
was one of the problem so why did we

383
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:20,800
begin to create our own model or just

384
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:24,040
behavioral analytics Eby solutions are

385
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:26,139
good the eb e is good it is trained it

386
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:28,690
is it suits the needs fits the needs of

387
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:30,309
the majority of clients and it is

388
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:33,130
assumed that after two or three months

389
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:36,490
you begin to use it to decision-making

390
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:40,120
in our case it's much faster if we

391
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:43,090
decide that an employee is user or a

392
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:45,669
business trader we can we can make this

393
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:48,340
decision based on the logs within week

394
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:51,450
and that's a very good example that's a

395
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,449
very good result

396
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:55,639
[Music]

397
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:09,029
that's right it's one thing when we

398
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:13,490
consider machine learning as a system

399
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:17,779
that it complicates the landscape of

400
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:21,570
threats but it's a completely different

401
00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:24,779
situation when we just use thresholds

402
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:27,779
the security administrator does not need

403
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:30,750
to think about unnecessary detail so we

404
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:33,620
have to know how to keep all the sub

405
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:36,090
supplementary I did was and accounts and

406
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:39,590
perhaps of the administrators have

407
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:43,470
certain perfect so that we can take and

408
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:47,009
decide decide whether or not an employee

409
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:49,049
is as privileged access so we can

410
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:51,440
determine the subscription but the more

411
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:54,658
we try to keep this information

412
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,860
up-to-date the more correlation rows we

413
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:58,500
have to write manually

414
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:02,039
machine learning allows us to create a

415
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:06,149
general rules the rules that fit the

416
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:07,980
majority of employees in which just set

417
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:11,758
the threshold that we need to analyze

418
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:14,100
that the figure of every single user or

419
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:17,149
do we need to analyze the groups of

420
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:22,230
users all we can raise this threshold

421
00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:27,658
and we just need to let's say separate

422
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:30,570
the users of our company from the users

423
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:34,259
of other organizations Thank You Dmitry

424
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:35,759
we have a lot of hmm presenters you

425
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:39,620
could take you you can go back to you

426
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:39,620
see thank you very much

427
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:49,450
what the last question from the audience

428
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:54,080
is a nice segue to the next presentation

429
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:58,009
the the boundaries of what's possible

430
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:05,178
for behavioral analysis of information

431
00:21:58,009 --> 00:22:13,149
flows he's going to tell us about mr.

432
00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:15,070
from CTO of web control I'm going to

433
00:22:13,149 --> 00:22:18,820
what the previous speaker has said

434
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:23,720
regarding the collection of a raw data

435
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:26,029
we didn't discuss this a lot so here's

436
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:30,559
what we're going to analyze but but what

437
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:33,559
do we analyze it is assumed that there's

438
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:35,769
a large geographically distributed

439
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:38,178
infrastructure and this infrastructure

440
00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:43,009
contains a lot of information resources

441
00:22:38,179 --> 00:22:44,960
a lot of activities and so on probably

442
00:22:43,009 --> 00:22:46,850
part of this infrastructure is somewhere

443
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:52,580
in the cloud part of it may be

444
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:57,709
virtualized and how do we collect from

445
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:59,658
it primary data or rotater

446
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:01,610
the technology that I'm going to discuss

447
00:22:59,659 --> 00:23:03,590
my presentation is exactly the

448
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:07,789
technology that's going to do that so

449
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:11,240
that does this I am going to mostly

450
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:13,309
focus on network infrastructure how do

451
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,650
you collect primary data from fresh

452
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:21,170
clothes

453
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:24,420
widespread standards NetFlow IP fix and

454
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:27,870
current versions of the standards allow

455
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:32,780
you to determine the set of metrics that

456
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:35,489
you select there is active network

457
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:40,500
equipment that generates network

458
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:41,940
telemetry so all the information flows

459
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,650
so that go through our information

460
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:46,380
structure goes through network equipment

461
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:48,660
and you network equipment can generate

462
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:51,150
this telemetry who went where we

463
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:56,190
download water of what data through what

464
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:58,260
ports and so on and what are we going to

465
00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:00,600
do with this data well first of all we

466
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:07,140
need to collect this telemetry and one

467
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:11,189
place in some place of important place

468
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:12,870
of our infrastructure there is no it

469
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:15,120
wouldn't disappoint the expert of

470
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:17,969
network infrastructure you can place a

471
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:21,330
special probe in this place that can

472
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:26,780
that can generate this geometry from raw

473
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:32,270
network the next task is to ensure

474
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:39,270
real-time access or fast access to this

475
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:42,300
vastness data provide search capability

476
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:44,220
since one and on top of it use it for

477
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:46,230
what the previous speaker talked about

478
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:49,010
machine learning maybe other

479
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:49,010
technologies

480
00:24:52,359 --> 00:25:00,168
so what can we accomplish doing this we

481
00:24:57,469 --> 00:25:03,999
can say that if we can say that the

482
00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:06,379
primary teacher does not depend on our

483
00:25:03,999 --> 00:25:10,429
infrastructure everything changes and

484
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:14,389
new equipment appears becomes and all

485
00:25:10,429 --> 00:25:18,649
the Whitman goes and this network

486
00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:21,349
includes its own life if we had if you

487
00:25:18,649 --> 00:25:24,049
had the experts of geometry and into the

488
00:25:21,349 --> 00:25:26,359
standard configuration we would cut

489
00:25:24,049 --> 00:25:29,899
ourselves we save ourselves the

490
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:34,249
dependence on little poetry since

491
00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:36,889
network telemetry is quite lightweight

492
00:25:34,249 --> 00:25:45,799
we can collect all the telemetry and in

493
00:25:36,889 --> 00:25:47,539
one place and analyze it as a whole we

494
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:50,209
will never end up in a situation when

495
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:52,239
the direction between two nodes of the

496
00:25:50,209 --> 00:25:54,739
network it was in one place the other

497
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:57,320
will be enlightened in other place of

498
00:25:54,739 --> 00:25:59,839
course we can parallelize this we can

499
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:02,718
distribute these computations but

500
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:10,609
primary data can be collected in one

501
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:12,979
place then we can need different trends

502
00:26:10,609 --> 00:26:16,519
we can plan the infrastructure and so on

503
00:26:12,979 --> 00:26:20,329
if we have statistics over a long period

504
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:22,249
of time we can see where the bandwidth

505
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:27,979
is not enough where our resources are

506
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:30,829
overloaded overstressed and the most

507
00:26:27,979 --> 00:26:34,089
important thing that we are all talking

508
00:26:30,829 --> 00:26:37,629
about today is the analysis of these

509
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:39,740
information flows the use of different

510
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:42,049
algorithms

511
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:44,779
different algorithms and the incident

512
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:51,110
response I was responding to incidents

513
00:26:44,779 --> 00:26:53,330
that have been I'm not going to spend

514
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:57,080
much time on the modern trends of course

515
00:26:53,330 --> 00:27:00,289
one of these trances being is increased

516
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:04,100
traffic to the mountains equipment is

517
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:08,110
grown SNMP monitoring are becoming less

518
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:12,580
and less chaotic over time if we try to

519
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:15,678
grab all network traffic you won't have

520
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:17,899
you won't have any capacity to process

521
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,149
it even with machine lorian's you won't

522
00:27:17,899 --> 00:27:22,340
be able to crunch it so I believe that

523
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:24,439
the system for the analysis of network

524
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:28,699
telemetry are promising technologies

525
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:31,039
that will allow us to to be successful

526
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:33,940
in the future also it should be said

527
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:36,830
that inter network marketers share of

528
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:40,010
devices that are able to generate this

529
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:43,220
and photometry is growing also received

530
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:46,640
growth in the amount of this equipment

531
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:49,760
that can customize what kind of

532
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:52,789
telemetry you want customized what

533
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:55,489
character limitary you get so as the

534
00:27:52,789 --> 00:27:59,029
previous colleague has said

535
00:27:55,489 --> 00:28:02,599
an important foundation of a parallel

536
00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:05,779
sister often what is profiling it means

537
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:08,570
that you choose a certain object and

538
00:28:05,779 --> 00:28:10,729
then you will define a set of metrics

539
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:13,879
for these objects and then you collect

540
00:28:10,729 --> 00:28:17,149
these metrics if we have a set of these

541
00:28:13,879 --> 00:28:24,168
profiles so we can compare them to each

542
00:28:17,149 --> 00:28:31,928
other over time and we can compare these

543
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:38,259
profiles with known anomalies with known

544
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:43,249
spreads and with known dangerous is

545
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:44,839
behavioral patterns so the next question

546
00:28:43,249 --> 00:28:47,029
you want to ask of course is what are we

547
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:49,190
going to profile we have a large zoo and

548
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:52,369
how do we choose the right thing from

549
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:54,889
the zoo what we want to profile the

550
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:57,639
different behavioral analysis systems

551
00:28:54,889 --> 00:29:04,549
allow you to profile different things

552
00:28:57,639 --> 00:29:08,119
starting from network nodes all the way

553
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:14,950
to network hubs all the way to more

554
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:17,839
complicated things so four parameters

555
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:23,419
some network equipment can generate for

556
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:27,339
example n bar to application tags or you

557
00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:30,099
can you can create these profiles of for

558
00:29:27,339 --> 00:29:32,450
applications with secure applications

559
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:34,729
what are the metrics so starting from

560
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:40,490
the standard ones such as the amount of

561
00:29:34,729 --> 00:29:42,740
data transfer ports several drivers

562
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:47,760
the use of different information

563
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:53,460
services and thesaurus research is Dina

564
00:29:47,760 --> 00:30:04,980
DHCP AARP and so on there is no point

565
00:29:53,460 --> 00:30:07,530
for some URL it's not it doesn't make

566
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:11,280
sense to measure the amount of data sent

567
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:13,170
over URL if it's just so if it's just

568
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:20,010
some service that doesn't interest us at

569
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:23,120
all so we ended up needing a compromise

570
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:26,370
it is impossible to profile everything

571
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:29,189
because that's gonna require just you

572
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:31,409
know the bottom resources metric so you

573
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:35,160
can store all the metrics so that s too

574
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:37,560
much data you are able to process it and

575
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:42,590
another important point is how much time

576
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:42,590
do we spend to its keep these profiles

577
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:50,370
but what if our reporting is once a year

578
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:51,510
do we need to keep these profiles for

579
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:54,719
the entire year

580
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:57,660
on one hand well that would be the

581
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:01,500
obvious solution however some system

582
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:04,410
allow you to create a time table for the

583
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:07,800
different for example the last freaking

584
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:10,800
day of every year is an anomaly

585
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:12,450
anomalous activity in some application

586
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:17,100
and that's no no

587
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:21,840
so of course you can you can do

588
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:25,289
different things so you can strike the

589
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:32,879
right balance between the amount of data

590
00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:35,789
and the fullness of data and equality Oh

591
00:31:32,879 --> 00:31:38,279
what tasks what problems can your so

592
00:31:35,789 --> 00:31:41,970
love using this approach oh that's quite

593
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:46,080
obvious you can you can create maps of

594
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:49,429
networking you can create trends you can

595
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:53,309
detect all sorts of different anomalies

596
00:31:49,429 --> 00:31:57,149
nevertheless unfortunately there's no

597
00:31:53,309 --> 00:31:59,908
button doing everything right here now

598
00:31:57,149 --> 00:32:02,570
and well of course you will need to have

599
00:31:59,909 --> 00:32:05,009
expertise on data analysts or data

600
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:08,730
scientists and so on so forth so you'll

601
00:32:05,009 --> 00:32:12,809
still need some humans in the loop and

602
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:14,100
nevertheless in what applied areas you

603
00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:18,149
do these behavioral analysis

604
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:22,738
technologists work well I have come to

605
00:32:18,149 --> 00:32:26,488
believe that through the use of the

606
00:32:22,739 --> 00:32:28,259
model if you create the right model you

607
00:32:26,489 --> 00:32:31,889
can recover all the applied areas of

608
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:34,470
course for every area terrific

609
00:32:31,889 --> 00:32:39,949
infrastructure you need to to create a

610
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:43,080
custom solution some networks have more

611
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:45,929
did you determined that flows such as

612
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:49,549
SCADA corporate networks always

613
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:53,429
determined how much deterministic

614
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:55,590
in death centers and corporate networks

615
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:58,049
at a purposes of this analysis may be

616
00:32:55,590 --> 00:33:01,889
different if in corporate even corporate

617
00:32:58,049 --> 00:33:05,190
networks we want to find malware a a

618
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:08,010
network provider may not be interested

619
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:14,820
in looking for viruses it's not very

620
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:17,730
critical for the provider and the

621
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:19,860
behavioral analysis algorithms will be

622
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:24,510
different as a conclusion of my

623
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:26,189
presentation I'd like to focus on what

624
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:29,190
you need to take into account if you

625
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:32,340
want to introduce behavioral analysis

626
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:35,130
you need to focus on the quantitative

627
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:39,530
parameters such as the load that the

628
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:42,570
system will with will be able to handle

629
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:44,158
the threat model that's the second thing

630
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:49,080
what we were afraid of what we want to

631
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:55,140
look for 1 2 and what type of

632
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:57,439
infrastructure we have then we choose

633
00:33:55,140 --> 00:34:02,490
what we're going to profile which use

634
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:09,379
the set of amid a set of metrics and we

635
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:13,889
choose for how long we store the data so

636
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:18,049
we based on based on that we'll make our

637
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:22,409
choice thank you Pavel Thank You puggle

638
00:34:18,049 --> 00:34:28,079
nobody wants to ask a question well this

639
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:29,940
topic is so quite and trendy everybody

640
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:35,339
keeps talking about behavioral analysis

641
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:39,899
some or try some even try to deploy it

642
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:42,299
or people try to create analytics so

643
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:46,038
where this is going to work how to use

644
00:34:42,299 --> 00:34:52,018
these templates and what to do with it

645
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:54,779
well I made an overview of systems I

646
00:34:52,018 --> 00:34:57,808
have been involved in behavioral

647
00:34:54,779 --> 00:35:01,940
analysis of network flows since 2010 and

648
00:34:57,809 --> 00:35:05,579
everything I've shared so far is just a

649
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:13,349
snapshot of for what there is out there

650
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:17,420
in the market so what I have discussed

651
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:21,529
is doable is doable using the existent

652
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:23,279
with existence solutions in the market

653
00:35:21,529 --> 00:35:27,539
thank you very much for the presentation

654
00:35:23,279 --> 00:35:31,500
my question is this okay what if clients

655
00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:33,539
are mostly most interested in what do

656
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:36,599
they want to analyze most from Network

657
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:38,599
you know telemetry what clients what

658
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:45,960
plans

659
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:48,269
well enterprise corporate corporate it

660
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:51,529
starts with anomaly detection is looking

661
00:35:48,269 --> 00:35:56,788
for is Jumel we're looking for champions

662
00:35:51,529 --> 00:36:03,930
in other words in terms of traffic in

663
00:35:56,789 --> 00:36:11,400
terms of visiting certain URLs looking

664
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:14,339
for attackers or hackers within the

665
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,910
corporate network okay all right thank

666
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:21,660
you Paul

667
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:24,740
I'll come back to you later the next

668
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:29,069
speaker is about battalions expert of

669
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:34,279
Microsoft he will talk about the

670
00:36:29,069 --> 00:36:37,609
non-trivial topic that although we

671
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:44,269
introduce a lot of different systems but

672
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:44,269
for some odd reasons we all the time we

673
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:57,109
run up against problems hi everybody my

674
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:59,670
name is bum Lord in the Tech Center Oh

675
00:36:57,109 --> 00:37:01,680
Microsoft Microsoft Excel future works

676
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:04,619
in architecture and division most of my

677
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:09,149
time I spend talking to the client

678
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:12,640
through this - the biggest most

679
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:15,520
established Russian customer so

680
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,160
and I press the button and they get the

681
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,830
results okay

682
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:24,839
and I listen to them and them is the

683
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:30,880
story I fear perhaps not from every

684
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:39,190
inference but every other what and by

685
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:42,640
the way let's do a warm-up PDMS in this

686
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:45,280
room raise your hand 1 2 3 well to a few

687
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:48,100
because my message my message is going

688
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:51,910
to pay for them ok but I believe in you

689
00:37:48,100 --> 00:38:00,549
you will take this message I carry this

690
00:37:51,910 --> 00:38:07,620
message forward here's the story ok a

691
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:10,240
top manager attends a conference Sultan

692
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:12,910
and the gospel Sultan paints a beautiful

693
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:16,029
picture of the future and then the CEO

694
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:18,129
comes back in reached and has great

695
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:19,210
ideas that are going to be good for the

696
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:23,550
company

697
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:28,119
in terms in terms of transformation

698
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:32,020
these persons is the sole enthuse term

699
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:34,359
goes to his colleagues share ideas and

700
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:36,339
everybody says well that's so great we

701
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:40,960
all everybody needs everybody's happy

702
00:38:36,339 --> 00:38:44,859
and they have even found the budget but

703
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:48,790
there is one really small formal step to

704
00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:54,220
get approval from this weird guy we are

705
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:56,339
department that does security and then

706
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:58,689
there is this boring guy from the

707
00:38:56,339 --> 00:39:02,200
security department my desk right here

708
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:06,819
it says no you can't use oh why why does

709
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:09,129
he say so well because you can

710
00:39:06,819 --> 00:39:09,910
understand him from the point of view of

711
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:12,609
humans

712
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:17,920
ok ok you have decided to transform

713
00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:20,078
business without ok I'm going to show

714
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,960
you how to transform this transfer and

715
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:27,309
just get this but the business decision

716
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:28,720
maker doesn't like being told so he says

717
00:39:27,309 --> 00:39:32,140
but who are you

718
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:35,230
they use my money I earned this money I

719
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:37,960
create all sorts of ID to earn money to

720
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:39,160
pay paycheck for you by the way and you

721
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:43,570
were telling me this

722
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:49,060
ok I'm going to it and you end up

723
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:53,050
an award the business is not this but

724
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:56,290
this story is pretty a pretty frequent I

725
00:39:53,050 --> 00:40:01,720
I keep hearing stories like this all the

726
00:39:56,290 --> 00:40:05,400
time but if we okay reset human emotion

727
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:08,980
society if we think about why security

728
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:11,590
professionals are so conservative we

729
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:16,690
will see if we analyze that these people

730
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:19,930
these people are trying to retain their

731
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:22,660
point of control because without it

732
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:26,049
nothing will work out what's better for

733
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:30,490
a bank not to have a mobile bank or to

734
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:32,860
have a mobile vendor that will be pried

735
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:37,629
open with a nail and hackers will be

736
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:43,650
practicing on it the answer is clear is

737
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:43,650
there any Universal answer to this is a

738
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:56,850
button to me everything is not yet on

739
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:59,320
porous so in Microsoft we were unhappy

740
00:40:56,850 --> 00:41:04,000
to think about we have a hundred and

741
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:07,540
eighty thousand employees throughout the

742
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:11,200
world they crazy

743
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:17,680
geeks as they take these security

744
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:22,350
systems systems around the world and we

745
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:27,580
have we do have things to to protect IP

746
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:30,100
money and so on the work of security was

747
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:31,500
not fail but worse than hell

748
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:35,410
[Music]

749
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:38,170
you I don't know or the universal word

750
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:40,210
Universal answer to that could be but

751
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:44,200
I'm going to share with you what we have

752
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:46,630
done and what I'm saying when I'm

753
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:50,078
talking about how we see information

754
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:51,700
security I always point people to what

755
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,680
we have done because I can only share

756
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:56,669
what we have done our personally so when

757
00:41:53,680 --> 00:42:01,210
we transplant our information security

758
00:41:56,670 --> 00:42:05,250
into this Center combating cyber threats

759
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:07,450
we focused three on three things first

760
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:10,000
organizational aspects to determine it

761
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:16,720
abroad and if you want the mission of

762
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:19,660
this security service and people and the

763
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:22,779
third support is techno enable and

764
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:26,490
technologists and in my presentation I

765
00:42:22,779 --> 00:42:28,750
am NOT going to say anything about

766
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:30,640
technologists well how's it possible and

767
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:34,150
here's a guy from Microsoft and not

768
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:40,900
saying anything about technology that's

769
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:47,470
right well my my boss has told me not to

770
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:50,670
just joke you would agree with me that

771
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:55,558
technology is the best way to solve a

772
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:59,500
conflict between business and security

773
00:42:55,559 --> 00:43:02,589
so the security guys say you can do it

774
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:08,650
and the business say we need this we

775
00:43:02,589 --> 00:43:11,349
need that this approach doesn't worry it

776
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:16,170
doesn't work it's not all the solved

777
00:43:11,349 --> 00:43:20,050
using money so focus on people

778
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:25,050
people are going to make you secure yes

779
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:27,430
technologies technologies are important

780
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:29,620
technologies are important there are a

781
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:32,560
very many technologies we have

782
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:35,140
technologies that people have what

783
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:38,680
technologies you're going to use depends

784
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:41,980
on what you feel comfortable is living

785
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:45,540
with it doesn't matter whether you're

786
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:49,750
going to use some electric instrument

787
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:53,140
them tool or some I don't know any other

788
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:57,750
instrument the only thing that matters

789
00:43:53,140 --> 00:44:03,250
is the end result organizational aspect

790
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:07,600
the first and the most important task is

791
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:09,640
to ask them what they are here for and

792
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:11,259
then ask and then ask the business

793
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:15,520
inventor

794
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:18,430
ask them what they think security the

795
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:20,770
security department he is for you won't

796
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:24,819
believe how different these answers are

797
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:27,490
how how far away so they are from each

798
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:30,370
other if the security guys tell you that

799
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:33,939
we are to answer the questions of the

800
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:39,730
Federal Security Service well that's a

801
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:42,930
position but remember you need another

802
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:45,250
structure that will be in charge of

803
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:47,440
protecting against the separators

804
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:51,670
because somebody has to do it after all

805
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:54,280
no the answer in FSB khalsa but in terms

806
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:56,170
of business it has to be a constant with

807
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:59,800
a security center the security

808
00:44:56,170 --> 00:45:05,590
operations center what is important for

809
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:08,650
the business money IP reputation to

810
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:13,150
market share the trust of the client

811
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:16,180
center and back you are going some

812
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:24,190
business intelligence friends were being

813
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:26,410
attacked with we are under attack and

814
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:30,070
the attackers are trying to get at

815
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:32,290
something we wouldn't even imagine Hey

816
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:33,910
business guys do you know what that

817
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:37,150
means perhaps something changed in the

818
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:40,240
market that's the information that can

819
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:42,730
the associate provide to the business

820
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:45,160
business outside of the house so I

821
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:49,480
believe yes indeed we need to conduct

822
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:53,350
union and conduct exercises

823
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:58,570
twice maybe three times a year just like

824
00:45:53,350 --> 00:46:01,779
fire evacuation exercises so let's say

825
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:05,460
for example we are in a serious

826
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:08,740
situation we have we have I don't know a

827
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:14,050
serious incident what we do and if this

828
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:16,569
incident indeed happens happens we have

829
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:18,880
to decide who is going to be the point

830
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:23,070
of contact who is going to coordinate

831
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:30,280
this collaboration between the business

832
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:32,290
departments and the security guys if

833
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:34,510
there is some minor or suspicion that

834
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:37,779
there's an enormous activity no there is

835
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:40,810
no there's no need to raise alarm but

836
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:42,760
but if there's something serious then of

837
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:43,710
course the business the department need

838
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:46,020
to know

839
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:48,599
about this as soon as possible culture

840
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:50,880
culture is of course an important aspect

841
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:54,470
because without this as they say

842
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:57,480
corporate culture you know is is a cult

843
00:46:54,470 --> 00:47:00,770
corporate culture has all sorts of

844
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:07,559
regulations for breakfast

845
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:10,559
please use people wisely don't ask them

846
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:12,569
to do some routine stupid things that

847
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:16,020
could be automated do not dump

848
00:47:12,569 --> 00:47:19,040
everything you can everything you can on

849
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:23,700
the people just to keep their heads

850
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:27,058
clear unfortunately human beings are not

851
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:31,710
machine learning models that that a

852
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:34,470
better off that feel better the more

853
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:36,599
data you feed into it so it's the other

854
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:39,480
way around with human beings so if you

855
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:41,130
ask humans to create some stupid reports

856
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:46,200
just because they have always been done

857
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:48,329
yes they will be done but but that

858
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:50,460
doesn't put you in a better position so

859
00:47:48,329 --> 00:47:56,220
teamwork teamwork is an important thing

860
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:58,200
teamwork not only within soc between the

861
00:47:56,220 --> 00:48:00,899
different analyzed within it but also

862
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:03,779
with all sorts of Reddington pen testers

863
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:05,130
and perhaps you can think of creating a

864
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,270
purple team you've probably heard about

865
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:08,970
this term raise your hand if you've

866
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:12,500
heard this yeah there are some some

867
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:12,500
people that know what a purple team is

868
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:19,410
this is to conduct research just

869
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:21,980
remember in your infrastructure research

870
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:25,240
and third is

871
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:31,839
training very often in investigations

872
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:35,000
you're left with some gaps gaps of

873
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:36,799
unclarity or uncertainty these gaps of

874
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,290
uncertainty are the most interesting

875
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,550
things that's where you need to look for

876
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:42,410
that's what is where you need to

877
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:45,320
concentrate all your analytical

878
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:48,799
resources after the incident has been

879
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:51,530
resolved but they unless go there and

880
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:55,970
review these gaps will visit them and

881
00:48:51,530 --> 00:49:02,300
try to make sure that that this

882
00:48:55,970 --> 00:49:05,359
uncertainty is resolved matrix as a rule

883
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:07,910
everybody saying is great in so so when

884
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:11,480
how we're going to measure this the

885
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:13,670
performance of s shock operation and

886
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:17,240
business likes measuring things we have

887
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:21,760
a set of simple metrics attempt to

888
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:24,828
furnish time to mediate a number of

889
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:27,319
remediated incidents by the way

890
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:29,859
separately manually and automatically

891
00:49:27,319 --> 00:49:33,079
and the number of escalations between

892
00:49:29,859 --> 00:49:35,690
levels so the combination of the last

893
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:41,150
two things will allow us to identify if

894
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:45,170
some level of our stock overloaded if it

895
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:51,170
is like all the load is taken by a level

896
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:53,089
one analyst and the rest is not used

897
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:56,839
enough oh maybe the other way around

898
00:49:53,089 --> 00:49:59,779
there escalating incidents all the time

899
00:49:56,839 --> 00:50:01,730
at a level two level three analysts are

900
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:03,920
overloaded whereas a level one people

901
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:06,619
are just shifting their load than others

902
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:08,869
to understand the reason maybe some

903
00:50:06,619 --> 00:50:12,859
competencies are lacking maybe you

904
00:50:08,869 --> 00:50:15,140
should modify the organization's and the

905
00:50:12,859 --> 00:50:16,220
overall stock model looks quite

906
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:21,078
traditional

907
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:22,970
the tier one supports results in most

908
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:25,790
incidents where they define what

909
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:32,149
specifically happens if we escalation or

910
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:34,550
escalated highest level to t3 mostly is

911
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:37,609
mostly busy during correcting work

912
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:38,300
preparing for attacks that have not yet

913
00:50:37,609 --> 00:50:40,700
happened

914
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:43,730
but the information from all three tiers

915
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:50,118
can and must get into the automation

916
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:52,670
tools so we need to shift as many items

917
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:56,030
as possible to the category of well

918
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:58,940
known attacks that will not require

919
00:50:56,030 --> 00:51:01,819
massive employment of human resources

920
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:05,569
but rather be handled through automation

921
00:51:01,819 --> 00:51:08,390
tools motive s if you look higher than

922
00:51:05,569 --> 00:51:10,460
so we can say that on the one hand we

923
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:15,950
need an internal incident management

924
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:18,619
team because people who have been in the

925
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:22,098
major disaster situation will appreciate

926
00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:24,710
that the situation is quite nervous IT

927
00:51:22,099 --> 00:51:27,589
people start coming to security

928
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:30,349
specialists and start you know thrashing

929
00:51:27,589 --> 00:51:32,410
about asking work so when exactly you're

930
00:51:30,349 --> 00:51:35,000
going to fix everything it was specific

931
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:37,759
when when and when you should have

932
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:41,390
dedicated people for them to turn to

933
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:45,500
because other ones have to have clear

934
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:49,640
heads and work so there should be some

935
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:52,040
point of contact prearranged so that

936
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:53,598
people could go to and these people

937
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:56,150
should understand how to do business how

938
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:58,000
to interact maybe with the press if it's

939
00:51:56,150 --> 00:52:01,160
needed and so on so forth

940
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:05,470
and a threat intelligence the thing that

941
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:08,390
so you can't have enough you shouldn't

942
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:11,629
just restrict yourself to just

943
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:14,060
yourselves get in touch with external

944
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:14,800
vendors get as much information as you

945
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:18,790
can

946
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:22,150
it's very important so therefore if you

947
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:25,720
get two ways of conducting investigation

948
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:27,820
hut-1 and a cold one hot one is like

949
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:30,250
something has happened has happened in

950
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:33,610
that infrastructure the cold one is that

951
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:36,910
we've learned from the internet and deep

952
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:41,770
we're both from anywhere else that this

953
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:44,350
thing is becoming relevant let's try and

954
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:47,340
model this attack simulate this attack

955
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:49,330
on our infrastructure do a POC

956
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:52,210
investigation maybe develop some

957
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:54,069
automation tools that will help us get

958
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:58,150
protected from this kind of attack unit

959
00:52:54,070 --> 00:53:00,850
before we actually encounter it so what

960
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:03,070
are the action items for me to you or

961
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:10,390
say to you I mean representatives or

962
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:13,570
business units so firstly transform your

963
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:17,799
security team beforehand the earlier you

964
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:22,090
do it the easier is going to be for you

965
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:24,610
looking forward and the less painful oh

966
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:26,890
well this business transformation

967
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:29,110
approaches we first transform the

968
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:32,560
security team and then transform your

969
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:35,160
business focus on people people rather

970
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:38,350
than technologists will make your life

971
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:43,569
safe and secure there are no technology

972
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:46,150
in the market that would have a make it

973
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:48,160
safe for me buttons and everything will

974
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:50,560
define more than that we have a lot of

975
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:53,859
movies that attempts to make such a

976
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:56,110
system can lead to the emergence of

977
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:59,320
Skynet with terminators but don't rely

978
00:53:56,110 --> 00:54:03,070
on this people first and thirdly involve

979
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:08,760
security team early so it's not to allow

980
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:08,760
a situation where everybody has already

981
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:13,349
done everything and there was only

982
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:17,450
little steps

983
00:54:13,349 --> 00:54:22,140
to make forward thank you Thank You van

984
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:25,288
it's quite important that this year we

985
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:27,118
have the slogan breaking the constants

986
00:54:25,289 --> 00:54:29,190
and actually the vector is shifting if

987
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:32,690
the past I was saying here's a machine

988
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:36,869
let's learn people to use it so they

989
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:38,849
could move from manual day but

990
00:54:36,869 --> 00:54:40,979
automation then we implemented lots of

991
00:54:38,849 --> 00:54:43,319
technologies were saying that one

992
00:54:40,979 --> 00:54:45,058
technology is better than another one

993
00:54:43,319 --> 00:54:49,099
replacing people and now we're coming

994
00:54:45,059 --> 00:54:52,619
back to people again back I think this

995
00:54:49,099 --> 00:54:56,729
is quite an important aspect that

996
00:54:52,619 --> 00:55:00,779
security is really about people well

997
00:54:56,729 --> 00:55:04,140
you're welcome to a booth and we'll give

998
00:55:00,779 --> 00:55:07,289
you some paper posters firstly with this

999
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:10,288
slogan and secondly with our vision of

1000
00:55:07,289 --> 00:55:12,269
how we believe you should go bus service

1001
00:55:10,289 --> 00:55:14,549
security in the right way thank you

1002
00:55:12,269 --> 00:55:19,950
thank you any questions no questions

1003
00:55:14,549 --> 00:55:25,049
thank you very much as they say there

1004
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:26,999
was a good joke the cost the price of

1005
00:55:25,049 --> 00:55:29,880
observing the observer is much higher

1006
00:55:26,999 --> 00:55:32,308
than that of observing the process and

1007
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:36,319
now we're going to talk to Dimitri Conti

1008
00:55:32,309 --> 00:55:40,710
Belgium cunt about GM at staff called

1009
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:45,119
regarding the analysis of employee

1010
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:49,109
observation this is a hot topic every

1011
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:51,960
year it evokes an explosive interest in

1012
00:55:49,109 --> 00:55:54,239
both parties do we have DLP implement

1013
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:56,910
your sitting as desk at work it says do

1014
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:59,789
they have DLP running and if yes then

1015
00:55:56,910 --> 00:56:03,210
what is it doing and the security system

1016
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:05,910
well we've introduced DLP and what

1017
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:08,969
should we observe to see the things that

1018
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:09,719
are a real interest well colleagues good

1019
00:56:08,969 --> 00:56:12,210
afternoon

1020
00:56:09,719 --> 00:56:14,160
let me introduce myself once again my

1021
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:17,219
name is Dmitry candy bhavish am head of

1022
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:20,038
staff cook and today we're going to talk

1023
00:56:17,219 --> 00:56:22,710
about employee control controlling the

1024
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:26,130
users who are in the network I'll try to

1025
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:31,739
briefly explained the subject area and

1026
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:35,119
then I'll do a FAQ on DLP and other

1027
00:56:31,739 --> 00:56:39,599
technologies and I'll say a few words

1028
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:42,509
pitfalls and at the end I'll touch upon

1029
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:46,890
the question which is very important for

1030
00:56:42,509 --> 00:56:48,869
users it's about legal aspects okay the

1031
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:50,969
first thing I wanted to mention that we

1032
00:56:48,869 --> 00:56:52,979
have both internal internal threats and

1033
00:56:50,969 --> 00:56:57,329
part of some avenges are focusing more

1034
00:56:52,979 --> 00:57:03,569
on external threats from such abstract

1035
00:56:57,329 --> 00:57:06,749
hackers others focus on insiders we take

1036
00:57:03,569 --> 00:57:10,499
this statistic and spend some time on it

1037
00:57:06,749 --> 00:57:12,689
will see that in actual life of a number

1038
00:57:10,499 --> 00:57:14,578
of external attacks is growing on the

1039
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:18,049
one hand because darknet is growing a

1040
00:57:14,579 --> 00:57:20,670
lot of students joined a darknet and

1041
00:57:18,049 --> 00:57:23,460
there are quite a lot of attacks that

1042
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:26,249
don't really have any malevolent intent

1043
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:28,259
just for fun well that has the market of

1044
00:57:26,249 --> 00:57:31,979
espionage industrial espionage is

1045
00:57:28,259 --> 00:57:36,150
growing very fast so we always face the

1046
00:57:31,979 --> 00:57:40,129
risk related to our employees so we

1047
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:43,940
argued with our colleagues and peers and

1048
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:47,099
our opinion is that with every year

1049
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:49,640
hacking a system is becoming more and

1050
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:53,190
more difficult and basically

1051
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:55,828
novices like students would have hard

1052
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:59,460
time breaking a Cisco firewall so

1053
00:57:55,829 --> 00:58:02,640
therefore it is becoming easier to rely

1054
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:05,640
on social engineering extortion and

1055
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:10,078
things like that because you know here

1056
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:14,009
people are people and in our opinion of

1057
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:16,739
the shift is now going towards humans as

1058
00:58:14,009 --> 00:58:20,999
the weak link in the security

1059
00:58:16,739 --> 00:58:24,239
environment I would now mention the

1060
00:58:20,999 --> 00:58:26,729
risks that are linked to people inside

1061
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:28,619
firstly a very promising token is the

1062
00:58:26,729 --> 00:58:30,960
company that doesn't belong to the

1063
00:58:28,619 --> 00:58:32,800
company and users may not always agree

1064
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:35,500
with the company

1065
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:38,740
it can be an eaglet negligence so it can

1066
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:44,280
be just made a malevolent intent and the

1067
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:48,220
second thing is that people may you know

1068
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:53,170
skip working at the workstations if you

1069
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:55,350
don't control them I would know the

1070
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:58,180
internal fraud because it's so unique

1071
00:58:55,350 --> 00:59:01,150
and people have very good you know

1072
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:05,020
imagination but this is one of the big

1073
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:09,550
things a large company regardless of the

1074
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:11,740
line of business internal fraud is there

1075
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:14,500
you can't ignore its and there's a risk

1076
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:19,870
group that me you need to keep track of

1077
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:22,360
just understand how they behave and I

1078
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:25,060
mean if you observe people behavior you

1079
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:29,340
can identify these risk groups they go

1080
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:35,140
for fraud this is one of the vectors

1081
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:40,510
threat vectors not really the latest

1082
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:45,629
data I decided that it's quite enough so

1083
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:50,020
here we have a list of leakage channels

1084
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:55,510
periphery devices printers and the

1085
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:58,480
network was about a fence that the bane

1086
00:59:55,510 --> 01:00:00,970
of security system is mobile devices

1087
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:05,250
with cameras that I brought sober

1088
01:00:00,970 --> 01:00:07,480
employees inside the perimeter perimeter

1089
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:11,410
nobody knows how to do it other than

1090
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:13,770
using the old way of just taking away

1091
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:16,720
the phone as you enter the organization

1092
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:18,400
there are some tools that say we can

1093
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:19,839
protect at least understand who made

1094
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,820
pictures and which user had some

1095
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:25,000
documents but they all they operate

1096
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:26,590
under certain conditions and the there

1097
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,049
are no products like that in the Russian

1098
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:33,789
market and they're quite expensive

1099
01:00:29,049 --> 01:00:38,380
so the trend is to steal using a mobile

1100
01:00:33,789 --> 01:00:42,609
device and if the user also actually

1101
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:44,859
keeping an eye on users through cameras

1102
01:00:42,609 --> 01:00:46,808
and pictures laughter the best way and

1103
01:00:44,859 --> 01:00:49,390
it's difficult to fight this kind of

1104
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:51,819
fraud regarding approach there are two

1105
01:00:49,390 --> 01:00:54,459
approaches that we encounter in

1106
01:00:51,819 --> 01:00:56,140
companies either everything is learning

1107
01:00:54,459 --> 01:00:59,589
company so businesses know we're not

1108
01:00:56,140 --> 01:01:02,919
going to block anything let people do

1109
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:05,349
what they do use any information

1110
01:01:02,919 --> 01:01:08,828
channels it improves customer relations

1111
01:01:05,349 --> 01:01:11,079
because customers are comfortable using

1112
01:01:08,829 --> 01:01:13,269
whatsapp for instance the other approach

1113
01:01:11,079 --> 01:01:16,919
is the other extremity where you ban

1114
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:19,089
everything creates a whitelist of

1115
01:01:16,919 --> 01:01:20,859
applications of internet sites and

1116
01:01:19,089 --> 01:01:22,689
people are only allowed to use the

1117
01:01:20,859 --> 01:01:25,899
channel of communications that are

1118
01:01:22,689 --> 01:01:27,788
available so when you press people that

1119
01:01:25,899 --> 01:01:29,709
has it's exactly the situation where

1120
01:01:27,789 --> 01:01:32,289
they attempted to take the camera the

1121
01:01:29,709 --> 01:01:35,049
other way is the other extreme area

1122
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:38,709
extremis extremity extremity is where

1123
01:01:35,049 --> 01:01:41,889
people know just to do all sorts of odd

1124
01:01:38,709 --> 01:01:47,078
things and you need to do a lot of work

1125
01:01:41,889 --> 01:01:48,880
tracking them all sorts of logs if

1126
01:01:47,079 --> 01:01:50,769
everybody is going to use all sorts of

1127
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:54,969
messages you won't be able to intercept

1128
01:01:50,769 --> 01:01:56,549
them you can only use key loggers or

1129
01:01:54,969 --> 01:02:02,649
something like that

1130
01:01:56,549 --> 01:02:04,599
Akeelah if use a similar project mass

1131
01:02:02,649 --> 01:02:07,538
for a thousand machines you won't even

1132
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:11,769
be able to help to muster the resources

1133
01:02:07,539 --> 01:02:14,140
to keep it under control I think there

1134
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:16,779
should be a trade-off away

1135
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:19,299
to be used some of the functional

1136
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:22,360
functional blocks others should be

1137
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:26,710
regulated and you always have to be

1138
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:31,050
aware of a thing called a hole in the

1139
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:34,540
fence Francia can't block telegram you

1140
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:37,690
you block but you can't control you tell

1141
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:39,759
your colleagues that we don't use web

1142
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:42,420
mail from the workstation and use the

1143
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:48,730
cloud because it's not allowed and then

1144
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:50,230
you release like a rumor saying this

1145
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:52,600
channel is still opening with the

1146
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:58,090
recognition say it isn't and then you

1147
01:02:52,600 --> 01:03:03,610
can just open logs on dawkins being sent

1148
01:02:58,090 --> 01:03:05,950
to web to web mail and easily take

1149
01:03:03,610 --> 01:03:08,350
incidents out there or if and yeah if

1150
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:12,460
you say people you can't use telegram

1151
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:14,440
and launch it you viewer you may not

1152
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:16,270
restrict them from access but you can

1153
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:18,100
keep an eye on them as soon as somebody

1154
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:21,400
opens up telegram ourselves doing them

1155
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:23,020
just the fact of using telegram would be

1156
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,880
enough to make them eligible for the

1157
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:27,610
risk group so that he should apply logs

1158
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:29,320
and monitor their activities just a few

1159
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:31,270
words about it a couple of words about

1160
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:32,890
looking how we presented ourselves as

1161
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:34,360
monitoring system that's why our

1162
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:37,720
colleague from DLP don't like this

1163
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:39,130
content blocking doesn't work from my

1164
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:41,620
experience even though there are people

1165
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:42,970
who would never be with me why don't

1166
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:45,759
they want everyone else about false

1167
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:46,390
positives if you have a lot of false

1168
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:52,000
positives

1169
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:54,009
it must be divided by the time about the

1170
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,440
number of people processing of this

1171
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:58,570
these incidents in real time to allow

1172
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:01,240
reject the content considering how many

1173
01:03:58,570 --> 01:04:03,910
people have the security services and in

1174
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:08,069
IT departments two or three people at

1175
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:11,589
max so even if you have even a 500 users

1176
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:18,130
then your business process was off for a

1177
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:20,080
day so business will just ban you doing

1178
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:23,780
that

1179
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:24,200
so content-based blockings don't really

1180
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:28,220
work

1181
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:31,129
they only work for a small segments of

1182
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:33,620
the networks and if you have some

1183
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:35,420
valuable information you can only

1184
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:37,750
restrict you to certain perimeter and

1185
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:40,550
set up looking there

1186
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:43,850
so channels blow channel blocking it

1187
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:46,550
works better because as I explained the

1188
01:04:43,850 --> 01:04:49,009
whole in defense principles for looking

1189
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:51,590
I think labels work best when you tag

1190
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:54,530
the information let's see how valuable

1191
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:58,400
for them for you and us set up

1192
01:04:54,530 --> 01:05:02,180
restrictions for this information to be

1193
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:04,520
accessed by users so a person for

1194
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:08,290
instance can run a certain document only

1195
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:13,190
in verb in words and not any other tools

1196
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:17,060
so the blocking works at the tag or

1197
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:19,490
label level if we take IT people

1198
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:21,950
security people until security people

1199
01:05:19,490 --> 01:05:24,649
the effect of blocking is a good thing

1200
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:27,049
you've locked and no problem but if we

1201
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:29,240
talk about a security service even a

1202
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:33,490
sending a letter with an important

1203
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:37,580
anymore with an important attachment is

1204
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:40,759
just the break of regulation of the

1205
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:50,509
company won't be able to prove that it

1206
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:54,170
was really a something that person

1207
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:56,180
something serious so security people

1208
01:05:54,170 --> 01:05:58,430
need to have a pool a full body of

1209
01:05:56,180 --> 01:06:01,549
evidence this by the way is about

1210
01:05:58,430 --> 01:06:03,410
looking and content analysis is quite a

1211
01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:05,890
compute intensive thing those people who

1212
01:06:03,410 --> 01:06:09,589
don't do P and then they perfectly know

1213
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:14,330
how user desktops start working slowly

1214
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:16,640
if lots of such programs run and them so

1215
01:06:14,330 --> 01:06:20,319
this approach a content-based blocking

1216
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:23,359
is going out of practice for all these

1217
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:26,080
restrictions so much about channels and

1218
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:31,390
information leaks

1219
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:34,990
the second approach is about timekeeping

1220
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:36,370
work timekeeping people start thinking

1221
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:39,580
about that especially business because

1222
01:06:36,370 --> 01:06:41,470
if we take look at the exhibition for

1223
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:43,810
the past three years when you ask people

1224
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:46,330
are you interested in time work

1225
01:06:43,810 --> 01:06:48,279
timekeeping they used to say no now

1226
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:51,549
eight out of ten say yes so the business

1227
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:53,740
is trying is starting to look for points

1228
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:55,960
of growth so what's this slide about so

1229
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:58,600
we're sitting around the table those

1230
01:06:55,960 --> 01:07:01,330
guys from IT IT security and we had a

1231
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:03,460
discussion about IT budgets how to get

1232
01:07:01,330 --> 01:07:07,690
them how to persuade the management to

1233
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:10,000
me as a lawyer and a speaker I have one

1234
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:12,430
kind of model so my brain works in y

1235
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:15,430
direction technical guys for them

1236
01:07:12,430 --> 01:07:17,259
numbers and finance things that they

1237
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:20,799
don't quite understand so as a

1238
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:24,520
discussion we arrived at second sentence

1239
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:29,530
that any process can be translated to

1240
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:32,050
the language of expenses and benefits

1241
01:07:29,530 --> 01:07:34,330
and business intelligence when you say

1242
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:37,420
it's the problem of performance and they

1243
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:39,819
say yeah I know I have half of the

1244
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:42,700
people who are lazy bones but they don't

1245
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:45,250
notice the scale I am showing some

1246
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:48,460
statistic that shows the scale of

1247
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:50,940
problems it was an anonymous poet haba

1248
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:54,130
haba people ask how much time do you use

1249
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:57,070
in your worst fate in a workstation I

1250
01:07:54,130 --> 01:07:59,140
usually ask other workaholics in the

1251
01:07:57,070 --> 01:08:01,930
room there are six people like this

1252
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:04,660
other people in the room who allow a

1253
01:08:01,930 --> 01:08:08,379
couple of hours a day for personal

1254
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:10,810
development for reading reading some

1255
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:14,110
professional editions the whole room

1256
01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:17,200
usually raises their hands and listen

1257
01:08:14,110 --> 01:08:19,540
visitors and other people who come to

1258
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:22,330
work and spend half their time at the

1259
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:26,910
desk or maybe just drinking tea and

1260
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:29,500
smoking nobody says yes but anonymous

1261
01:08:26,910 --> 01:08:31,510
polls say that there are 60 people like

1262
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:33,640
this one we try to explain this to

1263
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:37,239
business they start thinking about this

1264
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:38,830
but because people doing business

1265
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:42,160
really are not really good at

1266
01:08:38,830 --> 01:08:43,778
calculating we offer them in an

1267
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:46,599
opportunity of translating this data

1268
01:08:43,779 --> 01:08:48,310
into money if we don't take this extreme

1269
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:52,239
which is saying that half people in this

1270
01:08:48,310 --> 01:08:55,630
room it doesn't work in the workplace we

1271
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:58,778
can just calculate how business would

1272
01:08:55,630 --> 01:09:01,839
much more business would lose if people

1273
01:08:58,779 --> 01:09:04,239
spend two hours a day not working so we

1274
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:08,850
take this picture and the most important

1275
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:12,009
thing here is that so

1276
01:09:08,850 --> 01:09:15,700
it's about multiplying two things

1277
01:09:12,009 --> 01:09:17,380
these are losses related to business not

1278
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:20,649
being able to control large departments

1279
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:23,350
when they see that those numbers they

1280
01:09:20,649 --> 01:09:27,759
started standing at a scale problem so

1281
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:31,630
we don't use this light to speak about

1282
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:34,270
lost profits actually you could make

1283
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:37,239
this formula make this algorithm much

1284
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:43,089
more sophisticated but the reason I'm

1285
01:09:37,238 --> 01:09:48,189
invoking this is that any risk can be

1286
01:09:43,089 --> 01:09:50,620
translated in to specific numbers same

1287
01:09:48,189 --> 01:09:53,009
thing and selling any IT product you can

1288
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:55,570
say how much it will cost your company

1289
01:09:53,009 --> 01:09:58,210
if servers are down

1290
01:09:55,570 --> 01:10:03,070
it cannot be translated into money terms

1291
01:09:58,210 --> 01:10:05,440
so it's so about my claim that any idea

1292
01:10:03,070 --> 01:10:09,340
project should we translate into the

1293
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:11,710
language of money now about

1294
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:14,560
functionality firstly a couple words

1295
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:16,510
there are gateway based systems battery

1296
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:22,900
stolen gateways unfortunately that time

1297
01:10:16,510 --> 01:10:25,330
is up almost up because you will only be

1298
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:28,330
able to control the email with the

1299
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:29,980
clouds and second system is patient

1300
01:10:28,330 --> 01:10:32,070
endpoints endpoints a good thing

1301
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:34,179
collects lots of data not only about the

1302
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:38,429
movement information but also about

1303
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:38,430
programming started audio

1304
01:10:38,969 --> 01:10:44,860
messaging it covers the entire

1305
01:10:41,099 --> 01:10:47,469
functionality so what's up it is can we

1306
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:49,058
encounter here if you are purchasing a

1307
01:10:47,469 --> 01:10:53,400
solution that based on the thick client

1308
01:10:49,059 --> 01:10:56,199
and most product unfortunately have this

1309
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:58,780
huge technology

1310
01:10:56,199 --> 01:11:01,719
Taylan companies experienced

1311
01:10:58,780 --> 01:11:04,059
difficulties in just as severing they're

1312
01:11:01,719 --> 01:11:08,650
cutting it away so if you buy a solution

1313
01:11:04,059 --> 01:11:11,949
based on modern technology SAS not in

1314
01:11:08,650 --> 01:11:14,400
terms of the server being stolen

1315
01:11:11,949 --> 01:11:19,030
premises but a customer being fair

1316
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:20,679
connected to the to the network so you

1317
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:22,739
get the opportunity of collecting this

1318
01:11:20,679 --> 01:11:24,039
information that without logging every

1319
01:11:22,739 --> 01:11:26,888
device

1320
01:11:24,039 --> 01:11:28,869
the second thing another thing is that

1321
01:11:26,889 --> 01:11:31,689
these systems don't consume enough

1322
01:11:28,869 --> 01:11:33,159
resources everybody of you haven't got a

1323
01:11:31,689 --> 01:11:35,559
situation that you've drawn up your

1324
01:11:33,159 --> 01:11:37,869
budget and paper in licenses and other

1325
01:11:35,559 --> 01:11:39,539
things and as a result your spending is

1326
01:11:37,869 --> 01:11:41,860
much higher because you haven't

1327
01:11:39,539 --> 01:11:44,530
completely and consider the

1328
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:46,179
infrastructure the database hardware and

1329
01:11:44,530 --> 01:11:48,309
also the service of those are going to

1330
01:11:46,179 --> 01:11:51,760
do that the big problem with the OB

1331
01:11:48,309 --> 01:11:57,639
system is that they're costly and they

1332
01:11:51,760 --> 01:12:00,389
need hard hard well the vector of import

1333
01:11:57,639 --> 01:12:04,420
substitution has been taken us by

1334
01:12:00,389 --> 01:12:07,030
because we understood that the future is

1335
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:11,079
with open source so we have about to

1336
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:14,188
have post press we now subsidies click

1337
01:12:11,079 --> 01:12:17,289
house and it is it has become possible

1338
01:12:14,189 --> 01:12:19,269
to bypass all the difficulties by

1339
01:12:17,289 --> 01:12:21,880
selecting fully open source products

1340
01:12:19,269 --> 01:12:23,709
another big boon about this technology

1341
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:28,179
is that we have an open stack and when

1342
01:12:23,709 --> 01:12:31,420
the server side is open you can take any

1343
01:12:28,179 --> 01:12:35,280
data to either download or upload data

1344
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:35,280
for instance use domain v ID

1345
01:12:36,489 --> 01:12:40,718
or for timekeeping furnaces you can

1346
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:43,930
synchronize it with the Outlook calendar

1347
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:47,400
so there are two challenges here the

1348
01:12:43,930 --> 01:12:50,710
infrastructure being expensive which

1349
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:54,099
discourages people to use the LPS and

1350
01:12:50,710 --> 01:12:59,230
complexity of its a setting up talking

1351
01:12:54,100 --> 01:13:02,040
about NPO the best things is you start

1352
01:12:59,230 --> 01:13:07,959
being able to see what people are doing

1353
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:10,540
with the information documents you you

1354
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:13,719
can make a shadow copy of everything and

1355
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:19,150
you can set up alerts on the content of

1356
01:13:13,719 --> 01:13:22,810
the files also it's a pure DLP saying

1357
01:13:19,150 --> 01:13:25,170
it's within the competence of IT and IT

1358
01:13:22,810 --> 01:13:29,380
security but an experience shows

1359
01:13:25,170 --> 01:13:33,610
internal fraud for to fight internal

1360
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:36,850
flow the classic DLP is not enough so

1361
01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:39,549
any business owner know isn't a business

1362
01:13:36,850 --> 01:13:42,670
owner is going to spend their money on a

1363
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:45,460
DLP if it doesn't address the biggest

1364
01:13:42,670 --> 01:13:49,360
problems the functionality mentioned

1365
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:53,100
here messaging control microphones

1366
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:55,780
camera so these tools have become

1367
01:13:53,100 --> 01:14:00,810
absolutely indispensable tools used in

1368
01:13:55,780 --> 01:14:05,519
DOP so this these logs are used for

1369
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:08,230
security people outside pure IT security

1370
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:12,610
so for instance you can't a large

1371
01:14:08,230 --> 01:14:16,989
company is a big company and say do you

1372
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:20,019
use microphone control they said no so

1373
01:14:16,989 --> 01:14:21,790
you've collected this log it it's being

1374
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:23,980
stored is good

1375
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:26,080
it's can usually be defined by common

1376
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:31,440
config files so what can do with this

1377
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:36,120
long log file firstly a you become

1378
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:39,370
capable to run incident investigations

1379
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:41,640
to understand the dynamic who was

1380
01:14:39,370 --> 01:14:43,530
involved it's very good things

1381
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:46,080
a second thing if you have a large log

1382
01:14:43,530 --> 01:14:48,330
file no just allow you to visualize it

1383
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:50,820
so you can take a look at dependencies

1384
01:14:48,330 --> 01:14:53,580
between different employees you can take

1385
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:58,380
a look you can track the distribution of

1386
01:14:53,580 --> 01:15:00,000
documents you can see outliers so it

1387
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:02,580
works very well

1388
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:06,630
specific DLP that keeps an eye on a

1389
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:09,620
certain document as then a person you

1390
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:12,030
know resigns from the company I start

1391
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:13,830
downloading information if there's no

1392
01:15:12,030 --> 01:15:15,450
document there you won't be able to

1393
01:15:13,830 --> 01:15:19,230
confirm this but if you set up your

1394
01:15:15,450 --> 01:15:21,599
anomaly for the email or for the ESP

1395
01:15:19,230 --> 01:15:23,250
device and the cloud you can identify

1396
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,170
like for instance the person has never

1397
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:27,840
used the cloud and then they start to

1398
01:15:25,170 --> 01:15:31,340
upload a huge amount of data this

1399
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:35,580
approach works very very well

1400
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:37,920
alongside specific rules of document

1401
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:39,930
management these widgets offer your

1402
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:42,390
great opportunity to process large

1403
01:15:39,930 --> 01:15:44,610
volatile data and identify risk groups

1404
01:15:42,390 --> 01:15:48,420
if an incident has already happened it's

1405
01:15:44,610 --> 01:15:50,670
clear identified investigated but you

1406
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:52,230
also need to work proactively and these

1407
01:15:50,670 --> 01:15:54,650
things are just like big data

1408
01:15:52,230 --> 01:15:58,230
visualization is a big helper to our

1409
01:15:54,650 --> 01:16:00,650
security officers and of course it's

1410
01:15:58,230 --> 01:16:03,540
very difficult to do it all manually

1411
01:16:00,650 --> 01:16:05,910
considering especially that you don't

1412
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:09,240
have enough people of course automatic

1413
01:16:05,910 --> 01:16:13,590
alerts need to be there oh that's can be

1414
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:16,650
the set up in DLP buy masks that's one

1415
01:16:13,590 --> 01:16:18,180
thing also you can set them up to target

1416
01:16:16,650 --> 01:16:21,269
any event of interest to you for

1417
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:24,480
instance you are interested in sending

1418
01:16:21,270 --> 01:16:28,800
some documents from the digital archive

1419
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:30,990
using web mail so you said you described

1420
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:33,330
this event you set it up in the filter

1421
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:37,349
and every time it happens again you'll

1422
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:41,160
be getting an alert also anomalies may

1423
01:16:37,350 --> 01:16:44,490
not make me depend on just some

1424
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:46,920
activities that you don't allow also we

1425
01:16:44,490 --> 01:16:49,950
collect information about the work time

1426
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:52,410
control it's a very useful thing even

1427
01:16:49,950 --> 01:16:54,660
Faye's when people are taking a free

1428
01:16:52,410 --> 01:16:58,230
pallet for several months they get great

1429
01:16:54,660 --> 01:17:02,030
consulting and audit of the to identify

1430
01:16:58,230 --> 01:17:05,129
the worst people in their organization

1431
01:17:02,030 --> 01:17:09,120
so basically this smoke a little bit of

1432
01:17:05,130 --> 01:17:16,020
consulting can strongly affect your work

1433
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:18,090
and punish the perpetrators and at least

1434
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:20,580
a you can bring a beautiful report to

1435
01:17:18,090 --> 01:17:25,290
your management after this pilot with

1436
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:30,690
specific losses assessed so the last

1437
01:17:25,290 --> 01:17:33,510
area is about endpoint machines you can

1438
01:17:30,690 --> 01:17:36,870
remotely manage them you can download

1439
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:41,000
enough information you can set up port

1440
01:17:36,870 --> 01:17:44,640
blocking blocking the capability to

1441
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:48,690
connect additional devices this is the

1442
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:52,560
base set of tasks that goes way beyond

1443
01:17:48,690 --> 01:17:56,190
DLP it actually allows a working over

1444
01:17:52,560 --> 01:18:01,790
the program for several departments HR

1445
01:17:56,190 --> 01:18:07,469
for instance security ports and systems

1446
01:18:01,790 --> 01:18:09,540
that will be for IT so this approach let

1447
01:18:07,470 --> 01:18:11,780
me know proceed to what concerns are

1448
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:14,360
calling the most the legal component of

1449
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:18,750
having such a system implemented

1450
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:24,299
unfortunately in this country we have

1451
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:26,640
not too many judicial practices to

1452
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:30,900
exchange no consist a gray zone on the

1453
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:34,440
one hand we have laws that directly not

1454
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:37,519
allow us to control personal information

1455
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:39,990
it's in the criminal code it was

1456
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:42,480
unconstitutional but I would like to

1457
01:18:39,990 --> 01:18:45,260
also point out that the government has

1458
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:48,299
started moving in this direction

1459
01:18:45,260 --> 01:18:51,780
propose a law that's going to be a read

1460
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:53,970
soon that better explains so what

1461
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:57,480
special means are if you look at the

1462
01:18:53,970 --> 01:18:59,940
footnote it better explains what it may

1463
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:05,309
be this can be a technical devices can

1464
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:07,500
be a piece of software that yes that has

1465
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:12,780
the properties of being able to collect

1466
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:16,470
information correctly so yeah if it gets

1467
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:19,950
passed then that complicates things but

1468
01:19:16,470 --> 01:19:22,470
the most important documents regulating

1469
01:19:19,950 --> 01:19:26,190
the relationship between the employee

1470
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:34,650
and the employer is the labor law so we

1471
01:19:26,190 --> 01:19:38,160
are in very tight conditions so the

1472
01:19:34,650 --> 01:19:42,710
criminal code only concerns personal

1473
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:46,889
information so you have to be able to

1474
01:19:42,710 --> 01:19:51,600
you have to be able to transition or

1475
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:55,550
transfer personal into public into kind

1476
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:58,370
of service so you can be able to monitor

1477
01:19:55,550 --> 01:20:01,230
information in terms of compliance

1478
01:19:58,370 --> 01:20:04,140
compliance with anti-corruption law

1479
01:20:01,230 --> 01:20:09,450
antitrust laws as soon as you give a

1480
01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:12,170
person a paper that says that okay we

1481
01:20:09,450 --> 01:20:14,970
have commercial secrets we'll be able to

1482
01:20:12,170 --> 01:20:17,689
monitor for this so we have to monitor

1483
01:20:14,970 --> 01:20:22,329
the technical communication

1484
01:20:17,689 --> 01:20:26,360
and channels and the person should

1485
01:20:22,329 --> 01:20:32,090
expressly agree as that he doesn't mind

1486
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:35,959
being monitored and this document should

1487
01:20:32,090 --> 01:20:41,809
also say that the person agrees that he

1488
01:20:35,959 --> 01:20:44,869
or she will be a reliable for you know

1489
01:20:41,809 --> 01:20:49,519
transferring information and channels

1490
01:20:44,869 --> 01:20:52,268
along the channels that not a service

1491
01:20:49,519 --> 01:20:57,709
then that person will be a subject to

1492
01:20:52,269 --> 01:20:59,719
reliability but okay this is just a

1493
01:20:57,709 --> 01:21:02,389
document as well let the persons know

1494
01:20:59,719 --> 01:21:05,719
that there won't be any unchecked

1495
01:21:02,389 --> 01:21:08,469
surveillance it's just going to be a

1496
01:21:05,719 --> 01:21:13,119
document waiting the person know that

1497
01:21:08,469 --> 01:21:16,340
the information must be protected and

1498
01:21:13,119 --> 01:21:18,909
the employer reserves the right to

1499
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:24,110
monitor the compliance with these

1500
01:21:18,909 --> 01:21:27,848
non-disclosure agreements so if you want

1501
01:21:24,110 --> 01:21:31,688
to use it to increase efficiency and to

1502
01:21:27,849 --> 01:21:37,880
prevent the motivation you can do this

1503
01:21:31,689 --> 01:21:42,499
as an icon in d'etre if so the person

1504
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:46,729
the person should be confident that this

1505
01:21:42,499 --> 01:21:50,030
surveillance this surveillance is within

1506
01:21:46,729 --> 01:21:56,000
reasonable limits it's

1507
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:57,860
is not not excessive and you can display

1508
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:04,490
all sorts of notifications and the

1509
01:21:57,860 --> 01:22:08,630
trades and so on and the person has to

1510
01:22:04,490 --> 01:22:12,019
be confident that the logs should never

1511
01:22:08,630 --> 01:22:16,480
be should never be given to court or

1512
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:19,900
anything or any other for any other

1513
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:24,469
organizations or law enforcement

1514
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:26,210
unfortunately many companies do this in

1515
01:22:24,470 --> 01:22:31,220
a covert fashion so in other words they

1516
01:22:26,210 --> 01:22:33,530
don't even know wet as they don't they

1517
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:38,330
don't announce to the employees that

1518
01:22:33,530 --> 01:22:41,150
they are under surveillance and yes you

1519
01:22:38,330 --> 01:22:44,630
can do so but if there is a breach of

1520
01:22:41,150 --> 01:22:46,960
security or something a stolen you will

1521
01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:49,340
not be able to go to court and present

1522
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:51,530
your evidence that you have collected

1523
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:54,470
while in doing surveillance on the print

1524
01:22:51,530 --> 01:22:59,860
on the person or on your employees I

1525
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:59,860
have talked about this colleagues if you

1526
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:09,380
if you surveil your employees of course

1527
01:23:06,410 --> 01:23:16,220
you have to keep this a secret

1528
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:22,010
and if you do do so if you do choose to

1529
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:24,950
surveil your employees openly then you

1530
01:23:22,010 --> 01:23:30,190
have to of course protect yourself by

1531
01:23:24,950 --> 01:23:35,429
having them signed so-called documents

1532
01:23:30,190 --> 01:23:38,379
so everybody everybody I mean every

1533
01:23:35,430 --> 01:23:41,880
employee of your company should be

1534
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:46,840
completely aware that he or she is being

1535
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:49,560
monitored so there should be a consensus

1536
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:55,510
between the employee and the employer

1537
01:23:49,560 --> 01:24:00,310
any questions I see there are lots of

1538
01:23:55,510 --> 01:24:04,420
questions quick questions okay are there

1539
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:08,020
any ways to monitor file shares no we

1540
01:24:04,420 --> 01:24:11,170
don't have any crawlers because we don't

1541
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:16,890
know how to accomplish to implement a

1542
01:24:11,170 --> 01:24:22,430
technologically okay a person's sticks a

1543
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:23,550
flash disk into a USB port and what else

1544
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:30,280
[Music]

1545
01:24:23,550 --> 01:24:41,920
it's it's not clear how to how to handle

1546
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:45,160
those cases we take data from husb

1547
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:48,820
devices and you can even connect to a

1548
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:51,460
specific computer if you are doing an

1549
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:56,670
incident response or if you do it

1550
01:24:51,460 --> 01:25:01,320
investigation we don't use crawlers for

1551
01:24:56,670 --> 01:25:02,500
cloud services such as a Google cloud

1552
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:07,620
gdpr

1553
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:11,230
is a serious hurdle here so perhaps by

1554
01:25:07,620 --> 01:25:14,340
by the fall we will be able to deploy

1555
01:25:11,230 --> 01:25:14,339
something but not now

1556
01:25:19,890 --> 01:25:27,730
pain isn't a person does with Network

1557
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:33,250
folders you will be able to see this but

1558
01:25:27,730 --> 01:25:36,429
we only create shadow copy of a document

1559
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:40,480
if the person has tampered with these

1560
01:25:36,430 --> 01:25:45,120
documents we're we don't consider this

1561
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:50,379
in any serious way now the CTO of Wacom

1562
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:52,360
two hours ago in the out of room they

1563
01:25:50,380 --> 01:25:55,270
were there was a question about GOP

1564
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:58,960
phobia so so what a feature said can be

1565
01:25:55,270 --> 01:26:01,690
offered to VIPs to companies top

1566
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:04,960
managers that just don't don't want to

1567
01:26:01,690 --> 01:26:07,900
let anyone in on their data thank you

1568
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:10,300
very much for the question yes that's a

1569
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:12,900
very relevant question it has a

1570
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:19,120
technical dimension and other dimensions

1571
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:22,240
many VIPs are Mac OS Mac OS is a closed

1572
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:30,880
system it's a proprietary system it is

1573
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:33,370
impossible to embed loggers such as to

1574
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:37,750
any loggers voice recorders and it's

1575
01:26:33,370 --> 01:26:41,290
very hard to technically control VIPs in

1576
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:44,170
fact the main is a and by the way they

1577
01:26:41,290 --> 01:26:45,970
pose the main threat of the main risk

1578
01:26:44,170 --> 01:26:48,010
because they have access to money and

1579
01:26:45,970 --> 01:26:50,230
direct access to money if there are no

1580
01:26:48,010 --> 01:26:53,380
technical problems so then the next

1581
01:26:50,230 --> 01:26:56,919
question is who is the customer if the

1582
01:26:53,380 --> 01:27:00,880
customer is the owner or if the offer is

1583
01:26:56,920 --> 01:27:04,270
a shareholder they will of course will

1584
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:07,990
be monitoring VIPs in the first place

1585
01:27:04,270 --> 01:27:09,400
but if the customer took the top

1586
01:27:07,990 --> 01:27:11,980
managers themselves they will be

1587
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:14,809
controlling anyone but themselves that

1588
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:20,150
is that

1589
01:27:14,810 --> 01:27:24,160
a problem for the security department

1590
01:27:20,150 --> 01:27:29,420
yes but the problem is briefly is real

1591
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:33,880
it is relevant a ok move all discuss

1592
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:36,200
these questions by at the end of our

1593
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:39,380
sessions if you have more questions

1594
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:42,440
please come to our booth and I'll be

1595
01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:44,540
happy to take your questions ok

1596
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:50,660
we will go back to the principle of

1597
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:57,980
breaking the constant very few people

1598
01:27:50,660 --> 01:28:02,630
know that in order to maintain in order

1599
01:27:57,980 --> 01:28:06,769
to create a city for hackers here with

1600
01:28:02,630 --> 01:28:11,300
noise with parallel networks so that it

1601
01:28:06,770 --> 01:28:14,330
is impossible to find a target all of

1602
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:18,290
that requires a lot of computational

1603
01:28:14,330 --> 01:28:21,559
resources and fast systems I'd like to

1604
01:28:18,290 --> 01:28:25,519
invite here and record in skill of a

1605
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:29,450
wooden system he will talk about data

1606
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:31,940
storage systems at the present the

1607
01:28:29,450 --> 01:28:38,260
company and I'd like to say that this

1608
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:42,580
standoff was now organized by violence

1609
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:42,580
and everything works very well

1610
01:28:42,610 --> 01:28:48,670
good afternoon please don't go away it's

1611
01:28:46,930 --> 01:28:55,990
gonna be more presentation this is not

1612
01:28:48,670 --> 01:28:58,390
the most boring one of them okay we have

1613
01:28:55,990 --> 01:29:00,519
happy to provide our debt storage system

1614
01:28:58,390 --> 01:29:03,280
for this event I'm here for the first

1615
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:07,000
time and really impressed I'm impressed

1616
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:09,300
by the scale by the number of

1617
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:19,240
participants and vendors and partners

1618
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:21,730
and indeed we we provided our solar

1619
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:27,910
system it's the most high-performance

1620
01:29:21,730 --> 01:29:29,919
it's the fastest perhaps you're you're

1621
01:29:27,910 --> 01:29:33,340
not from the right audience but anyway

1622
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:36,330
when I talk to customers I had realized

1623
01:29:33,340 --> 01:29:43,470
that the business people security guys

1624
01:29:36,330 --> 01:29:47,769
they play important role so security is

1625
01:29:43,470 --> 01:29:52,740
one of their consumers and one of the

1626
01:29:47,770 --> 01:29:52,740
customers and one of the main

1627
01:29:55,930 --> 01:30:03,860
clubs that make sure that everything

1628
01:29:58,910 --> 01:30:08,000
works oil company company violent has

1629
01:30:03,860 --> 01:30:13,849
been on the market has been active in

1630
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:19,810
the market since 2000 since 2005 it has

1631
01:30:13,850 --> 01:30:24,440
created the fastest that storage system

1632
01:30:19,810 --> 01:30:28,400
originally it was an in-memory storage

1633
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:31,519
system without any hard drives and since

1634
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:35,860
then with this company violin has been

1635
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:40,970
actually developed in this concept and

1636
01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:45,980
just a year ago this company became

1637
01:30:40,970 --> 01:30:48,890
really ramping up its activities it

1638
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:53,509
became more and more popular so

1639
01:30:48,890 --> 01:31:00,850
everywhere you need high performance

1640
01:30:53,510 --> 01:31:05,300
that's the system of choice well a

1641
01:31:00,850 --> 01:31:09,620
certain time ago hybrid system disk

1642
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:13,570
systems were quite popular they were

1643
01:31:09,620 --> 01:31:15,860
cheap but they were slow now but the

1644
01:31:13,570 --> 01:31:19,460
required performance requirements for

1645
01:31:15,860 --> 01:31:21,980
input/output has really increased and it

1646
01:31:19,460 --> 01:31:24,830
is important it is important to kind of

1647
01:31:21,980 --> 01:31:28,219
keep up with these requirements and

1648
01:31:24,830 --> 01:31:32,330
that's where our new system the violin

1649
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:34,010
system comes in this company is a

1650
01:31:32,330 --> 01:31:37,250
company that has developed all of its

1651
01:31:34,010 --> 01:31:40,250
solutions in house it is mostly software

1652
01:31:37,250 --> 01:31:44,530
however the hardware platform has been

1653
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:48,820
developed by violin flash module also

1654
01:31:44,530 --> 01:31:50,490
designed or manufactured by Toshiba

1655
01:31:48,820 --> 01:31:58,920
using the

1656
01:31:50,490 --> 01:32:01,620
violin designs $400,000,000 open

1657
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:06,260
investors been invested well the company

1658
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:16,200
has developed kind of with different

1659
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:20,750
speeds in different years and Igor has

1660
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:23,190
said that infrastructure here he is

1661
01:32:20,750 --> 01:32:25,280
infrastructure that we have here is

1662
01:32:23,190 --> 01:32:27,210
based on violin and all the companies

1663
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:29,250
organisations and businesses why they

1664
01:32:27,210 --> 01:32:36,300
think about data they're only concerned

1665
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:38,550
about two things I'm not even talking

1666
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:43,640
about responsibility we're talking about

1667
01:32:38,550 --> 01:32:51,090
speed we're talking about archiving

1668
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:54,120
tasks then we only that we're only

1669
01:32:51,090 --> 01:32:57,990
interested in the price and the amount

1670
01:32:54,120 --> 01:33:02,910
of data between the capacity you know if

1671
01:32:57,990 --> 01:33:06,000
you look like a you know net up they

1672
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:08,280
come to and asks of who our clients are

1673
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:12,750
we have a lot of clients because of

1674
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:14,670
course you don't use violin to create

1675
01:33:12,750 --> 01:33:18,000
your own infrastructure you only use it

1676
01:33:14,670 --> 01:33:20,490
for analytics for high load high

1677
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:22,170
performance databases so you only use it

1678
01:33:20,490 --> 01:33:25,710
for a certain segment of your

1679
01:33:22,170 --> 01:33:31,620
infrastructure we have Russian customers

1680
01:33:25,710 --> 01:33:34,680
we have foreign companies in the UK in

1681
01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:37,470
the United States and Turkey let me tell

1682
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:42,560
you about one case how the company got

1683
01:33:37,470 --> 01:33:42,560
to be how it came to be and

1684
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:53,200
at first the engineers that were at the

1685
01:33:49,870 --> 01:33:56,519
beginning of the company as they created

1686
01:33:53,200 --> 01:34:01,210
the fastest storage system and then they

1687
01:33:56,520 --> 01:34:05,710
decided to find who may need such a

1688
01:34:01,210 --> 01:34:10,770
system then they came to Walmart that

1689
01:34:05,710 --> 01:34:20,370
needed to calculate to the inventory

1690
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:20,370
remainders that was in 2006 6000 sk use

1691
01:34:22,890 --> 01:34:32,260
6000 stores and 15 million sk use so

1692
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:39,000
that's a huge huge amount of data and

1693
01:34:32,260 --> 01:34:44,200
entries Walmart in fact them did all the

1694
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:48,370
RNG itself it had its own R&D department

1695
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:52,870
they could solver this problem in eight

1696
01:34:48,370 --> 01:34:54,610
hours and then a violin came and told

1697
01:34:52,870 --> 01:34:56,830
them you don't need to change anything

1698
01:34:54,610 --> 01:35:00,490
you don't need to rate write the code

1699
01:34:56,830 --> 01:35:04,450
just change the storage system and they

1700
01:35:00,490 --> 01:35:05,769
were able to solve the problem in three

1701
01:35:04,450 --> 01:35:08,830
hours instead of eight hours

1702
01:35:05,770 --> 01:35:19,790
now of course the load is much larger

1703
01:35:08,830 --> 01:35:24,210
and when logisticians makers send

1704
01:35:19,790 --> 01:35:27,360
these angled trucks and of course you

1705
01:35:24,210 --> 01:35:32,010
can get these benefits in terms of

1706
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:34,349
savings of course I took time to get

1707
01:35:32,010 --> 01:35:36,840
this system up to the performance level

1708
01:35:34,350 --> 01:35:41,340
that it can deliver now so that the

1709
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:45,810
savings are significant in the range of

1710
01:35:41,340 --> 01:35:53,060
several million dollars and many

1711
01:35:45,810 --> 01:35:56,100
customers are many customers like a

1712
01:35:53,060 --> 01:36:00,420
violin and polymer / steel containers to

1713
01:35:56,100 --> 01:36:02,580
you as a violin so violin in fact is

1714
01:36:00,420 --> 01:36:06,810
major player and high performance data

1715
01:36:02,580 --> 01:36:11,190
storage systems so what do analysts say

1716
01:36:06,810 --> 01:36:16,560
the violin has cooperated for a long

1717
01:36:11,190 --> 01:36:22,080
time with I just see it is a it is a

1718
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:26,450
famous analytics provider they analyzed

1719
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:31,110
consulting servers anything and that's

1720
01:36:26,450 --> 01:36:33,360
that's a quote as you can see on the

1721
01:36:31,110 --> 01:36:39,469
slide you can see the quote of the vice

1722
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:39,469
president of ideas here Eric Bergner and

1723
01:36:41,180 --> 01:36:49,980
ITC in fact predicts that is gonna be a

1724
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:53,340
sharp increase in the performing

1725
01:36:49,980 --> 01:36:57,629
performance requirements for storage

1726
01:36:53,340 --> 01:37:02,160
systems so flash storage systems are not

1727
01:36:57,630 --> 01:37:07,770
enough there needs to be a next

1728
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:11,130
generation extreme performance extreme

1729
01:37:07,770 --> 01:37:13,960
performance or systems with a latency of

1730
01:37:11,130 --> 01:37:17,920
less than 100 microseconds

1731
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:22,719
that can handle 2.5 million operations

1732
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:27,910
per second so that's it we have a booth

1733
01:37:22,719 --> 01:37:31,770
here lever stand encourage you to visit

1734
01:37:27,910 --> 01:37:34,660
us I'd like to thank the organizers for

1735
01:37:31,770 --> 01:37:38,010
installing our equipment here and

1736
01:37:34,660 --> 01:37:41,380
testing whether it's how it can perform

1737
01:37:38,010 --> 01:37:43,540
given the load well I hope that

1738
01:37:41,380 --> 01:37:48,580
everything went without a hitch but I

1739
01:37:43,540 --> 01:37:52,330
mean of course we will request to get

1740
01:37:48,580 --> 01:37:55,120
the technical parameters and then we

1741
01:37:52,330 --> 01:37:59,710
will perhaps will perhaps feature on our

1742
01:37:55,120 --> 01:38:04,960
website how great of a jump we we did

1743
01:37:59,710 --> 01:38:06,700
that's VHD Thank You Andrey Andrey is

1744
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:10,000
will stick around if you have any

1745
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:13,260
questions you can come to his state all

1746
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:13,260
right well we're gonna change gears

1747
01:38:13,739 --> 01:38:25,330
we'll talk about internetwork screens

1748
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:28,679
which love goes deeper for Jeanette

1749
01:38:25,330 --> 01:38:35,980
systems engineer will tell us about a

1750
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:38,050
simple simple web application firewall

1751
01:38:35,980 --> 01:38:40,559
colleagues hi my name is Gustav

1752
01:38:38,050 --> 01:38:43,690
Kirchhoff I'm a systems engineer at

1753
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:46,080
fortunate today I'd like to tell you

1754
01:38:43,690 --> 01:38:46,080
about

1755
01:38:48,539 --> 01:38:55,360
the unique characteristics of a modern

1756
01:38:51,820 --> 01:38:57,518
web application firewall why they are

1757
01:38:55,360 --> 01:39:00,219
trending up or why are they so popular

1758
01:38:57,519 --> 01:39:02,409
so let's start with the basic problems

1759
01:39:00,219 --> 01:39:06,639
that are encountered

1760
01:39:02,409 --> 01:39:08,369
according to Verizon genetics and

1761
01:39:06,639 --> 01:39:11,469
positive technologies

1762
01:39:08,369 --> 01:39:15,308
virtually every third or even every

1763
01:39:11,469 --> 01:39:21,849
second application has vulnerabilities

1764
01:39:15,309 --> 01:39:29,590
that can be exploited by attackers even

1765
01:39:21,849 --> 01:39:34,179
if even if it's exploited the user may

1766
01:39:29,590 --> 01:39:37,539
not know it it can be used this exploit

1767
01:39:34,179 --> 01:39:40,869
can be used to infect a website or an

1768
01:39:37,539 --> 01:39:42,820
application for example last year a

1769
01:39:40,869 --> 01:39:45,280
group of attackers in effect to the

1770
01:39:42,820 --> 01:39:49,499
website in the United States it was a

1771
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:49,499
bank website there

1772
01:39:49,900 --> 01:40:01,000
of the transactions were made by the

1773
01:39:54,700 --> 01:40:05,250
clients of the band and the hackers just

1774
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:09,330
collected a small cut from all of those

1775
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:13,630
transactions they decided not to take a

1776
01:40:09,330 --> 01:40:17,440
one thousandth of a percentage point but

1777
01:40:13,630 --> 01:40:24,240
they decided to take one hundredth but

1778
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:26,349
then they were caught so finding those

1779
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:29,490
exploits of finding those

1780
01:40:26,350 --> 01:40:32,140
vulnerabilities may take months and

1781
01:40:29,490 --> 01:40:36,910
patching them is not so straightforward

1782
01:40:32,140 --> 01:40:42,970
it's it cannot be automated it cannot be

1783
01:40:36,910 --> 01:40:44,230
solved fast and firewall applications

1784
01:40:42,970 --> 01:40:46,990
are constantly developing and they're

1785
01:40:44,230 --> 01:40:47,860
engaging the functions that they didn't

1786
01:40:46,990 --> 01:40:51,790
have before

1787
01:40:47,860 --> 01:40:54,820
this slide shows that of several basic

1788
01:40:51,790 --> 01:41:00,190
criteria that a modern oil Web

1789
01:40:54,820 --> 01:41:03,000
Application Firewall must have okay the

1790
01:41:00,190 --> 01:41:07,450
first one is machine Lorien it's not

1791
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:11,260
it's not something that yes I think of

1792
01:41:07,450 --> 01:41:13,889
its own it exists everywhere this

1793
01:41:11,260 --> 01:41:17,710
popular in healthcare security and

1794
01:41:13,890 --> 01:41:19,780
research and so on but if you look at

1795
01:41:17,710 --> 01:41:22,840
the specific use case of a Web

1796
01:41:19,780 --> 01:41:24,849
Application Firewall you can create this

1797
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:32,070
graph let's say for example I have

1798
01:41:24,850 --> 01:41:38,850
samples that are clean if there is a

1799
01:41:32,070 --> 01:41:43,000
threshold so we can threshold these

1800
01:41:38,850 --> 01:41:47,710
samples if they are below a certain

1801
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:50,020
threshold and they are clean if they are

1802
01:41:47,710 --> 01:41:53,800
above a certain threshold then they are

1803
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:57,340
potentially anomalous that's a telltale

1804
01:41:53,800 --> 01:42:01,800
sign to the administrator to the

1805
01:41:57,340 --> 01:42:08,830
administrator that this may be a threat

1806
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:13,990
and at the second threshold the traffic

1807
01:42:08,830 --> 01:42:16,750
should be blocked so we can use all

1808
01:42:13,990 --> 01:42:20,320
sorts of parameters we can block

1809
01:42:16,750 --> 01:42:23,440
specific types of traffic post requests

1810
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:26,830
get requests and so on and so forth we

1811
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:31,870
can use very many different renders then

1812
01:42:26,830 --> 01:42:34,269
we create a model that takes all values

1813
01:42:31,870 --> 01:42:38,140
alone all of these parameters as we fit

1814
01:42:34,270 --> 01:42:42,420
into the model and then we test it what

1815
01:42:38,140 --> 01:42:42,420
does it mean instructive algorithm

1816
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:51,580
it means that this algorithm makes sure

1817
01:42:48,280 --> 01:42:54,880
that the model performs as designed as

1818
01:42:51,580 --> 01:42:59,470
intended and then we deployed to

1819
01:42:54,880 --> 01:43:04,450
production we see let's say for example

1820
01:42:59,470 --> 01:43:07,270
we have users that make legitimate

1821
01:43:04,450 --> 01:43:14,380
requests this traffic goes through and

1822
01:43:07,270 --> 01:43:17,500
then the user uses some special symbol

1823
01:43:14,380 --> 01:43:19,300
in physical request it isn't normally

1824
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:27,160
but it doesn't mean that is some

1825
01:43:19,300 --> 01:43:31,600
malicious Gordon and if a user makes a

1826
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:34,120
database request and it it is packaged

1827
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:38,050
as a get request of course this will be

1828
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:41,920
blocked as an anomalous hardware

1829
01:43:38,050 --> 01:43:43,780
acceleration that's the second most

1830
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:47,650
important thing that a web application

1831
01:43:43,780 --> 01:43:50,920
for home needs very many customers

1832
01:43:47,650 --> 01:43:53,110
complain that software that the software

1833
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:56,820
cannot handle the load all the

1834
01:43:53,110 --> 01:44:00,519
processing is done on CPU every security

1835
01:43:56,820 --> 01:44:07,660
function is implemented on CPU in order

1836
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:12,690
to offload the CPU different chips used

1837
01:44:07,660 --> 01:44:12,690
such as a six Asics are

1838
01:44:12,969 --> 01:44:22,599
kind of restricted instructions that

1839
01:44:17,099 --> 01:44:27,460
chips that perform rather fast but

1840
01:44:22,599 --> 01:44:31,380
they're cheap asacs Asics are faster

1841
01:44:27,460 --> 01:44:35,650
than fuel program monkey doing array and

1842
01:44:31,380 --> 01:44:45,210
we use with it ships in conjunction with

1843
01:44:35,650 --> 01:44:50,499
chips we use encryption ssl RSA 3G RSA

1844
01:44:45,210 --> 01:44:53,469
256 IES hundred and twenty eight and the

1845
01:44:50,499 --> 01:44:55,478
trick here is not to use the processing

1846
01:44:53,469 --> 01:45:00,239
capacity the compute capacity of your

1847
01:44:55,479 --> 01:45:04,599
CPU but on dedicated chips such as a six

1848
01:45:00,239 --> 01:45:07,860
that's how we offload as a CPUs now

1849
01:45:04,599 --> 01:45:15,940
let's look at this Kemetic of a modern

1850
01:45:07,860 --> 01:45:20,079
web application firewall we can use some

1851
01:45:15,940 --> 01:45:23,079
additional chips so we can use USB ports

1852
01:45:20,079 --> 01:45:29,259
or some other ports management ports and

1853
01:45:23,079 --> 01:45:33,849
our chips that the network interfaces

1854
01:45:29,260 --> 01:45:37,510
are the link to the network traffic will

1855
01:45:33,849 --> 01:45:42,309
be processed on the chips and then these

1856
01:45:37,510 --> 01:45:46,150
chips transfer information already

1857
01:45:42,309 --> 01:45:50,469
processed to the CPU so the CPU is not

1858
01:45:46,150 --> 01:45:55,749
overloaded and then API protection

1859
01:45:50,469 --> 01:45:58,539
that's a very relevant relevant question

1860
01:45:55,749 --> 01:46:00,728
these days because api's are extremely

1861
01:45:58,539 --> 01:46:04,329
popular these days many organizations

1862
01:46:00,729 --> 01:46:07,869
many services work based on an API there

1863
01:46:04,329 --> 01:46:11,320
are very many data exchange formats the

1864
01:46:07,869 --> 01:46:15,728
most popular of them are XML HTML and

1865
01:46:11,320 --> 01:46:17,210
JSON all the parameters of these data

1866
01:46:15,729 --> 01:46:24,950
transfer protocols

1867
01:46:17,210 --> 01:46:28,790
be screened by wvf but not all web

1868
01:46:24,950 --> 01:46:34,429
application firewalls can handle all the

1869
01:46:28,790 --> 01:46:38,450
formats of course we should check with

1870
01:46:34,430 --> 01:46:41,960
the parameters are within tolerance with

1871
01:46:38,450 --> 01:46:46,580
the DES values that are contained in

1872
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:49,160
these JSON XML and other containers we

1873
01:46:46,580 --> 01:46:56,800
can use mathematical models another

1874
01:46:49,160 --> 01:46:59,630
interesting function is the support of

1875
01:46:56,800 --> 01:47:04,940
correlation and multi protocols such as

1876
01:46:59,630 --> 01:47:08,870
HTTP HTTP web socket and FTP I've seen

1877
01:47:04,940 --> 01:47:12,440
projects where two protocols can be used

1878
01:47:08,870 --> 01:47:15,530
so they used to both WebSockets and HTTP

1879
01:47:12,440 --> 01:47:18,349
is not all web application firewalls can

1880
01:47:15,530 --> 01:47:22,190
support WebSockets if we don't support

1881
01:47:18,350 --> 01:47:28,010
the WebSockets and we have a we have a

1882
01:47:22,190 --> 01:47:31,280
gap in our security so good Web

1883
01:47:28,010 --> 01:47:33,410
Application Firewall must be able to

1884
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:37,670
handle all these different protocols

1885
01:47:33,410 --> 01:47:40,849
such as HTTP HTTP web socket and FTP

1886
01:47:37,670 --> 01:47:45,770
didn't be able to aggregate events into

1887
01:47:40,850 --> 01:47:50,860
a common incident and create row WAF

1888
01:47:45,770 --> 01:47:53,450
rules directly from the event blogger

1889
01:47:50,860 --> 01:48:00,920
integration with third-party solutions

1890
01:47:53,450 --> 01:48:05,840
modern wife waves should be able to to

1891
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:10,050
transfer files into sandbox solutions to

1892
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:15,750
be able to integrate with NGH w

1893
01:48:10,050 --> 01:48:18,480
so if you get some emails for example

1894
01:48:15,750 --> 01:48:24,150
they should be rounded to the sandbox

1895
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:28,440
check their and a clean message should

1896
01:48:24,150 --> 01:48:32,910
be forwarded to the recipient and if it

1897
01:48:28,440 --> 01:48:37,700
was an affected email then it should be

1898
01:48:32,910 --> 01:48:37,700
a quarantined

1899
01:48:39,020 --> 01:48:49,500
WAF is a collection of different

1900
01:48:43,730 --> 01:48:54,200
protection functions including IP

1901
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:57,720
reputation DDoS attack protection

1902
01:48:54,200 --> 01:49:01,380
protocol correctness checks the modern

1903
01:48:57,720 --> 01:49:06,810
trends is kind of becoming more more

1904
01:49:01,380 --> 01:49:11,340
fashionable to use these WAFS and I

1905
01:49:06,810 --> 01:49:16,650
represent other company that offers

1906
01:49:11,340 --> 01:49:18,480
these WAF WAF site development around

1907
01:49:16,650 --> 01:49:20,610
the world and in our country colleagues

1908
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:22,820
if sir any questions I'll be happy to

1909
01:49:20,610 --> 01:49:22,820
take them

1910
01:49:24,179 --> 01:49:28,629
well there are no more questions thank

1911
01:49:26,139 --> 01:49:31,959
you well I'm sure there'll be questions

1912
01:49:28,629 --> 01:49:33,550
when the customers all starts rolling it

1913
01:49:31,959 --> 01:49:38,949
out okay thank you

1914
01:49:33,550 --> 01:49:44,439
we're rolling session we have final

1915
01:49:38,949 --> 01:49:47,739
presentation it segues from well to

1916
01:49:44,439 --> 01:49:50,550
application security statistical code

1917
01:49:47,739 --> 01:49:54,339
analysis practice and theory a

1918
01:49:50,550 --> 01:49:57,519
represents over security the other stuff

1919
01:49:54,340 --> 01:50:00,099
Alexandrov will tell you how it all

1920
01:49:57,519 --> 01:50:03,820
happens in a real life and where the

1921
01:50:00,099 --> 01:50:06,360
pitfalls may be when it comes to

1922
01:50:03,820 --> 01:50:09,360
implementing these tools colleagues hi

1923
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:13,240
thanks everyone who stayed until the

1924
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:15,749
ends your few and far between but still

1925
01:50:13,240 --> 01:50:17,978
[Music]

1926
01:50:15,749 --> 01:50:20,619
this presentation was planned for a

1927
01:50:17,979 --> 01:50:30,159
longer time but I'll try to squeeze

1928
01:50:20,619 --> 01:50:31,929
within the time allowed in 2014 we've

1929
01:50:30,159 --> 01:50:35,049
been developing developing our own tool

1930
01:50:31,929 --> 01:50:38,879
since 2015 for the first two or three

1931
01:50:35,050 --> 01:50:42,989
years we've been actively building the

1932
01:50:38,879 --> 01:50:44,769
software this secure development

1933
01:50:42,989 --> 01:50:47,438
methodology with our customers when

1934
01:50:44,769 --> 01:50:51,699
talking about static analysis it's about

1935
01:50:47,439 --> 01:50:55,479
security but looking for vulnerabilities

1936
01:50:51,699 --> 01:50:58,780
without running another code it's quite

1937
01:50:55,479 --> 01:51:00,669
difficult problem which means that you

1938
01:50:58,780 --> 01:51:02,889
need to find objections for instance you

1939
01:51:00,669 --> 01:51:04,599
need to build a model simple text

1940
01:51:02,889 --> 01:51:05,919
analysis doesn't allow you to achieve

1941
01:51:04,599 --> 01:51:10,409
high quality and looking for

1942
01:51:05,919 --> 01:51:13,530
vulnerabilities and so assess tools wrap

1943
01:51:10,409 --> 01:51:17,580
sophisticated algorithm to support in

1944
01:51:13,530 --> 01:51:23,250
envelopes and embed these SAS tools into

1945
01:51:17,580 --> 01:51:26,490
development tools so a small example of

1946
01:51:23,250 --> 01:51:29,100
what makes assessed goods or what it can

1947
01:51:26,490 --> 01:51:32,429
find here we see a standard SQL

1948
01:51:29,100 --> 01:51:35,130
injection vulnerability to functions so

1949
01:51:32,430 --> 01:51:36,870
the practical user enters one function

1950
01:51:35,130 --> 01:51:40,200
and then is transferred to another

1951
01:51:36,870 --> 01:51:42,960
function through a standard string

1952
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:46,260
concatenation so a simple open source

1953
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:47,970
analyzer won't find this so it looks

1954
01:51:46,260 --> 01:51:50,600
like this sample it's a simple but you

1955
01:51:47,970 --> 01:51:53,180
understand that really sophisticated

1956
01:51:50,600 --> 01:51:56,010
injections arbitrary different modules

1957
01:51:53,180 --> 01:51:58,220
involving 10 to 15 two functions a good

1958
01:51:56,010 --> 01:52:02,580
static analyzer I should cope with that

1959
01:51:58,220 --> 01:52:04,530
so what follows from this I measure this

1960
01:52:02,580 --> 01:52:06,860
in a few minutes so when implementing a

1961
01:52:04,530 --> 01:52:10,110
number of questions arise from

1962
01:52:06,860 --> 01:52:12,330
implementation experience from our

1963
01:52:10,110 --> 01:52:14,759
communication with customers we've put

1964
01:52:12,330 --> 01:52:17,340
together a list of most frequent

1965
01:52:14,760 --> 01:52:21,120
questions and most frequently

1966
01:52:17,340 --> 01:52:23,760
encountered in errors the first question

1967
01:52:21,120 --> 01:52:26,970
that they often ask us is that we

1968
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:29,520
already have free static analysis tools

1969
01:52:26,970 --> 01:52:31,590
soniku but others that look for errors

1970
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:34,440
well would you need something else

1971
01:52:31,590 --> 01:52:37,530
especially if it costs a lot of course

1972
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:40,530
there are lots of differences between

1973
01:52:37,530 --> 01:52:45,240
different differences between free tools

1974
01:52:40,530 --> 01:52:48,090
you know and paid tools here we have

1975
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:51,570
some examples of Patos pay tolls have a

1976
01:52:48,090 --> 01:52:54,300
focus of security so they implement

1977
01:52:51,570 --> 01:52:58,170
specific algorithms to look for

1978
01:52:54,300 --> 01:53:02,250
vulnerabilities large rule basis for of

1979
01:52:58,170 --> 01:53:06,230
the search of vulnerabilities they

1980
01:53:02,250 --> 01:53:08,630
supports many programming languages they

1981
01:53:06,230 --> 01:53:11,179
and they offer support of course there

1982
01:53:08,630 --> 01:53:12,830
are free tools all tools mentioned it's

1983
01:53:11,180 --> 01:53:17,290
lighter actually quite good for their

1984
01:53:12,830 --> 01:53:20,390
purposes so we don't try to diminish the

1985
01:53:17,290 --> 01:53:22,250
values the virtues especially sonic qube

1986
01:53:20,390 --> 01:53:24,470
it's a great tool a lot of people use

1987
01:53:22,250 --> 01:53:26,930
and that gets embedded into development

1988
01:53:24,470 --> 01:53:29,780
tools quite well but there's not enough

1989
01:53:26,930 --> 01:53:32,270
there about security and the

1990
01:53:29,780 --> 01:53:33,800
vulnerability only the slight one would

1991
01:53:32,270 --> 01:53:37,040
be you would be able to find what this

1992
01:53:33,800 --> 01:53:39,890
tool there are others more focused on

1993
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:46,330
security manito fighter another one for

1994
01:53:39,890 --> 01:53:51,760
job they're more specialized but maybe

1995
01:53:46,330 --> 01:53:55,100
whose qualities should support

1996
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:58,160
development integration integration with

1997
01:53:55,100 --> 01:54:02,210
service backtrack is ID everything that

1998
01:53:58,160 --> 01:54:04,970
developers use the normal process here

1999
01:54:02,210 --> 01:54:08,390
we have a brief example of how you can

2000
01:54:04,970 --> 01:54:10,790
as schematically set up this process

2001
01:54:08,390 --> 01:54:12,110
from the acknowledged point of view so

2002
01:54:10,790 --> 01:54:15,590
there are developers using their

2003
01:54:12,110 --> 01:54:18,080
environments developers usually commit

2004
01:54:15,590 --> 01:54:21,770
code to the development repository a

2005
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:23,960
server gets other code out of the

2006
01:54:21,770 --> 01:54:28,130
repository using different triggers it

2007
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:30,560
could be some regular launches or by

2008
01:54:28,130 --> 01:54:34,070
triggers so they start testing and here

2009
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:36,020
we launch a static analysis the outcomes

2010
01:54:34,070 --> 01:54:38,299
of static analysis can be viewed by

2011
01:54:36,020 --> 01:54:41,120
developers in their own environments and

2012
01:54:38,300 --> 01:54:43,010
in the analyzer interface UI the

2013
01:54:41,120 --> 01:54:45,769
analyzer usually provides information

2014
01:54:43,010 --> 01:54:47,450
not only for the development but also to

2015
01:54:45,770 --> 01:54:51,770
a higher level analyst for security

2016
01:54:47,450 --> 01:54:55,519
officers for managers and finally quite

2017
01:54:51,770 --> 01:54:58,730
often is sat down to the security

2018
01:54:55,520 --> 01:55:02,999
officer to initiate a vulnerability back

2019
01:54:58,730 --> 01:55:05,909
tracker so that developers can fix these

2020
01:55:02,999 --> 01:55:09,898
another question that seems good okay in

2021
01:55:05,909 --> 01:55:12,299
incest pay - how to select it simple

2022
01:55:09,899 --> 01:55:14,280
things you first I need to run a

2023
01:55:12,300 --> 01:55:15,929
comparison this first thing you do there

2024
01:55:14,280 --> 01:55:18,809
are not too many tools out there in the

2025
01:55:15,929 --> 01:55:21,599
market there may be two or three three

2026
01:55:18,809 --> 01:55:24,809
or four better-known you can pilot every

2027
01:55:21,599 --> 01:55:26,849
one of the compare them against the

2028
01:55:24,809 --> 01:55:29,969
functional requirements which features

2029
01:55:26,849 --> 01:55:31,499
you need to be happy using it also you

2030
01:55:29,969 --> 01:55:34,019
have to understand that you'll be

2031
01:55:31,499 --> 01:55:37,398
embedding tools these tools into your

2032
01:55:34,019 --> 01:55:41,189
process which are specific integration

2033
01:55:37,399 --> 01:55:43,949
the schematics you use are these tools

2034
01:55:41,189 --> 01:55:46,619
integratable your devices also you need

2035
01:55:43,949 --> 01:55:49,589
to take your code for scanning I think

2036
01:55:46,619 --> 01:55:55,320
perhaps the most critical system and

2037
01:55:49,590 --> 01:55:57,119
compare the analyzes for false positives

2038
01:55:55,320 --> 01:55:59,070
for instance it's also important that

2039
01:55:57,119 --> 01:56:00,808
you need to run a specific in your case

2040
01:55:59,070 --> 01:56:02,579
you have a specific development process

2041
01:56:00,809 --> 01:56:06,979
specific integration system and specific

2042
01:56:02,579 --> 01:56:13,169
code now licensing can be quite curious

2043
01:56:06,979 --> 01:56:15,510
because some avenges limits the license

2044
01:56:13,169 --> 01:56:17,639
but number of users but now code lines

2045
01:56:15,510 --> 01:56:18,959
and this may not fit here fit your case

2046
01:56:17,639 --> 01:56:21,090
another question

2047
01:56:18,959 --> 01:56:23,309
at which point in time to run the

2048
01:56:21,090 --> 01:56:25,309
scanning so the classic answer is quite

2049
01:56:23,309 --> 01:56:28,649
simple you should run scanning as

2050
01:56:25,309 --> 01:56:31,110
frequent as possible the earlier we find

2051
01:56:28,649 --> 01:56:34,860
the vulnerability and the chip is going

2052
01:56:31,110 --> 01:56:38,058
to be to fix it static analysis say

2053
01:56:34,860 --> 01:56:41,398
improves development competence the code

2054
01:56:38,059 --> 01:56:46,439
becomes more secure as a whole and of

2055
01:56:41,399 --> 01:56:49,829
course imitation to see ICD simplifies

2056
01:56:46,439 --> 01:56:51,449
the assessed uses process so usually you

2057
01:56:49,829 --> 01:56:53,959
have to use it both in the development

2058
01:56:51,449 --> 01:56:56,820
process and also you need to run

2059
01:56:53,959 --> 01:56:58,860
pre-release checks and this is exactly

2060
01:56:56,820 --> 01:57:01,018
what we're going to talk about we have

2061
01:56:58,860 --> 01:57:03,209
quite a lot of cases but I'll talk about

2062
01:57:01,019 --> 01:57:05,889
a specific case where all the problems

2063
01:57:03,209 --> 01:57:08,769
are there I'm going to talk about having

2064
01:57:05,889 --> 01:57:11,320
we fix them and I'll explain how we fix

2065
01:57:08,770 --> 01:57:13,270
them firstly there were a lot of

2066
01:57:11,320 --> 01:57:16,030
developers and many development tools

2067
01:57:13,270 --> 01:57:18,369
many programming languages a lot of

2068
01:57:16,030 --> 01:57:19,960
codes lots of different systems and

2069
01:57:18,369 --> 01:57:22,509
everything worked differently in each

2070
01:57:19,960 --> 01:57:25,210
development team and we needed to

2071
01:57:22,510 --> 01:57:28,179
implement deploy sassed into this

2072
01:57:25,210 --> 01:57:30,010
company questions that's right we

2073
01:57:28,179 --> 01:57:32,080
understood that paid tools they need to

2074
01:57:30,010 --> 01:57:34,030
be used we roughly the same way to run

2075
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:35,679
them so the question is how was the

2076
01:57:34,030 --> 01:57:38,590
complexity and let's just connect it

2077
01:57:35,679 --> 01:57:40,869
just like any other verification and

2078
01:57:38,590 --> 01:57:42,520
checks will be running it from time to

2079
01:57:40,869 --> 01:57:43,980
time we shouldn't be having problems it

2080
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:46,889
turns out that there are problems

2081
01:57:43,980 --> 01:57:49,509
because the search for sophisticated

2082
01:57:46,889 --> 01:57:52,869
vulnerability takes a lot of time a lot

2083
01:57:49,510 --> 01:57:54,520
of resources and how you are not able to

2084
01:57:52,869 --> 01:57:56,710
run it just like you're not simple

2085
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:59,350
checks it takes a lot of work and then

2086
01:57:56,710 --> 01:58:04,810
the question comes up of how to set up

2087
01:57:59,350 --> 01:58:06,820
her the usual dev shakeups a process so

2088
01:58:04,810 --> 01:58:08,530
usually when we start talking to the

2089
01:58:06,820 --> 01:58:11,559
developers there's an expectation that

2090
01:58:08,530 --> 01:58:14,469
would work fast so you can run it

2091
01:58:11,560 --> 01:58:16,570
forever commit may be to understand who

2092
01:58:14,469 --> 01:58:19,659
and when introduced the vulnerability

2093
01:58:16,570 --> 01:58:21,730
but it goes against the reality and

2094
01:58:19,659 --> 01:58:24,190
explains why it can take quite a lot of

2095
01:58:21,730 --> 01:58:27,129
time to run you don't normally have

2096
01:58:24,190 --> 01:58:30,280
resources to run it after every commit

2097
01:58:27,130 --> 01:58:32,139
it's very it's a difficult attribute the

2098
01:58:30,280 --> 01:58:33,790
authorship to a specific user because

2099
01:58:32,139 --> 01:58:35,679
there are different features different

2100
01:58:33,790 --> 01:58:37,510
functions that are shared between

2101
01:58:35,679 --> 01:58:39,610
different modules a change of

2102
01:58:37,510 --> 01:58:41,170
vulnerability will introduce changes in

2103
01:58:39,610 --> 01:58:44,230
other places and also there are false

2104
01:58:41,170 --> 01:58:46,810
positives in and it's not quite clear

2105
01:58:44,230 --> 01:58:48,519
how to set up quality gates how the

2106
01:58:46,810 --> 01:58:51,369
results of static analysis will affect

2107
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:54,610
the builds of the release and so on and

2108
01:58:51,369 --> 01:58:58,089
so forth if you want aesthetic so the

2109
01:58:54,610 --> 01:59:00,940
sense is like this for instance a we

2110
01:58:58,090 --> 01:59:03,010
have quite a large piece of code for two

2111
01:59:00,940 --> 01:59:04,599
million lines it takes six or seven

2112
01:59:03,010 --> 01:59:08,739
hours to analyze

2113
01:59:04,600 --> 01:59:11,110
they said you can see that the 20,000

2114
01:59:08,739 --> 01:59:13,509
line code can be analysed in 40 minutes

2115
01:59:11,110 --> 01:59:14,469
and other projects twice as large in

2116
01:59:13,510 --> 01:59:16,039
seven minutes

2117
01:59:14,469 --> 01:59:18,019
so the reason

2118
01:59:16,039 --> 01:59:20,059
is that the time of scanning by

2119
01:59:18,019 --> 01:59:22,880
statistic a static analyzer depends not

2120
01:59:20,059 --> 01:59:24,500
only on the code and language it depends

2121
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:26,300
on a lot of other attributes of a

2122
01:59:24,500 --> 01:59:29,059
specific problem the complexity of

2123
01:59:26,300 --> 01:59:30,980
structures the modularity and so on so

2124
01:59:29,059 --> 01:59:34,219
forth so it's important to understand

2125
01:59:30,980 --> 01:59:36,259
how much time the scanning of your

2126
01:59:34,219 --> 01:59:38,150
particular code will take and how much

2127
01:59:36,260 --> 01:59:39,590
resources will be consumed when they

2128
01:59:38,150 --> 01:59:41,659
sterilize if you understand how

2129
01:59:39,590 --> 01:59:43,039
frequently went around scanning how much

2130
01:59:41,659 --> 01:59:44,780
time is going to take you understand how

2131
01:59:43,039 --> 01:59:48,079
much resources you need and it's

2132
01:59:44,780 --> 01:59:51,139
important to define the triggers by

2133
01:59:48,079 --> 01:59:53,630
which the scanning will be lost so that

2134
01:59:51,139 --> 01:59:56,389
on the one hand the use of this tool

2135
01:59:53,630 --> 01:59:59,599
should be comfortable for developers and

2136
01:59:56,389 --> 02:00:02,090
they should get results and work and

2137
01:59:59,599 --> 02:00:04,340
also they shouldn't consume too much

2138
02:00:02,090 --> 02:00:05,210
resource and too much time to mean

2139
02:00:04,340 --> 02:00:07,010
yourself too much time

2140
02:00:05,210 --> 02:00:09,349
the resources are will have to be

2141
02:00:07,010 --> 02:00:12,320
factored in because it's an analyzer it

2142
02:00:09,349 --> 02:00:13,670
has a new process in the system and

2143
02:00:12,320 --> 02:00:16,039
finally sometimes you can use

2144
02:00:13,670 --> 02:00:18,590
incremental analysis and process and

2145
02:00:16,039 --> 02:00:20,869
that allows analyzing only the cheat

2146
02:00:18,590 --> 02:00:23,090
code have to be cut Karen will do this

2147
02:00:20,869 --> 02:00:26,268
because in all analyzers at least

2148
02:00:23,090 --> 02:00:28,670
missing vulnerabilities you can't run a

2149
02:00:26,269 --> 02:00:30,230
fully fledged analysis because what will

2150
02:00:28,670 --> 02:00:32,929
disappear at the interface between they

2151
02:00:30,230 --> 02:00:34,848
feel different components so a lot of

2152
02:00:32,929 --> 02:00:39,500
critical vulnerabilities may be lost

2153
02:00:34,849 --> 02:00:42,010
there so basically the case that I

2154
02:00:39,500 --> 02:00:45,710
mentioned there was an interesting

2155
02:00:42,010 --> 02:00:49,489
situation how we found the compromise

2156
02:00:45,710 --> 02:00:52,250
between the time required for doing the

2157
02:00:49,489 --> 02:00:55,610
scan on large amount of codes and the

2158
02:00:52,250 --> 02:00:57,170
desire of the result so briefly talking

2159
02:00:55,610 --> 02:00:59,750
to the developers who understood that

2160
02:00:57,170 --> 02:01:02,750
the adequate number of scanning runs

2161
02:00:59,750 --> 02:01:06,440
would be if for a specific development

2162
02:01:02,750 --> 02:01:11,809
feature branch the scanning would be

2163
02:01:06,440 --> 02:01:14,210
started from when passing from status in

2164
02:01:11,809 --> 02:01:17,480
development to interview so it turned

2165
02:01:14,210 --> 02:01:20,210
out that such transfers were only done a

2166
02:01:17,480 --> 02:01:21,829
few times a day and it fitted the

2167
02:01:20,210 --> 02:01:25,370
process and the amount of resource

2168
02:01:21,829 --> 02:01:27,679
available with this approach so the

2169
02:01:25,370 --> 02:01:30,470
finishes the work on the task then

2170
02:01:27,680 --> 02:01:32,210
transfers it to review automatically the

2171
02:01:30,470 --> 02:01:33,860
scanner gets the most requests and get

2172
02:01:32,210 --> 02:01:36,050
love they see comments to their code

2173
02:01:33,860 --> 02:01:38,240
from static analysis in the environment

2174
02:01:36,050 --> 02:01:42,380
where they ran the merge request so that

2175
02:01:38,240 --> 02:01:44,690
one had we see the scanning runs in the

2176
02:01:42,380 --> 02:01:46,460
process in the run process then the

2177
02:01:44,690 --> 02:01:50,030
other hand developers don't need does

2178
02:01:46,460 --> 02:01:53,150
need to go to the sass to test to so

2179
02:01:50,030 --> 02:01:55,639
this is a real integration developers

2180
02:01:53,150 --> 02:01:59,990
could also run a scanning manually and

2181
02:01:55,640 --> 02:02:04,690
the results that they were adding to my

2182
02:01:59,990 --> 02:02:07,969
requests were filtered by severity by

2183
02:02:04,690 --> 02:02:11,540
the vulnerability being old and you saw

2184
02:02:07,970 --> 02:02:14,840
that the number of such complaints

2185
02:02:11,540 --> 02:02:17,650
should be adequate to be fixed in time

2186
02:02:14,840 --> 02:02:20,480
sometimes you fail to find such a

2187
02:02:17,650 --> 02:02:22,040
compromise such as right off so the

2188
02:02:20,480 --> 02:02:23,959
classic approach is direct scanning

2189
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:25,490
every night so that next morning

2190
02:02:23,960 --> 02:02:27,260
developers could see what the

2191
02:02:25,490 --> 02:02:31,849
vulnerability says they added in the

2192
02:02:27,260 --> 02:02:33,380
previous day the next point okay we're

2193
02:02:31,850 --> 02:02:36,710
gonna search how to run the scanning how

2194
02:02:33,380 --> 02:02:40,640
to integrate we've understood that we

2195
02:02:36,710 --> 02:02:42,980
need to find a trade-off and still we

2196
02:02:40,640 --> 02:02:45,530
run a scanning and see a lot of

2197
02:02:42,980 --> 02:02:47,780
positives there may be tens of thousands

2198
02:02:45,530 --> 02:02:49,639
of them and you have feeling there are

2199
02:02:47,780 --> 02:02:52,309
too many false positives so the question

2200
02:02:49,640 --> 02:02:56,210
is what to do with them so in practical

2201
02:02:52,310 --> 02:02:59,030
terms practical advice first you have

2202
02:02:56,210 --> 02:03:03,230
filters any static analyzers allows your

2203
02:02:59,030 --> 02:03:08,780
filtering out filtering the code by

2204
02:03:03,230 --> 02:03:11,419
directory by files by packet package

2205
02:03:08,780 --> 02:03:16,429
a library in some some analyzers have

2206
02:03:11,420 --> 02:03:20,210
inbuilt Library exclusion tools and also

2207
02:03:16,429 --> 02:03:24,739
you can process the results based on

2208
02:03:20,210 --> 02:03:27,469
severity and there's another parameter

2209
02:03:24,739 --> 02:03:32,030
in addition to severity for instance

2210
02:03:27,469 --> 02:03:34,940
there's confidence it makes sense to

2211
02:03:32,030 --> 02:03:37,040
start with those vulnerabilities a

2212
02:03:34,940 --> 02:03:41,809
weather analyzer in which they own

2213
02:03:37,040 --> 02:03:44,320
analyzer is the most confident that

2214
02:03:41,810 --> 02:03:47,900
another false passports fear you should

2215
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:51,400
exercise caution employing filtering

2216
02:03:47,900 --> 02:03:54,469
because it may lead to losing

2217
02:03:51,400 --> 02:03:57,110
vulnerability the results the good

2218
02:03:54,469 --> 02:04:02,230
analyzes allow marking the results are

2219
02:03:57,110 --> 02:04:04,670
also good analyzers have a tracking

2220
02:04:02,230 --> 02:04:07,099
function even in large projects you can

2221
02:04:04,670 --> 02:04:10,120
do this certificate once and then you'll

2222
02:04:07,100 --> 02:04:12,860
be verifying only new vulnerabilities

2223
02:04:10,120 --> 02:04:15,050
even after the filtering there are still

2224
02:04:12,860 --> 02:04:17,269
a lot of vulnerabilities left that you

2225
02:04:15,050 --> 02:04:19,100
need to process the most important

2226
02:04:17,270 --> 02:04:22,300
recommendations to all our colleagues

2227
02:04:19,100 --> 02:04:24,380
give is to start with not long new

2228
02:04:22,300 --> 02:04:28,070
vulnerabilities to happen so to set the

2229
02:04:24,380 --> 02:04:29,810
process up in such a way that if you are

2230
02:04:28,070 --> 02:04:32,480
only looking at the new vulnerabilities

2231
02:04:29,810 --> 02:04:35,660
that have appeared in the past day a

2232
02:04:32,480 --> 02:04:38,000
week that the number of them should be

2233
02:04:35,660 --> 02:04:41,150
not too large to be fixed at the time

2234
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:45,699
also you can fix vulnerabilities in the

2235
02:04:41,150 --> 02:04:48,379
first scanning in the previous scannings

2236
02:04:45,699 --> 02:04:50,960
gradually by using the filters princess

2237
02:04:48,380 --> 02:04:52,850
histogram for specific a project so we

2238
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:55,429
had five vulnerabilities appearing every

2239
02:04:52,850 --> 02:04:57,320
day and they were fixed in time all the

2240
02:04:55,429 --> 02:05:01,580
vulnerabilities that were found in the

2241
02:04:57,320 --> 02:05:03,980
first run of the scanner were fixed over

2242
02:05:01,580 --> 02:05:07,340
over a five month period by five

2243
02:05:03,980 --> 02:05:09,468
developers and the last point if all

2244
02:05:07,340 --> 02:05:13,460
these questions around since everything

2245
02:05:09,469 --> 02:05:15,410
seems to be clear for you we run the

2246
02:05:13,460 --> 02:05:18,489
scanning work with results and still a

2247
02:05:15,410 --> 02:05:20,929
lot of people talking about building the

2248
02:05:18,489 --> 02:05:21,400
secure software development process so

2249
02:05:20,929 --> 02:05:23,440
what

2250
02:05:21,400 --> 02:05:24,820
well there are some prerequisites which

2251
02:05:23,440 --> 02:05:27,129
are quite obvious and I'll talk about

2252
02:05:24,820 --> 02:05:30,250
technical features of static analysis

2253
02:05:27,130 --> 02:05:32,469
that many people are not exposed to even

2254
02:05:30,250 --> 02:05:34,000
develop as because runs a lot consumers

2255
02:05:32,469 --> 02:05:36,760
not the resources but you need it

2256
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:38,679
because it can find sophisticated

2257
02:05:36,760 --> 02:05:40,449
vulnerabilities and based on this and

2258
02:05:38,679 --> 02:05:43,960
not everybody else how to use it how to

2259
02:05:40,449 --> 02:05:47,440
work and this turns from a technical

2260
02:05:43,960 --> 02:05:49,750
aspect into a national aspect how

2261
02:05:47,440 --> 02:05:53,019
historically a development security have

2262
02:05:49,750 --> 02:05:55,380
been separated vulnerability is not a

2263
02:05:53,020 --> 02:05:58,390
features not a bug so in classical

2264
02:05:55,380 --> 02:05:59,920
approach it's not the responsibility of

2265
02:05:58,390 --> 02:06:01,420
the developers the responsible

2266
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:03,670
responsibilities of security people it's

2267
02:06:01,420 --> 02:06:05,679
not quite so clear to all developers

2268
02:06:03,670 --> 02:06:07,659
that they need to do that coming back to

2269
02:06:05,679 --> 02:06:10,570
the case many teams many systems and

2270
02:06:07,659 --> 02:06:13,330
then you get the new objects static

2271
02:06:10,570 --> 02:06:15,759
analysis from abilities to handle which

2272
02:06:13,330 --> 02:06:17,769
they hadn't need to address in the past

2273
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:20,110
some what kind of problems we got them

2274
02:06:17,770 --> 02:06:23,679
and how we solve them firstly about the

2275
02:06:20,110 --> 02:06:26,769
implementation time when we were

2276
02:06:23,679 --> 02:06:30,790
discussing the problem with customers

2277
02:06:26,770 --> 02:06:32,469
business unit we wanted to introduce us

2278
02:06:30,790 --> 02:06:34,600
at the same time and it went bang with

2279
02:06:32,469 --> 02:06:36,610
our teams and remove all vulnerable T as

2280
02:06:34,600 --> 02:06:38,020
fast as poss as soon as possible based

2281
02:06:36,610 --> 02:06:41,349
on previous experience for I understand

2282
02:06:38,020 --> 02:06:45,969
that it normally ends in bad results

2283
02:06:41,350 --> 02:06:47,170
because well firstly releases start

2284
02:06:45,969 --> 02:06:50,770
getting blocked and there are many

2285
02:06:47,170 --> 02:06:52,750
releases you're not keeping up fixing

2286
02:06:50,770 --> 02:06:54,760
them developers don't know why it is

2287
02:06:52,750 --> 02:06:56,140
needed this functionality is running

2288
02:06:54,760 --> 02:06:58,870
there are bugs that seem to be more

2289
02:06:56,140 --> 02:07:00,820
important so they remove our ability to

2290
02:06:58,870 --> 02:07:02,980
take two months the release gets stopped

2291
02:07:00,820 --> 02:07:06,400
and there are real cases where business

2292
02:07:02,980 --> 02:07:08,820
just stops the implementation of

2293
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:11,230
ourselves because of this behavior so

2294
02:07:08,820 --> 02:07:13,269
therefore it's important to implement

2295
02:07:11,230 --> 02:07:15,459
science especially in large company in a

2296
02:07:13,270 --> 02:07:17,949
gradual way it makes sense to stuff with

2297
02:07:15,460 --> 02:07:20,590
two or three critical system web

2298
02:07:17,949 --> 02:07:21,370
applications mobile applications so the

2299
02:07:20,590 --> 02:07:24,370
self-assess

2300
02:07:21,370 --> 02:07:26,260
adds to the security of this system and

2301
02:07:24,370 --> 02:07:28,150
then start expiring this code it's also

2302
02:07:26,260 --> 02:07:29,410
important to start without blocking the

2303
02:07:28,150 --> 02:07:32,259
release

2304
02:07:29,410 --> 02:07:36,370
to the trial round of the process to

2305
02:07:32,260 --> 02:07:37,660
train all the participants on assess to

2306
02:07:36,370 --> 02:07:39,309
let them understand that it's not

2307
02:07:37,660 --> 02:07:42,730
something to fear there is really an

2308
02:07:39,310 --> 02:07:45,040
important thing now and gradually in

2309
02:07:42,730 --> 02:07:48,429
half a year here you could start using

2310
02:07:45,040 --> 02:07:52,720
it in the real release process you have

2311
02:07:48,430 --> 02:07:55,030
to start with removing new newly found

2312
02:07:52,720 --> 02:07:57,520
real nura bilities and then gradually

2313
02:07:55,030 --> 02:07:59,500
remove the old ones also for the large

2314
02:07:57,520 --> 02:08:02,740
companies it's important to regulate the

2315
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:05,740
process to prepare the rules and

2316
02:08:02,740 --> 02:08:08,860
policies and get them approved by

2317
02:08:05,740 --> 02:08:11,950
participants in our case the

2318
02:08:08,860 --> 02:08:14,110
implementation has taken almost a year

2319
02:08:11,950 --> 02:08:18,670
it's now almost finished I talked about

2320
02:08:14,110 --> 02:08:22,950
regulations and ampere what can be

2321
02:08:18,670 --> 02:08:26,290
included in the secure development

2322
02:08:22,950 --> 02:08:28,780
process there should be certain steps

2323
02:08:26,290 --> 02:08:30,820
are made from identifying the well

2324
02:08:28,780 --> 02:08:34,990
detecting a vulnerability to fixing it

2325
02:08:30,820 --> 02:08:37,509
so our responsibilities should be

2326
02:08:34,990 --> 02:08:39,790
attributed who's responsible for who

2327
02:08:37,510 --> 02:08:41,400
owns the results how communication is

2328
02:08:39,790 --> 02:08:43,570
built between different departments

2329
02:08:41,400 --> 02:08:47,019
especially between development and

2330
02:08:43,570 --> 02:08:49,450
security who verifies the vulnerability

2331
02:08:47,020 --> 02:08:51,280
who confirms that this vulnerability are

2332
02:08:49,450 --> 02:08:54,460
not alone rebuilding how do you escalate

2333
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:56,320
when security and developers can't

2334
02:08:54,460 --> 02:08:58,660
arrive at the same conclusion there

2335
02:08:56,320 --> 02:09:00,219
should be a slate not even to fix the

2336
02:08:58,660 --> 02:09:02,740
vulnerability because some

2337
02:09:00,220 --> 02:09:04,600
vulnerabilities take maybe six months

2338
02:09:02,740 --> 02:09:06,969
because you'll have to write their

2339
02:09:04,600 --> 02:09:10,990
kotecha but there should be responses

2340
02:09:06,970 --> 02:09:12,850
away so security found if owner ability

2341
02:09:10,990 --> 02:09:16,389
send them to development and development

2342
02:09:12,850 --> 02:09:18,850
should reply should respond within a

2343
02:09:16,390 --> 02:09:20,500
specified time if it is a vulnerability

2344
02:09:18,850 --> 02:09:22,960
and how much it'll cost to fix it and

2345
02:09:20,500 --> 02:09:26,680
also what's important to mention in the

2346
02:09:22,960 --> 02:09:30,790
regulation is how new systems would be

2347
02:09:26,680 --> 02:09:32,770
added to the process you need to be to

2348
02:09:30,790 --> 02:09:35,560
know who's responsible for the addition

2349
02:09:32,770 --> 02:09:37,840
which information needs to be added to

2350
02:09:35,560 --> 02:09:40,340
keep for the software development

2351
02:09:37,840 --> 02:09:43,540
process safe and secure also

2352
02:09:40,340 --> 02:09:46,910
understand that secure development

2353
02:09:43,540 --> 02:09:49,310
regulations should also be much where

2354
02:09:46,910 --> 02:09:53,360
other regulations private policies

2355
02:09:49,310 --> 02:09:55,250
practices activities you have to

2356
02:09:53,360 --> 02:09:57,290
understand what other policies and

2357
02:09:55,250 --> 02:10:00,680
regulations exist the company which

2358
02:09:57,290 --> 02:10:03,790
apply to development and how they

2359
02:10:00,680 --> 02:10:06,950
interoperate sometimes you need to apply

2360
02:10:03,790 --> 02:10:09,610
secure software development say in the

2361
02:10:06,950 --> 02:10:12,980
situation where you don't have a

2362
02:10:09,610 --> 02:10:17,059
development environment regulated in

2363
02:10:12,980 --> 02:10:19,070
total the approval process can take a

2364
02:10:17,060 --> 02:10:23,630
long time so specifically in this case

2365
02:10:19,070 --> 02:10:26,000
that I'm describing the implementation

2366
02:10:23,630 --> 02:10:27,890
has taken a year and the regulations are

2367
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:29,480
not yet fully approved a lot of

2368
02:10:27,890 --> 02:10:31,040
participant in the process everyone has

2369
02:10:29,480 --> 02:10:33,139
their own point of view how it should

2370
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:37,880
work and ideally well actually the real

2371
02:10:33,140 --> 02:10:40,310
life you have to take a cus certain

2372
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:42,470
things and discard others but in real

2373
02:10:40,310 --> 02:10:44,630
life you have to understand who approves

2374
02:10:42,470 --> 02:10:47,930
which document in their final form also

2375
02:10:44,630 --> 02:10:49,880
what we encounter quite often and

2376
02:10:47,930 --> 02:10:57,910
specifically in this case it applied as

2377
02:10:49,880 --> 02:10:57,910
well no resources so so quite often the

2378
02:10:59,170 --> 02:11:05,840
responsibilities are for identifying the

2379
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:08,900
vulnerability is not part of a developer

2380
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:12,430
job description so the one hand you need

2381
02:11:08,900 --> 02:11:15,230
to allocate budget for new resources

2382
02:11:12,430 --> 02:11:19,400
then you should regulate the ownership

2383
02:11:15,230 --> 02:11:22,429
and finally vulnerabilities should be

2384
02:11:19,400 --> 02:11:27,070
fixed in the same way as bugs are in

2385
02:11:22,430 --> 02:11:30,500
each release in the process of

2386
02:11:27,070 --> 02:11:32,150
negotiation approval and interaction

2387
02:11:30,500 --> 02:11:34,940
with developers so that everybody should

2388
02:11:32,150 --> 02:11:37,790
understand why SAS and what's it needed

2389
02:11:34,940 --> 02:11:41,339
for it's important to make sure that all

2390
02:11:37,790 --> 02:11:43,920
people should understand and

2391
02:11:41,340 --> 02:11:47,010
why and how important is there are

2392
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:49,290
certain things a vulnerability affixed

2393
02:11:47,010 --> 02:11:51,780
at the development time is many orders

2394
02:11:49,290 --> 02:11:53,760
of magnitude cheaper than a

2395
02:11:51,780 --> 02:11:56,160
vulnerability found in production it's

2396
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:57,870
important to find real vulnerabilities

2397
02:11:56,160 --> 02:12:04,080
in your code to show how they exploited

2398
02:11:57,870 --> 02:12:07,170
to show what a real outcomes or impact

2399
02:12:04,080 --> 02:12:09,059
is can make quite often developers are

2400
02:12:07,170 --> 02:12:11,520
interested in getting in getting new

2401
02:12:09,060 --> 02:12:15,570
information improved for their professed

2402
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:22,200
level and assessed does allow improving

2403
02:12:15,570 --> 02:12:26,009
the skills in application security we

2404
02:12:22,200 --> 02:12:31,550
get these stages in implementing assess

2405
02:12:26,010 --> 02:12:34,670
choosing the to process definition

2406
02:12:31,550 --> 02:12:37,530
technical solutions definition

2407
02:12:34,670 --> 02:12:41,580
implementation and trial run all these

2408
02:12:37,530 --> 02:12:43,349
steps run iteratively on the same time

2409
02:12:41,580 --> 02:12:47,760
but with the gradual expansion of the

2410
02:12:43,350 --> 02:12:51,150
scope team by team system by system so

2411
02:12:47,760 --> 02:12:53,370
what are the outcomes for our specific

2412
02:12:51,150 --> 02:12:54,990
analyzer and for our specific customers

2413
02:12:53,370 --> 02:12:57,599
and we have about 100 successful

2414
02:12:54,990 --> 02:13:03,480
implementations almost all users

2415
02:12:57,600 --> 02:13:07,320
continue using the tool and now the

2416
02:13:03,480 --> 02:13:09,480
trend is as such that customer society

2417
02:13:07,320 --> 02:13:12,410
with many oldest and this was most of

2418
02:13:09,480 --> 02:13:14,759
those customers start to migrate to

2419
02:13:12,410 --> 02:13:16,950
secure development process to

2420
02:13:14,760 --> 02:13:18,690
integration to implement into

2421
02:13:16,950 --> 02:13:20,550
implementing assess in the development

2422
02:13:18,690 --> 02:13:23,490
process the numbers are here we now have

2423
02:13:20,550 --> 02:13:25,020
more than 30 customers gradually

2424
02:13:23,490 --> 02:13:28,019
migrating to integration and more than

2425
02:13:25,020 --> 02:13:31,200
and about 10 have already built the

2426
02:13:28,020 --> 02:13:33,990
process and implemented it so the main

2427
02:13:31,200 --> 02:13:36,480
conclusions that we can make something

2428
02:13:33,990 --> 02:13:38,760
you need it indeed is a useful tool to

2429
02:13:36,480 --> 02:13:40,860
find sophisticated vulnerabilities must

2430
02:13:38,760 --> 02:13:43,690
be used it's important to use every

2431
02:13:40,860 --> 02:13:47,269
phase the development adapting the

2432
02:13:43,690 --> 02:13:50,000
process to your specific code and your

2433
02:13:47,270 --> 02:13:52,940
development process you need to work

2434
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:56,570
with scanning settings with the results

2435
02:13:52,940 --> 02:13:58,940
were verifying them editing them you

2436
02:13:56,570 --> 02:14:01,219
need to start with fixing newly found

2437
02:13:58,940 --> 02:14:04,400
vulnerabilities and then gradually

2438
02:14:01,220 --> 02:14:07,040
remove the older ones that were found in

2439
02:14:04,400 --> 02:14:09,379
the first scan scanning you and need to

2440
02:14:07,040 --> 02:14:11,330
create a process based on cest because

2441
02:14:09,380 --> 02:14:14,150
especially in large company they use

2442
02:14:11,330 --> 02:14:16,489
will attenuates and customers will go

2443
02:14:14,150 --> 02:14:18,379
away give up on using this tool because

2444
02:14:16,489 --> 02:14:21,139
they haven't been able to implement the

2445
02:14:18,380 --> 02:14:23,170
process and finally as a process it

2446
02:14:21,140 --> 02:14:28,060
needs to be implemented gradually

2447
02:14:23,170 --> 02:14:32,090
gradually expanding the scope thank you

2448
02:14:28,060 --> 02:14:35,239
thank you your Aslam so we've finished

2449
02:14:32,090 --> 02:14:38,480
our session finally it was a it was long

2450
02:14:35,239 --> 02:14:42,290
it covered a lot of technologies any

2451
02:14:38,480 --> 02:14:46,129
questions we can discuss or we can

2452
02:14:42,290 --> 02:14:49,310
adjust to talk it's a microphone and if

2453
02:14:46,130 --> 02:14:51,110
there's nothing we can actually go

2454
02:14:49,310 --> 02:14:53,420
outside because somebody shout three two

2455
02:14:51,110 --> 02:14:55,489
one and everybody shouted and I got

2456
02:14:53,420 --> 02:14:57,560
because they interested what was

2457
02:14:55,489 --> 02:14:59,629
happening so if there are no questions

2458
02:14:57,560 --> 02:15:01,580
to speakers let them go continue their

2459
02:14:59,630 --> 02:15:03,050
work because the work day is not over so

2460
02:15:01,580 --> 02:15:05,269
they can continue thank you for your

2461
02:15:03,050 --> 02:15:07,310
attention thank you for being with us I

2462
02:15:05,270 --> 02:15:10,030
have a good day and come back again

2463
02:15:07,310 --> 02:15:10,030
thank you
