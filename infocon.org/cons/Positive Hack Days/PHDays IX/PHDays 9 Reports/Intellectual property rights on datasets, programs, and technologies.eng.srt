1
00:00:01,129 --> 00:00:08,069
servant the conference has been run for

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:12,300
ninth for the ninth year pH day and the

3
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:14,820
first time you have to hear lawyers

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,369
so therefore the right question or what

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:22,500
should you expect of lawyers why should

6
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:24,060
you need them as software developers so

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,000
we're talking about the transformation

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:31,080
of law and the role of lawyers in this

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,840
process we'll talk about the protection

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:40,860
of Technology of intellectual property

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:44,879
rights we'll talk about tools to protect

12
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:48,809
these technologies and also talked about

13
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,940
the assessments of the outcomes of

14
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,669
intellectual activities because it's

15
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:57,629
quite an important subject my name is

16
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:59,489
Robert Iger for the past 20 years I've

17
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:02,968
been working with lawyers I'm not a

18
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:04,619
lawyer myself but I work with lawyers a

19
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,959
lot and for the past three or four years

20
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:11,729
I've been dealing with the questions of

21
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:15,240
applying technologies in legal work our

22
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:18,049
some people call legal tech joining me

23
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:22,079
in this session I have viktor petrov

24
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:25,679
general director at civic is and he'll

25
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:28,678
be talking about the journey of a

26
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:31,169
development so why lawyers are needed in

27
00:01:28,679 --> 00:01:34,169
IT the main question of today next here

28
00:01:31,169 --> 00:01:36,869
we have yoga shakirov he's an expert in

29
00:01:34,169 --> 00:01:39,810
machine learning and big data at

30
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:42,299
technoServe and he'll talk about date

31
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:46,729
protection and the machine learning

32
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:51,299
model as a digital asset of a company

33
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:54,090
next to him we have Italia Shogun patent

34
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:57,539
attorney in pattern family group Vitali

35
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:02,789
will talk about internet intelligence

36
00:01:57,539 --> 00:02:04,679
for property and info SEC threats and

37
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:07,439
last but not least we have Galindo Greco

38
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:09,869
she is a founder of the corporate

39
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,650
management system Eric and she will talk

40
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:15,190
about the automation of

41
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:17,709
digital asset management in a software

42
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:23,049
development development company so let's

43
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:26,680
start with a few words from myself about

44
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:30,209
the role of lawyers I think here among

45
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:33,579
you there are no lawyers and galena will

46
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:40,049
excuse me for the comparison but frankly

47
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:43,660
most non lawyers have quite a bad

48
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:48,569
attitude was lawyers they only come to

49
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:50,549
them when the bad thing has already

50
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:54,390
happened

51
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:57,310
yes sense of communicating with them

52
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:59,379
during the process of development we

53
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:03,700
came here to discuss the intellectual

54
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:05,950
property issues the fourth section of a

55
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,470
civil code has been in effect in this

56
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:10,690
country for more than 10 years covering

57
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:12,400
all questions regarding the intellectual

58
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:15,250
property protection but business in this

59
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:19,180
country and said it does not only apply

60
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:22,630
to Russia gets used very slowly to the

61
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:30,310
idea that intellectual property has some

62
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:35,790
value has some cost why is it so because

63
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:41,500
all of us have got used to the idea of

64
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:44,048
assessing tangible things in Russia you

65
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:48,099
can spit in any direction and you will

66
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:52,239
surely your spittle will find a way to

67
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:55,328
some security person you know where

68
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,220
houses and offices are protected is the

69
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:59,590
most valuable asset but what's most

70
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,319
important intellectual property we just

71
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:04,359
can't see it we can't evaluate it it's

72
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:08,379
very difficult to assess what you can't

73
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:13,269
see but in order to them to understand

74
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:16,940
why we are talking about the protection

75
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:20,470
of intellectual property why

76
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:24,940
it should be protected in the proper way

77
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:28,400
we need to come back to some statistic

78
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:31,630
the United States so where intellectual

79
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,719
property is best protected and

80
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:43,090
formalized it's a it's a huge business

81
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:47,870
in fact there but companies that work

82
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:49,219
mostly in the area of using IP in the

83
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:54,320
United States the share of such

84
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:56,960
companies is one-third of the GDP

85
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:02,840
seventy five percent of the exports and

86
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:07,840
the total worth of non material assets

87
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:17,109
include an IEP and United States is just

88
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:20,659
shy of six trillion dollars in order to

89
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:22,730
understand how much that is and by the

90
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:26,890
way this is data of the United States

91
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:29,300
but this is more or less than 80 percent

92
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:32,000
Indiana State thirty percent of the

93
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:35,300
assets and third percent of the value of

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:45,280
companies yes intellectual property is

95
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:48,610
not not manufacturing machines and of

96
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,609
material assets

97
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:57,780
thirty percent all approximately thirty

98
00:05:54,510 --> 00:06:03,780
percent of the GDP nine percent of the

99
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:09,809
exports and companyís at that primarily

100
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:13,700
use intellectual property they provide

101
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:18,570
twenty six percent of the jobs they

102
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:24,599
these companies in fact make a huge

103
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:26,430
share of the total economy and which the

104
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:32,280
People's Republic of China has made a

105
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:36,620
huge step even a leap forward over the

106
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:43,859
past twenty years used to copy things

107
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:50,400
now they are among the leaders of in

108
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:55,520
terms of patent number of patents the

109
00:06:50,400 --> 00:07:00,030
number of patent applications for

110
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:08,900
patents has grown five times over the

111
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:12,140
past few years every year 2.1 million

112
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,140
patents are filed

113
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:23,639
since 1990 the number of patents

114
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:36,410
approved the number number of patents

115
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:45,720
given has doubled since 1990 and this

116
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:50,760
data better reflects the situation if

117
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:56,780
you look at the top 10 most valued

118
00:07:50,760 --> 00:08:02,340
companies we see that seven of them

119
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:05,849
seven of them are the companies that

120
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:09,239
mostly generate their value or sorcerer

121
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:13,790
value from intellectual property so it

122
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:17,370
clearly illustrates that companies that

123
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:19,410
focus on intellectual property may have

124
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:23,910
an advantage over traditional companies

125
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:30,030
that use machines or hold or all

126
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:32,930
machines but only to two percent of

127
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:37,020
patents are commercially successful

128
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:41,039
generate a hundred and eighty billion

129
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:45,329
all license payments or license fees per

130
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:50,040
year so there's no question about why

131
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:52,260
it's only two percent let's look at the

132
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:55,890
other number look at the other number a

133
00:08:52,260 --> 00:09:00,120
hundred and eighty billion dollars in

134
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:01,980
annual payments these fees are these

135
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:06,560
payments the right to receive this

136
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,560
premise has to be protected legally and

137
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:22,740
that there is a clear indication that

138
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:25,830
lawyers are a necessary component in the

139
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,510
success of any tech company and there is

140
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:30,300
an opinion that lawyers don't like

141
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:32,580
technologies that our technology folk -

142
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:36,810
tech phobic people but that's nothing

143
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:39,870
that's completely true so none of these

144
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:44,069
come gnarly successful companies would

145
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:47,790
be successful if it were not for lawyers

146
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:49,860
well lawyers are conservative and comes

147
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:53,760
to technology where the use of

148
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:57,959
technology but nevertheless they are an

149
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:04,589
essential element in the commercial

150
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:11,149
success of these companies the most

151
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:15,690
important factor that slows down the

152
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:18,209
development is the lack of the lack of

153
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:22,470
communication and I'm very pleased to

154
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:27,680
see so many people here although with we

155
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:31,440

locate the path often fill the Prairie

169
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:33,949
sounds like the path of some samurai the

170
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:39,210
dosmo samurai

171
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:45,000
it reminds you of that but anyway when

172
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:46,740
you develop a software product oh my our

173
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:53,390
company called software products our

174
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:53,390
company are just like any developer is

175
00:11:53,960 --> 00:12:04,890
faced with the question of intellectual

176
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:07,260
property protection it doesn't matter

177
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:11,460
what intellectual property we're talking

178
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:17,700
about I beyond software or hardware or a

179
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:22,800
hardware software system up to 50% of

180
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:27,210
the up to 50% of their money that we pay

181
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:33,660
to our employees our staff our engineers

182
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:40,560
and developers we spend on making sure

183
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:44,300
that our product is not used freely by

184
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:48,859
other there are not basically copied I

185
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,859
would say I would put it like that

186
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:57,330
currently

187
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:10,130
as I believe of the age of total piracy

188
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:14,180
is over there are very main technologies

189
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:17,630
and - if that make it very difficult or

190
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:28,089
impossible to copy services and

191
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:34,960
technologies that basically prohibit

192
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:38,060
anyone from unsanctioned copying however

193
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:41,560
there's always the question of open

194
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:45,709
access to data from inside

195
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:49,880
in other words won't we have people

196
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:59,060
working on a program product we do not

197
00:13:49,880 --> 00:14:04,720
always we are not always know whether

198
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:04,719
the employee gave us all the data

199
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:16,869
sorry perhaps I'm not making much sense

200
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:20,510
I have probably have I probably have to

201
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:23,570
stop looking at my notes and so the

202
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:25,490
Civil Code regular not the labor code

203
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:28,540
that the Civil Code regulates the

204
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:31,910
relationship between the employee and

205
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:38,920
between an employee and she's her

206
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:44,350
employer so we have to be guided by the

207
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:44,349
documents related to ownership transfer

208
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:49,899
for example if you have a project

209
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:49,899
management system

210
00:14:53,069 --> 00:15:01,290
we use our own system but people may use

211
00:14:57,249 --> 00:15:06,149
and other systems related to how this

212
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:10,529
step is regulated when he is the right

213
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:14,249
when does the right to a product emerge

214
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:14,249
very often

215
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:21,250
coders at a large number of coders

216
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:24,550
migrate from organization to

217
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:28,330
organization there's no guarantee that

218
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:31,240
in three four years the code that was

219
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:34,959
written in our company will not be

220
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:40,330
written in another company or in the

221
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:46,899
market and there is a clear mechanism

222
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:49,060
and is a clear set of measures that will

223
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:58,029
allow us to protect ourselves against

224
00:15:49,060 --> 00:16:01,149
these actions is unlawful actions let's

225
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:04,050
conduct a thought experiment for example

226
00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:10,720
one employee was working on a product

227
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:14,740
and at a certain point left the company

228
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:19,690
and then a similar company as a similar

229
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:22,120
a product is created in a competing in a

230
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:24,580
competing company a product that has the

231
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:28,000
same set of error a set of mistakes and

232
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:33,330
so forth so it's a clear case of copying

233
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,330
and I as an employer as an employer

234
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:51,290
have to spend a lot of time and

235
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:54,350
resources to to prove that the product

236
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:59,510
really belongs to us that requires time

237
00:16:54,350 --> 00:17:03,130
that requires a lot of code review so

238
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:03,130
the question is

239
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:14,499
[Music]

240
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:27,349
so our experience shows that a good and

241
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:33,400
well-structured corporate document

242
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:38,120
management system that covers servers

243
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:41,440
second from the employee boils task

244
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:44,800
assignment task performance monitoring

245
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:49,070
test completion monitoring and a

246
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:54,860
well-structured legal strategy for the

247
00:17:49,070 --> 00:18:03,980
protection of IEP Souls all the problems

248
00:17:54,860 --> 00:18:09,409
listed all the transfer should be should

249
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:15,220
be fixed should be a kind of recorded by

250
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:19,490
a document there should be an act and

251
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:25,220
this act is a serious argument is a

252
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:31,240
serious proof that the code belongs to

253
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:34,930
you and not your competitors currently

254
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,930
our company

255
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:42,418
owns non-material asses

256
00:18:49,410 --> 00:19:07,200
and the main capital our company is its

257
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:09,659
people and code so what our what's of

258
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:14,010
the colons we'll be talking about going

259
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:17,130
forward has to do with an electronic

260
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:23,150
code deposit system electronic document

261
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:27,060
management which really helps have

262
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:30,230
helped our leaders company managers to

263
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,230
have peace of mind

264
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:46,950
will give us an opportunity to protect

265
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:50,560
our IP to protect ourselves against

266
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:54,160
unauthorized copying projector ideas and

267
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:56,649
I hope that our experience that we can

268
00:19:54,160 --> 00:20:03,550
share with you will help you to protect

269
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:07,420
your products and I am ready to answer

270
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:11,110
your questions I'd like to apologize for

271
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:14,500
my presentation which was perhaps a

272
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:17,590
little disorganized so I believe that

273
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:22,080
maybe in a year my presentation will be

274
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:30,010
better structured so that's it thank you

275
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:33,810
thank you if you have questions so we

276
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:33,810
will leave them until the end

277
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:43,350
I suggest that we move on

278
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:55,950
hi everybody I have a calling

279
00:20:54,269 --> 00:20:59,460
she's gonna make the second part of the

280
00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:03,509
presentation my name is Nikki okay

281
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:05,960
sheriff and I could use a slide changer

282
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:05,960
please

283
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,469
[Music]

284
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:28,150
a couple of words about what we do we

285
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:29,980
develop machine learning based software

286
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:32,080
we have been doing this for five years

287
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:34,110
we develop large system for error

288
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:39,220
thought as Burbank at prom sewage bunk

289
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:42,689
and many industrial organizations and we

290
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:45,790
have developed our own understanding of

291
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:48,490
what happens within the area of data

292
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:51,670
analytics and myself and Galina will

293
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:54,370
share our vision with you and what it

294
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:58,240
means for portland development perhaps

295
00:21:54,370 --> 00:22:00,580
you are not familiar with data science

296
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,650
perhaps we should have a coffee so the

297
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:06,189
data scientists statisticians

298
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:07,780
mathematicians and machine learning they

299
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:13,660
work with programming languages or

300
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:16,990
Python they they need to understand

301
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:19,360
MySQL and SQL like languages these

302
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:25,050
people can visualize data prepare

303
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:28,620
presentations and people who understand

304
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:32,200
Hadoop and other distributed computation

305
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:34,719
systems so what's the problem ethics of

306
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:38,110
this industry a specialized generation

307
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:42,990
here are quite expensive there are not a

308
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:45,550
lot of such specialists but the

309
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:49,450
there is a lot of demand for these

310
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:52,570
specialists I don't remember

311
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:59,110
coming to a company that had data

312
00:22:52,570 --> 00:23:08,399
scientists on staff on the payroll so

313
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:08,399
the growth of revenue is about 10% and

314
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:18,220
every year tens of thousands of

315
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:21,669
specialists are trained in different

316
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:24,700
courses so this is what the fastest

317
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:30,130
growing professions who are the

318
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:33,760
participants of the process if you

319
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:38,050
manager that is responsible for data

320
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:40,240
analysis debt review these people want

321
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:43,510
to increase the bottom line increase the

322
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:48,450
capitalization of the company in cotan

323
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:50,860
by putting more IPO the balance because

324
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:52,620
these companies usually work with

325
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:58,179
commercial information sensitive data

326
00:23:52,620 --> 00:24:02,320
that may be taken advantage of by a

327
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:05,410
competitor modern and that analysts no

328
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,960
matter how hard we try to change this as

329
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:10,240
to tasks so he wants to solve two

330
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:14,290
interesting tasks and he wants to have

331
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:18,390
good conditions the average life cycle

332
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:24,690
is six months I don't know what to do

333
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:24,690
companies fight this problem startups

334
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:32,289
startup startup serum create options for

335
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:35,049
this end data scientists like to move

336
00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:39,090
from company to company it's a very

337
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:47,710
creative job the industry is very very

338
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:50,379
you there is no off-the-shelf machine

339
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:53,250
learning model for every case so you

340
00:24:50,379 --> 00:24:59,039
have to create in your model for every

341
00:24:53,250 --> 00:25:02,379
specific case however there are

342
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:07,929
requirements of specialist for econ or

343
00:25:02,379 --> 00:25:11,019
local max and it's convenient everything

344
00:25:07,929 --> 00:25:16,570
is stored in a local notebook and you

345
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:20,409
can do everything this notebook is only

346
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:24,700
perhaps protected by some password and

347
00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:27,820
login undocumented work a lot of

348
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:34,570
undocumented work an expensive

349
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:37,418
specialist cannot spend time on comment

350
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:45,340
and code for data scientist that's

351
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:48,789
normal data science is 85% RNG you can

352
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:51,519
you can take issue with this there are a

353
00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:55,360
lot of iterations and before an

354
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:57,370
interesting sometimes we're talking

355
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,309
about thousands of a duration iterations

356
00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:05,408
and sometimes it's just stored on a

357
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:07,178
local laptop so we don't know we don't

358
00:26:05,409 --> 00:26:09,970
have any information about what this

359
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:12,970
data scientist was doing and the end

360
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:15,159
result is a machine learning model which

361
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:25,019
is just a file with some extension which

362
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:27,850
can be put on a flash drive this can

363
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:30,909
impact negatively at the financial

364
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:34,090
results of the company and so on this

365
00:26:30,909 --> 00:26:36,970
specialist gets an interesting proposal

366
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:39,759
from another company for example it

367
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:41,980
doesn't have to be a competitor he or

368
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:45,759
she comes to that company and brings

369
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:49,600
with him/her all that was done in

370
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:53,320
previous company if that can in fact

371
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:56,139
boost the competitors position and the

372
00:26:53,320 --> 00:27:00,689
fact that can undermine the reputation

373
00:26:56,139 --> 00:27:04,029
of the previous company for example also

374
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:05,220
the data scientist can launch his or her

375
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:08,559
own company

376
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:12,340
third inside the company we have a

377
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:16,000
transfer information on flash stick or

378
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:17,529
data sets data sets may be lost for

379
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,259
example a company may spend a lot of

380
00:27:17,529 --> 00:27:22,960
time and resources on collecting data

381
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:25,649
and creating this data set and then when

382
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:29,289
it when a data scientists decides to

383
00:27:25,649 --> 00:27:38,289
move on to another company he or she can

384
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:42,090
take data set with so the company the

385
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:49,059
company may lose

386
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:53,889
the losers position and the the this is

387
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:55,559
what it can amount losses and we see a

388
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:58,919
lot of stories about that

389
00:27:55,559 --> 00:28:01,899
people have raised the question of

390
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:03,640
measuring the monetary value of digital

391
00:28:01,899 --> 00:28:11,080
assets we're trying to do the same thing

392
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:16,740
with Karina we have we have the average

393
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:20,799
paycheck in Moscow we have the average

394
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:22,330
among number of people in a team three

395
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:25,059
to five specialists of different

396
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:29,549
profiles and the average duration of a

397
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:38,168
product of a project three to six months

398
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:42,510
these are the data and these this is the

399
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:49,210
result so the average that's the average

400
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:51,549
monetary value of one model of one

401
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:55,450
single model and in experiments you can

402
00:28:51,549 --> 00:28:57,908
have multiple models you know I didn't

403
00:28:55,450 --> 00:29:07,120
mention the fact that these models can

404
00:28:57,909 --> 00:29:13,270
be disruptive and you can also apply all

405
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:17,049
sorts of factors and multipliers so

406
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:20,429
that's a very unpleasant thing so we as

407
00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:24,340
a team that develops software for our

408
00:29:20,429 --> 00:29:30,340
clients we constantly are faced with

409
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:36,520
this issue also you can

410
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:40,389
you can have the employees to sign an

411
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:45,660
NDA to lock the flash drives but it

412
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:45,660
doesn't work that doesn't work very much

413
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:57,060
people people like to people do not like

414
00:29:53,370 --> 00:30:03,520
companies that try to stifle them as

415
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:07,000
creative personalities that a tries to

416
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:09,129
limit their freedom and they end up in

417
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:16,630
other companies that do not impose such

418
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:21,340
strict limitations so these are the

419
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:25,330
three reasons for data loss for data

420
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:30,850
leaks data is not recorded it's not

421
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:36,490
dumped anywhere there is no agreement

422
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:40,230
there is no good agreement between the

423
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:40,230
employer and the employee

424
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:46,030
[Music]

425
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:48,280
very often we find ourselves in

426
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:51,310
situations when there is a conflict for

427
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:53,530
when there is a when we think that our

428
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:57,040
data has been stolen by the previous

429
00:30:53,530 --> 00:31:00,760
employer employee but look at the

430
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:02,740
agreement and it turns out that Lydia

431
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:11,440
nothing has been broken nothing has been

432
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:14,290
violated and also a very often in fact

433
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,860
the majority company that majority of

434
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:20,100
companies do not require those data

435
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:23,229
scientists to work on local machines

436
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:27,310
every data scientist has his/her own

437
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:29,740
notebook a laptop at that he or she

438
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:34,360
carries with him her all the time and

439
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:37,780
has all the work on them on on that

440
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:48,899
machine and that is not good in terms of

441
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:52,540
data security the question of IP write

442
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:56,140
protection is becoming more and more

443
00:31:52,540 --> 00:32:00,520
relevant especially especially is there

444
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:03,760
a request from society startups that's

445
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:09,910
very often run into the problem of data

446
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:15,420
protection so what we do we we do all

447
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:22,290
the paperwork for IP registration we do

448
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:22,290
patent troll protection we

449
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:32,620
we create all the necessary safeguards

450
00:32:28,409 --> 00:32:35,289
we hope companies safe help companies to

451
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:40,510
increase their capitalization the

452
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:42,399
capitalisation grows proportionally to

453
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:49,059
the number of patents that a company

454
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:54,520
holds the work that data science does

455
00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:57,158
it's not done in local notebook but it's

456
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:59,830
done in the cloud it is convenient it is

457
00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:02,080
good we know this because we are

458
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:05,408
specialists ourselves we know this but

459
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:08,199
the results of the work are held in the

460
00:33:05,409 --> 00:33:09,700
cloud and they cannot just be stolen

461
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,789
from there everything is loaded

462
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:14,620
everything is backed up all the

463
00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:27,520
activities all the business processes

464
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:31,389
and so so in average the whole thing

465
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:34,470
takes about six months and the cost of

466
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:38,289
all this business will be six to ten

467
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:43,210
million roubles for half a year and

468
00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:47,919
longer so as a business owner I won't

469
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:51,399
have to invest a lot of money the

470
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:53,230
analyst will like this thing because

471
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:56,080
before developing this thing we ran

472
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:59,320
about 30 deep interviews with potential

473
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:05,730
customers Indian users data engineers

474
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:05,730
data analysts who use the system who

475
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:12,879
suggested us or ideas of more than 150

476
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:15,489
features it has the most excessive I

477
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:18,520
think from the set of functionality in

478
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:21,790
Russia there are competitors abroad but

479
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:25,869
we talk about Russia l invite you to

480
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:30,070
join us yes we just proceeded from the

481
00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:33,250
idea the developers and technicians

482
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:39,429
don't like lawyers a lot as has been

483
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:41,800
rightly said and we were thinking how to

484
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:44,139
build a process in such a way that the

485
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:49,210
law is there but you don't feel them may

486
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:51,669
be there so you can embed the legal

487
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:55,179
function in the process in such a way so

488
00:34:51,668 --> 00:34:57,819
that the work should go on the documents

489
00:34:55,179 --> 00:35:01,140
should be generated but no cognitive

490
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:06,910
dissonance would happen when a lawyer

491
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:09,190
would be asking the programmers where's

492
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:10,990
the code please download the code and

493
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:14,200
it's in the FIPS so why can't you do

494
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:15,939
that why is it so difficult and not all

495
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:19,509
lawyers know what the docker container

496
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:21,790
is how its impact and that sending the

497
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:24,760
code into word doesn't give you a lot

498
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:27,400
so therefore the technical solution that

499
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:31,480
we designed and that we are implementing

500
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:33,849
is based on processes and it's the

501
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:36,250
development processes that are taken as

502
00:35:33,849 --> 00:35:38,740
a foundation or as the legal function is

503
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:42,280
actually embedded on top of them and so

504
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:45,220
in order to create the legally

505
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:48,670
sufficient document flow to prove the to

506
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:52,029
form the evidence based so when you get

507
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:54,250
into conflict the lawyer will be able to

508
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:56,920
download the papers from the system and

509
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:59,770
they will have some value as evidence

510
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:02,440
for the court over the third parties in

511
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:06,099
order to send out claims in order to

512
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:09,369
protect your rights and no developer and

513
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:12,390
no lawyer will suffer from that that was

514
00:36:09,369 --> 00:36:15,970
our purpose and our goal and

515
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:20,230
correspondingly this is how we see the

516
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:25,060
professional work process this is a

517
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:29,619
model of a professionals work in or

518
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:32,769
Indies us with R&D in this case

519
00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:36,460
it starts with knowledge digitization

520
00:36:32,769 --> 00:36:38,098
and a search for new solutions not

521
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:43,240
everything that we're going to use

522
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:46,180
looking forward has existed not all that

523
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:48,368
we had generated will remain we're

524
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:51,609
testing lots of different models that's

525
00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:55,089
why the system implies a variability

526
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:57,578
that's why it backs up everyday so that

527
00:36:55,089 --> 00:36:59,890
we could keep the base version so that

528
00:36:57,579 --> 00:37:02,079
even a year after we could go back and

529
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:05,618
see what hypotheses we had and what

530
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:08,319
result results they brought us to we use

531
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:14,519
data so it's not only software code but

532
00:37:08,319 --> 00:37:19,990
it's also about databases where you log

533
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:21,640
adjacent rights and also depositing what

534
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:25,359
does it mean for the before developers

535
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:27,759
it means that the data model can't be

536
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:30,578
used C it means that if we've developed

537
00:37:27,759 --> 00:37:33,099
a Goods database model we got an

538
00:37:30,579 --> 00:37:37,150
advantage a competitive advantage the

539
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:40,180
knowledge of the employees so it's a

540
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:43,299
thing that is difficult to capitalize

541
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:45,819
except for IBM experience a company that

542
00:37:43,299 --> 00:37:49,690
can work with them but these are ways to

543
00:37:45,819 --> 00:37:52,739
solve a problem sometimes companies even

544
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:55,869
know this they perceive it as something

545
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:58,180
not important and suggest an algorithm

546
00:37:55,869 --> 00:38:01,359
not a code it's not a problem but it's

547
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:03,308
these algorithms that have value and it

548
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:06,519
all can be embedded in the system so

549
00:38:03,309 --> 00:38:09,640
that it could be worked with britta'd

550
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:13,299
environments where assets are generated

551
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:15,279
gurgi mensch explains this thing it's

552
00:38:13,299 --> 00:38:21,579
important that it should be a system the

553
00:38:15,279 --> 00:38:22,989
developer shouldn't be made to give

554
00:38:21,579 --> 00:38:26,170
anything to a lawyer

555
00:38:22,989 --> 00:38:30,269
it should just happen automatically so

556
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:33,339
digital assets going through the

557
00:38:30,269 --> 00:38:35,390
document process turned into outcomes

558
00:38:33,339 --> 00:38:39,080
the outcomes

559
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:42,220
of those types that can be protected

560
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:47,360
legally as copyright adjacent right

561
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:51,259
items or know-how after this assessment

562
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:53,630
or evaluation is made and it's these

563
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:57,680
outcomes that can be including the

564
00:38:53,630 --> 00:39:00,170
balance sheet they get depreciated and

565
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,120
amortized just like fixed assets but you

566
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:09,770
don't need to pay taxes for them because

567
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:18,650
now there's a tax break on intangible

568
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:22,370
assets which is very good this is an

569
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:25,910
example a practical case case for

570
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:29,509
experience with rights registration this

571
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:30,920
is what we get at the inputs the

572
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:35,540
information the results this is a

573
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:41,180
trigger that gets I guess files on

574
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:44,570
events when like release is a rolled out

575
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:48,049
in production it happens once a week or

576
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:51,140
on demand and this is what we get we get

577
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:54,350
not only documents it's important that

578
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:57,049
we get the item as such which means that

579
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:59,120
we have something to compare with in all

580
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:02,030
cases where we download part of the

581
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:04,609
source codes you know depositing FIPS we

582
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:06,920
don't get anything and that can be

583
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:09,170
unplugged back again to prove the

584
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:12,260
functionality of the system so in case

585
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:13,580
of illegal conflicts we'll bring a city

586
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:16,850
situation that you won't be able to

587
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:21,350
prove the system works does work in this

588
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:24,799
case we download the entire code base it

589
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:27,200
can be restored to a certain extent we

590
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,610
get protected from internal threats if

591
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:33,020
for instance the files have been deleted

592
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:35,090
or a laptop has been lost we can restore

593
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:39,910
the entire process of work and take a

594
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:42,710
look at how it worked that's why this is

595
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:48,980
how we see the solution

596
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:51,290
that covers the entire process from the

597
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:54,620
start of development collecting the R&D

598
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:57,110
data all the way to the end result that

599
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:59,000
the company can use in order to organize

600
00:40:57,110 --> 00:41:04,040
the work of their smart employees

601
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:06,620
it covers all tasks that the head of the

602
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:08,270
company may set for the employees

603
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:12,650
doesn't create discomfort for the

604
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:14,870
employees doesn't generate NTA animosity

605
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:17,270
towards lawyers because they don't see

606
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:19,390
part of the background processes that

607
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:23,990
happening but we're achieving the goal

608
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:28,520
at a stage where the analysts user

609
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:31,069
starts using the system they don't have

610
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:34,430
to make any actions like signing

611
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:37,190
documents there are no pop-out screens

612
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:39,230
to do something they keep working just

613
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:40,520
like they what we've always done it's

614
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:43,640
very important this is the user

615
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:46,520
experience that we want to offer them

616
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:48,890
you don't want to touch creative people

617
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:52,160
they should be focusing on what they can

618
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:54,020
do well all IP protection processes

619
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:57,020
happen in parallel there are triggers

620
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:59,540
the triggers can be set up in the system

621
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:02,750
you can be situation where a release the

622
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:06,230
production may happen you know we deploy

623
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:09,410
a certain version to production or just

624
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:11,540
once a week well we just dump everything

625
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:13,430
that we've developed all this we call a

626
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:18,170
situation where the ad hoc situation

627
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:21,799
where the user said I want to fix the IP

628
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:25,400
rights now and it's happens it all gets

629
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:27,200
documented immediately all the documents

630
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:30,650
second regenerated and the company

631
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:35,060
becomes an owner the formal owner of all

632
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:38,360
the assets that they have well and in

633
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:40,850
conclusion regardless of how you're

634
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:43,190
going to maintain your process there are

635
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:44,960
three pieces of advice that would like

636
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:47,630
to give you they are very important and

637
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:51,260
you can implement them use them in your

638
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:52,510
work so we start with what Victor

639
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:56,700
mentioned

640
00:42:52,510 --> 00:43:01,900
how a developer company can prove that

641
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:07,089
they have these rights we get to into

642
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:12,940
the sphere of evidence and this can be

643
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:19,090
done in any phone it's can be done

644
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:23,280
through the memos printing out the

645
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:27,220
source codes internal documentation and

646
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:31,840
agreements with the employees but this

647
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:34,180
documentation is needed for the company

648
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:38,920
to get some outcome and not just having

649
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:42,160
spent some money on paying salaries to

650
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:46,950
these professionalism right signing

651
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:51,509
documents is important and part of the

652
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:56,049
developers being a freelancers or

653
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:59,440
part-time they knew you need to sign any

654
00:43:56,050 --> 00:44:04,290
agreements with them actually any types

655
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:07,980
of agreements can be signs alienation

656
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:10,390
authorship order and execution any

657
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:13,420
documents that would be proof of

658
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:15,970
something real having been generated our

659
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:19,060
source code data set model design

660
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:22,959
anything that the company may need it

661
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:24,970
can exist you don't need to get limited

662
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:28,380
by the category or an employment

663
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:33,700
contract and this practice so if

664
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:36,550
employees leave you twice a year then

665
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:38,169
having them sign documents once a

666
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:41,619
quarter you protect the company from

667
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:45,400
them leaving you in the next quarter

668
00:44:41,619 --> 00:44:48,100
it's a good model that allows you to do

669
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:51,430
something the first step to get a real

670
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:53,470
outcome from the investments that you've

671
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:55,359
made in development I have a question by

672
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:57,069
the way we once had a story in the

673
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,730
project when we were developing a

674
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:01,900
project in the company and then

675
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:03,780
professionals who took part this project

676
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:06,900
after the project was closed

677
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:09,540
were awarded a bonus of 1000 rubles and

678
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:11,880
then they explained to us that this was

679
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:14,880
one of the ways for the organization to

680
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:17,610
get protected to get their rights

681
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:20,070
protected yes it does work this way this

682
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:22,790
amount can be it can be any amount it

683
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:26,180
could be a hundred rubles but any amount

684
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:29,820
which has a certain designation

685
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:34,049
indicated and can actually help you

686
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:39,240
track the results can't be used for that

687
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:41,700
because being salary you don't pay the

688
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:44,520
authorship remuneration so by default

689
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:47,669
authorship remuneration is not part of

690
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:51,120
salary no we're in the labor codes you

691
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:53,970
have a statement that the salary covers

692
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:55,799
all your expenses to create the results

693
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:58,620
of international charity is for this

694
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:01,470
reason that companies includes a clause

695
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:04,620
at some part let's say ten percent of

696
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:08,000
the salary are paid exactly for

697
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:10,859
generating the outcomes of an employee's

698
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,500
operation as an identity of the

699
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:16,170
employment contract and it is exactly

700
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:17,850
this that allows saying that the rights

701
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:20,600
have been transferred to the company

702
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:23,130
because before being paid you can't say

703
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:25,589
that the rights have been transferred

704
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:29,220
because the Civil Code will be broken in

705
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:30,440
this part thank you I now understand so

706
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:33,330
basically that's it

707
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:39,350
Antonina kyoki thank you very much and

708
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:39,350
vitaly is going to close our session

709
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:58,500
I welcome all the participants in this

710
00:46:55,020 --> 00:47:01,920
session I remind you my name is Natalia

711
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:03,270
Shogun a patent attorney there are of

712
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,540
the Russian Federation

713
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:08,610
I do evaluation of patents I had a

714
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:11,600
company called patent family group and

715
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:15,810
I'm going to talk about patents today I

716
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:20,310
decided to start with asking you a few

717
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:24,779
provocative questions think I got the

718
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:28,250
answer so what where is the resemblance

719
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:32,310
between aids and intellectual property

720
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:36,860
well luckily these there's only one

721
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:41,759
thing in common I would put it this way

722
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:46,470
you know to heat up the atmosphere it

723
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:50,510
touches upon everyone today are you just

724
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:53,368
can't ignore either of these two things

725
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:56,840
because as you know not knowing the Lord

726
00:47:53,369 --> 00:48:00,390
is not relieve you of the liability

727
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:02,580
because a lot of people have long been

728
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:05,368
informed by AIDS but there are still a

729
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:09,920
lot of questions and misperceptions

730
00:48:05,369 --> 00:48:11,369
about IP and I'll try you to dispel them

731
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:16,950
for you

732
00:48:11,369 --> 00:48:20,760
in my presentation firstly regarding

733
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:24,149
threats putting it numbers why it's a

734
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:26,280
bad idea to infringe upon other people's

735
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:29,220
rights there are different types of

736
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:32,520
liability in the law for that some of

737
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:38,270
them are about fines to the government

738
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:42,050
others are about reimbursements to the

739
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:46,259
defender to the claim claimant and the

740
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:49,260
basic idea is not to break somebody's

741
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:52,230
rights now regarding at a probability

742
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:54,450
this slide shows you of the dynamic of

743
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:57,450
patenting in different years all over

744
00:48:54,450 --> 00:49:00,089
the world how many patents were issued

745
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:02,848
in IT security

746
00:49:00,089 --> 00:49:06,859
so that's why you can see this slide

747
00:49:02,849 --> 00:49:09,439
there are lots of patterns here and also

748
00:49:06,859 --> 00:49:13,410
they are becoming more and more numerous

749
00:49:09,439 --> 00:49:16,439
every year for instance last year almost

750
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:18,899
well about 13,000 such patterns were

751
00:49:16,439 --> 00:49:25,529
issued which means that our energy is

752
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:29,509
going on at a fast pace and right owners

753
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:34,410
rights are being protective protected

754
00:49:29,509 --> 00:49:38,569
now it's by geography you see that most

755
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:40,920
patterns are of course issued in the US

756
00:49:38,569 --> 00:49:42,779
Asian countries are there there are some

757
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:46,529
patterns in Russia as well the slide

758
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:49,979
shows a number of patents issued since

759
00:49:46,529 --> 00:49:52,439
the year 2000 in Russia and at all it's

760
00:49:49,979 --> 00:49:56,249
all about IT security I'm reminding you

761
00:49:52,439 --> 00:49:58,469
about 1200 patents have been issued in

762
00:49:56,249 --> 00:50:01,410
Russia and more than a half of them are

763
00:49:58,469 --> 00:50:05,500
still in force today so you can't ignore

764
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:07,788
them when you do some development

765
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:11,459
[Music]

766
00:50:07,789 --> 00:50:15,509
another important point we are now

767
00:50:11,459 --> 00:50:18,499
talking about the patent law it's very

768
00:50:15,509 --> 00:50:22,289
important and not to confuse it with

769
00:50:18,499 --> 00:50:26,509
computer software which could be

770
00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:32,089
regarded as part of copyright law

771
00:50:26,509 --> 00:50:34,650
different ways of controlling it can be

772
00:50:32,089 --> 00:50:39,119
applied as discussed in the previous

773
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:42,660
presentation but if you consider it as

774
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:47,029
far as as an invention the very essence

775
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:50,189
the content is getting protected and so

776
00:50:47,029 --> 00:50:53,309
just for the sake of clarity I decided

777
00:50:50,189 --> 00:50:56,670
to offer your case here in the screen

778
00:50:53,309 --> 00:50:59,519
you can see a fragments of a patent that

779
00:50:56,670 --> 00:51:05,160
exists today that belongs to Kaspersky

780
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:07,799
Lab that protects a way a method of a

781
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:10,569
web resource verification it only

782
00:51:07,799 --> 00:51:12,460
consists of two steps the first step

783
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:15,310
as the parameters of verification and

784
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:16,780
second step now is the verification is

785
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:18,460
done of course there are some details as

786
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:23,500
how it's happened but you can look up

787
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:25,720
this text is actually the object of

788
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:27,730
protection which means that if you are

789
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:30,640
going to verify web resources through

790
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:33,160
these steps you are going to infringe

791
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:36,670
upon this patent and so the kind of

792
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:41,170
liability for that has been shown in the

793
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:45,510
previous slides so I hope that you

794
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:47,560
understood that these computer software

795
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:50,860
the computer software

796
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:52,660
oh I mean if you don't want to be print

797
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:56,850
you infringe upon somebody's rights it's

798
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:56,850
just not to copy the code with

799
00:51:57,570 --> 00:52:03,520
inventions the situation it looks a

800
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:05,350
difference you need to run some patent

801
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,830
search compare it with your own

802
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:11,170
developments and make the right choices

803
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:14,799
it's always good a good idea to involve

804
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:18,790
a professional for that my company by

805
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:20,680
the way does it very well but if you do

806
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:22,630
it yourselves you should bear in mind

807
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:25,359
the following things firstly you should

808
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:29,200
be concerned only about patterns which

809
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:37,360
are still still effective because every

810
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:42,580
patent has a maturity date secondly all

811
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:44,410
patents are limited in the territory of

812
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:48,400
the applicability of have found some

813
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:50,440
indonesian patent which may be still

814
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:53,110
active but you only because you only

815
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:54,700
work in russia in the USA you may not be

816
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:59,920
concerned because it's not going to

817
00:52:54,700 --> 00:53:03,009
cover a russia most patents includes a

818
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:06,700
lot of text but you only need to be

819
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:09,460
concerned by the only part of this text

820
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:13,200
which is called a formula in russian or

821
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:17,920
claims in english this is the part that

822
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:21,279
defines the scope of protection and the

823
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,720
final detail when running the search you

824
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,569
need to

825
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:28,660
look not only at the developments as a

826
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:32,619
whole or with similar solution but also

827
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:35,980
to take accounts of separate parts this

828
00:53:32,619 --> 00:53:40,410
is an example of decomposing the a

829
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:44,440
patent when globally the IT security

830
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:46,629
system was being assessed makes sense

831
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:48,280
that it consists of several subsystems

832
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:53,470
implementing different projects

833
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:56,530
processes and we need to get concerned

834
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:59,890
about specific components like scanning

835
00:53:56,530 --> 00:54:02,770
because they're also parts of protected

836
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:08,368
items covered by patents and we need not

837
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:11,680
to infringe upon them let's now go to

838
00:54:08,369 --> 00:54:13,480
the advantages if you've made sure that

839
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:17,890
you're not breaking anybody's patents

840
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:19,750
this is the minimum plan you can move to

841
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:22,569
the maximum plan building your own

842
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:25,329
patent portfolio if for instance you

843
00:54:22,569 --> 00:54:27,730
don't understand why people get lots of

844
00:54:25,329 --> 00:54:30,819
patents registered I've tried to

845
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:32,710
formulate the main reasons why patents

846
00:54:30,819 --> 00:54:35,290
the main thing is that it's kind of

847
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:37,540
insurance you may not be concerned about

848
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:40,660
somebody patenting your development

849
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:44,109
standing in the way for you to use it

850
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:46,200
second you in this way you can become

851
00:54:44,109 --> 00:54:50,140
kind of threat for your competitors

852
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:53,379
taken together it gives you offers you a

853
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:56,140
strong position in your conversations

854
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:58,599
with investors who'll see your

855
00:54:56,140 --> 00:55:05,049
initiative as better protected and

856
00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:08,230
secured additionally a patent is an

857
00:55:05,049 --> 00:55:10,690
opportunity to move to a new level of

858
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:16,180
relationship with partners it's about

859
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:19,839
licensing agreements and that involves

860
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:22,359
some money flows and also regarding

861
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:25,210
something already mentioned today any

862
00:55:22,359 --> 00:55:28,390
patent is an asset is an intangible

863
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:30,940
asset in large international companies

864
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:31,970
and tangible assets account for more

865
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:34,960
than a half

866
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:40,100
of the value of the entire business and

867
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:44,570
if we get closer to our reality it's an

868
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:48,069
asset that you can make parts of the

869
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:48,070
capital of your organization

870
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:55,450
selling the remainder to an investor for

871
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:58,340
a real cash and this is quite a popular

872
00:55:55,450 --> 00:56:02,419
investment scheme where you get a

873
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:05,770
startup it has a patent and basically

874
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:08,870
that's used for getting the money to

875
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:10,670
develop their business so this brings me

876
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:13,759
to the end of my presentation thank you

877
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:16,460
very much for your attention and just

878
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:25,310
using this opportunity I'd like to say

879
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:30,860
that last year we ran a research of the

880
00:56:25,310 --> 00:56:33,860
Russian IT security markets and you can

881
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:36,470
find an overview of this research in a

882
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:40,340
blog thank you very much

883
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:43,640

884
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:46,300

885
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:48,710
you may have to speak as a one on one

886
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:52,220
thank you very much for your
