1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:06,229
hysterical mmm afternoon friends I'm

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:12,900
happy to see so many people at the first

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:14,130
presentation I think you will have a

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,580
good presentation

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:21,420
I'll tell you a lot of stories from my

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:25,080
practice I'm a bit sick so I'll drink

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:31,019
sip from time to time from this bottle I

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:37,349
am working in 40 guard labs in Singapore

9
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:40,649
it's part of 40 net in Singapore there

10
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:47,090
is a CFC Center of Interpol it's a cyber

11
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:50,219
fusion center CFC which joint efforts in

12
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:52,890
withstanding cyber criminal worldwide

13
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:56,730
were in the same city we interact quite

14
00:00:52,890 --> 00:01:00,170
closely we have an agreement between 40

15
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:03,809
Nets and Interpol and within that

16
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:07,260
agreement Interpol has the right to ask

17
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:14,580
for data in different samples and

18
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:19,880
different about malicious companies and

19
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:24,289
actors and we try to help Interpol such

20
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:28,979
requests highly confidential I cannot

21
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:32,790
discuss them here sometimes we do our

22
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:36,710
own investigations and we see that we

23
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:40,829
have a lot of evidence to identify

24
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:45,960
malicious actor we call the Interpol and

25
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:49,100
it helps us to generate a report and

26
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,298
pass it over to the national level

27
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,699
that's the second part of the

28
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:58,369
presentation but to begin with I will

29
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:03,010
tell you how we begin our negotiations

30
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:10,539
step one of any investigation

31
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:14,140
is operational saturation security of

32
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:20,230
course you cannot overestimate this

33
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:26,920
because first you shouldn't show

34
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:31,989
demonstrate your IP to the attacker and

35
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:35,739
then you wouldn't be able to get an

36
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:39,510
appropriate software because intruders

37
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:45,940
try to find out antivirus vendor IP

38
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:48,970
lists they classify addresses of

39
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:51,340
sandboxes and they have their own black

40
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:55,960
lists and they will never give their

41
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:59,470
malware to such IP so your IP should be

42
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:02,320
concealed hidden and there is also

43
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:04,560
prediction service when you will Google

44
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:08,739
something in the browser your browser

45
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:11,650
automatically goes to the first link of

46
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:15,070
the Google he will get the get request

47
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:20,110
and cache the answer if you try to

48
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:23,079
Google without hiding your IP you will

49
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:26,080
go to the site from your true IP and get

50
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:32,280
zero day from the prediction service

51
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:36,880
should be switched off disable and third

52
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:40,810
you should store all your URLs emails

53
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:48,100
and links in a secure manner if you

54
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:52,050
screen the points the headlines of the

55
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:57,040
protocol so that it wouldn't look like a

56
00:03:52,050 --> 00:04:01,150
valid link so in Skype for example if

57
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,970
you make a link to cage days your Skype

58
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:07,020
will go

59
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:11,880
you can use it has a unique user agent

60
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:17,209
and if you share this with a malicious

61
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:21,750
actor he will understand that somebody

62
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:26,390
understood this in your in the main in

63
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:30,960
Skype so someone is interested in him

64
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:37,650
after operation security I launched the

65
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:40,289
great table auditor create a new table

66
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:43,469
with the name of the investigation and

67
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:45,570
enter the facts the starting point can

68
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,850
be different sometimes it's a sample

69
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:51,570
sometimes it's a report about an

70
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:55,050
incident the task initially is to

71
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:58,140
disclose the facts and enter them into

72
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:01,740
the table and we have a column verified

73
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:08,219
then each fact should be verified I'll

74
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:18,210
tell you why why you shouldn't believe

75
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:21,240
any one story one virus we analyzed the

76
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:27,599
Chinese company and there was a rubber

77
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:31,830
exploit in wind rare in 2018 the virus

78
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:35,760
total you will see that according to

79
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:39,409
virus total this hash is linked to the

80
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:44,450
main which is shown here H and it means

81
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:48,150
Honduras when we analyzed the sample we

82
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:51,030
watched it in static in dynamic we

83
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:53,489
didn't find the domain then in Exadata

84
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:57,630
we found the place and realized that

85
00:05:53,490 --> 00:06:01,270
virus total just takes all bytes from

86
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:06,260
the sample and if

87
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:09,020
printed symbol printable symbols and you

88
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:12,650
have a lot of them then it's a stream if

89
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:14,359
it's there is a dot in the end and after

90
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,940
that there is something like that the

91
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:20,510
main he believes that this is a domain

92
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:22,550
name he doesn't check whether there is

93
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:25,520
such domain or not whether it is

94
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:32,030
registered the not he just sends you a

95
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:34,250
leak this so-called domain he thinks

96
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:38,030
that these dude

97
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:43,330
samples are linked so virustotal can

98
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:47,710
give you a wrong information story to

99
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:53,870
don't believe the reporters they joined

100
00:06:47,710 --> 00:07:00,799
reports of home security and FBI they

101
00:06:53,870 --> 00:07:03,470
merged two groups and it happens at the

102
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:07,010
end of December 2016

103
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:14,650
On January 1 there were a lot of

104
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:20,150
messages about malicious software found

105
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:23,299
in the company managed by Roush managers

106
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:28,179
elected power plants what happens in the

107
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:33,580
report it was recommended to install

108
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:37,670
indication of compromise IOC and the

109
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:41,000
security officer entered all iOS's into

110
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:44,120
the monitoring and on December 31 he

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,790
bought an alert that without that from

112
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:50,690
the network there was a malicious

113
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:55,280
traffic a malicious penetration attempt

114
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:58,520
what happened another officer came with

115
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:01,820
his notebook connected to the network

116
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:04,130
checked his mail in yahoo one of the IP

117
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:07,909
addresses in the indication of

118
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:13,370
compromise was a valid IP address of the

119
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:17,260
Yahoo Mail so you cannot believe

120
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:20,960
all reports and such incidents such

121
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:24,680
failures happen not only in the United

122
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,440
States here is a story from my personal

123
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:31,520
practice when I worked in Russia I got a

124
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:34,940
sample saying this is a malware please

125
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:38,720
detected I didn't find any malicious

126
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:43,610
software I said no I didn't find

127
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:47,060
malicious software they said no it's

128
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:57,230
malware this is a quote from the report

129
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:59,660
of Central Bank of Russia and the quote

130
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:01,970
was like that when we analyzed this

131
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:04,790
sample in the virtual machine there was

132
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:07,790
a connect to such IP addresses it means

133
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:10,670
that this is a malware I looked at the

134
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:13,160
IP addresses they are not in the

135
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:16,490
blacklist say Google them the first one

136
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:22,640
was VMware of update service and the

137
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:24,680
second one was Yandex matrix-y Yandex

138
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,380
matrix I don't know maybe they had

139
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:31,939
Yandex browser I told them that

140
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:35,689
according to our information they both

141
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:42,160
IP addresses were legal this is not

142
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:48,700
malware so take away you cannot believe

143
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:57,020
anyone at all but it's sort of a joke

144
00:09:48,700 --> 00:10:00,440
after ensuring operation security and

145
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:04,060
filling the table you get you bought

146
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:12,020
some samples you didn't see any evidence

147
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:16,189
try to find new samples how looking for

148
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:19,920
similar samples you have to save users

149
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:25,920
and the find and create

150
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:29,128
a tool which would look at records and

151
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:34,049
try to find a similar once you can use

152
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:39,540
your systems of search for the similar

153
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:41,009
samples that is installed in your

154
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,169
company but they are different at

155
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:47,660
different companies and in virustotal

156
00:10:43,169 --> 00:10:55,129
you can find several technologies

157
00:10:47,660 --> 00:11:00,988
non-strict hashes links rules

158
00:10:55,129 --> 00:11:05,069
everything is there you ristic records

159
00:11:00,989 --> 00:11:10,319
your estate rule is almost your rule but

160
00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:19,049
there is one difference between them who

161
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:23,368
knows which one rule create a lot of

162
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:27,629
falses with yuri stick record it cannot

163
00:11:23,369 --> 00:11:29,879
do that even in the noiseless mode when

164
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:34,230
it just sends you notifications and

165
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:37,220
doesn't delete anything you can have G

166
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:40,169
dos as a result from here and get

167
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:43,069
hundreds of thousands of modifications

168
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:48,319
but you will understand what happens

169
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:53,248
modify your rule and started the game

170
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:56,189
but commercialization takes place prices

171
00:11:53,249 --> 00:11:58,829
go up and retro hunts are more expensive

172
00:11:56,189 --> 00:12:02,819
than they used to be but then they can

173
00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:07,439
you can take information for the last

174
00:12:02,819 --> 00:12:11,890
year and not three months a few life

175
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:15,469
hacks as I told you you can have falses

176
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:19,370
so you found the string in the excel

177
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:24,920
file and many people when they write

178
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:34,780
your rules they limit search confining

179
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:45,079
into executable files one be found

180
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:50,810
phishing HTML page we believe we got

181
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:55,700
there through the name of the user so we

182
00:12:50,810 --> 00:13:01,099
found the phishing page in this way so

183
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:04,880
does not limit your search to do not

184
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:12,530
reduce it to executable files how can we

185
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:16,960
search in codes it's an art please do

186
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:22,430
not include absolute addresses and along

187
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:25,570
hopes for example in fin your report you

188
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:28,609
don't have any hashes there are some

189
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:32,690
researchers who publish reports without

190
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:36,860
any hashes and any domain you have to

191
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:39,380
guess what is happening what do you have

192
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:42,650
to do sometimes you have screenshots

193
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:46,820
then in screens using that screenshot

194
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:48,920
you can write rule and find samples this

195
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:53,540
is part of the code and I stressed

196
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:57,110
absolute addresses try to find this

197
00:13:53,540 --> 00:14:02,199
sample you wouldn't buy a piece of code

198
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:05,450
and use wildcards instead of absolute

199
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:10,900
addresses absolute addresses can be

200
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:17,120
easily changed at random or

201
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:19,160
by intention to lead you astray so these

202
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,080
are the samples what kind of evidence

203
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:29,620
can we have initially it was a big

204
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:33,260
section I wanted to teach you long but I

205
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:36,520
realized that it will take me long it

206
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:39,800
would take me one hour and eight minutes

207
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:43,970
so I the stories or technical part

208
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:45,500
stories are more important because you

209
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:48,320
cannot fight them in the Google

210
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:51,800
technical cases can be found in the

211
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,110
Google so these are the cases that

212
00:14:51,800 --> 00:15:00,020
attracted my attention in the last two

213
00:14:54,110 --> 00:15:03,410
years you know so you know everything

214
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:06,140
cabin crew after that case everyone

215
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:10,610
knows that in age pets there is meta

216
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:13,430
information when you analyze a picture

217
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:15,440
the size is different and the time of

218
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:19,250
its downloading is difference and the

219
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:22,070
picture itself is important and which I

220
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:25,840
will show you the real investigation and

221
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:30,110
how it helps when when you analyze a

222
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:36,440
file PE in this case you can use any

223
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:43,430
unique strings you --tx rich Keys file

224
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:47,840
names very important to analyze perfect

225
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:50,719
time of downloading to Myra storage if

226
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:53,390
you believe that you can believe the

227
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:58,670
timestamps in the sample if it is not

228
00:15:53,390 --> 00:16:02,230
edited sometimes there are reasons to

229
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:06,430
think that your way when was the first

230
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:07,990
download into virustotal it's very often

231
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:13,219
they

232
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:15,380
completion time and downloading time is

233
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:21,410
different by one or two minutes it means

234
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:26,930
that the intruder downloaded it itself

235
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:31,040
to see what happens it happens no matter

236
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:34,250
how foolish it is but and what is the

237
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:37,010
name of the intruder it may tell you

238
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:54,550
something about the language about the

239
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:57,830
purpose of the file ms-office history of

240
00:16:54,550 --> 00:17:00,099
changes and you can find it you can

241
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:03,200
delete it

242
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:08,420
last year it was surprised I didn't know

243
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:17,540
that that inside in new formats of dog X

244
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:20,270
and Excel X the printing properties are

245
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:23,780
stored and we investigated attacks

246
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:30,650
against Samsung service center in Russia

247
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:33,200
and exploit was based on dog X this IP

248
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:38,650
address as you can see is inside the

249
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:41,210
organization few people can use these

250
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:43,790
addresses in the home network be

251
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:46,190
attentive because we attentively analyze

252
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:50,210
the samples and realize that they

253
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:55,460
intruded took legal documents of some

254
00:17:50,210 --> 00:18:00,050
song and built his exploit there so he

255
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:02,240
could such documents from somewhere and

256
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:04,720
the documents belong really to the

257
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:09,470
organization not though they intruder

258
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:11,500
when you search the domain servers

259
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:17,450
X

260
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:20,660
so there was person next set and someone

261
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:24,320
asked me the colleagues asked me to find

262
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:29,090
him his famous he is well known for

263
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:32,679
organizing Satori but net on Mira with

264
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:37,730
miracle and he used the command center

265
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:42,470
but to see next solution dotnet I got

266
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:47,840
there look who is it was closed I looked

267
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:51,140
the history of who is there was email

268
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:56,030
and everything I tried to search by

269
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:59,900
email by username name surname of the

270
00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:05,090
registrant found nothing and sometime

271
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:09,290
later I read other investigations they

272
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:12,830
say try to search by phone number and

273
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:16,940
you will get another site such as dress

274
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:20,840
not net and there the person used his

275
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:24,590
true address name and surname that was

276
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:27,590
his fault he fisted similar a similar

277
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:31,370
domain when I read I said well why

278
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:34,399
didn't I find anything I went to the

279
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:38,209
main tools and found that you cannot

280
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:41,870
search by phone number through a web

281
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:47,210
interface there is no such function you

282
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:51,110
have to use IP or transformer from the

283
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:54,130
main tools they make it possible for you

284
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:58,610
to look through every field so try to

285
00:19:54,130 --> 00:20:02,930
search by all fields that automation

286
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:05,510
will help you issue number solution and

287
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:10,790
one more thing when you analyze who is

288
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:13,460
reverse history watch the expiration

289
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:17,909
time of the domain it may so happen that

290
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:20,820
the domain was registered it wasn't used

291
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:23,760
and the registration was removed in a

292
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:27,000
year and then it was registered once

293
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,670
again if you get the earliest - the

294
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,780
earliest who is you'll get the email the

295
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:37,770
real people but they may be different

296
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:42,990
people from those who registered look at

297
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:48,090
the expiration dates the text I believe

298
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:50,190
it's under estimated component of

299
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:56,340
malware there is a case with upon a

300
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:59,610
crime one a crime more about 20 or and

301
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:02,850
some nodes and the investigators not as

302
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:06,120
other people but I like them they

303
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:09,209
analyzed with Google Translator

304
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,610
what was translated from which language

305
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:14,070
to which language let's try to translate

306
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:17,969
and see what happens and if you

307
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:22,070
translate from Chinese you'll get almost

308
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:26,700
the same and if you translate to Chinese

309
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:30,840
there is something wrong so the initial

310
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:34,590
text was written in Chinese and then

311
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:40,949
translated to all other languages this

312
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:45,360
is another tool to disclose the origins

313
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:49,050
this is the method we are developing now

314
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:55,110
I live abroad and they use two languages

315
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:58,950
in my work if you have a jabber lock

316
00:21:55,110 --> 00:22:02,840
where people write and correct the

317
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:08,820
errors you can analyze the frequency of

318
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:15,510
misprints if you know the Russian

319
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:19,950
keyboard e8e are the painful symbols if

320
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:23,340
you printed in Russian then switch to

321
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:27,210
English keyboard so you will have a lot

322
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:29,189
of miss prints in these 3:04 actually

323
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:38,070
there are four such key

324
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:43,659
what else and about Google Translator

325
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:49,899
one of the proofs of Russian involvement

326
00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:54,370
in hacking in one reports there there

327
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:58,960
was an IP address from which everything

328
00:22:54,370 --> 00:23:05,189
was translated into English and in less

329
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:10,080
than an hour it was in google translator

330
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:19,120
Google allows you to edit your settings

331
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:21,270
and look what was written but you can

332
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:27,090
delete it but not in Google Translate

333
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:31,150
everything that you try to translate his

334
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:33,668
stores I didn't find it in my history of

335
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:35,710
Google and I couldn't delete everything

336
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:39,789
that is done in Google Translate is

337
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:43,510
stored and it cannot be deleted and if

338
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:47,710
you want to find a an attacker so you

339
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:53,950
can use appropriate locks then false

340
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:58,450
flags hackers know everything I said at

341
00:23:53,950 --> 00:24:05,980
least some of them all custom fields can

342
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:08,770
be falsified and you can see sometimes I

343
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:15,690
had a case of false

344
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:18,639
rich header everything can be faked

345
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:21,880
everything can be falsified please check

346
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:27,990
and recheck two stories of false flags

347
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:35,190
in our from our practice first last year

348
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:38,710
in one of the builds we found strange

349
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:41,650
Ukrainian phone number we googled it and

350
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:46,240
found the French in the forum where

351
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:50,440
people complained about a hacker who

352
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:58,860
collected the money from malware people

353
00:24:50,440 --> 00:25:02,080
to treat sick children they said well

354
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:05,070
malware is all right but children oh

355
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:21,189
that was a bad thing to do everything

356
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:23,730
everybody was angry and his Kiwi was

357
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:23,730
published

358
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:32,560
we analyzed Monsoon company and they use

359
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:37,600
exploits of Microsoft Office on your

360
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:40,090
left you can see a screenshot you can

361
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:46,230
see that just food dot became the main

362
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:54,360
is use we analyzed it for a long time

363
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:54,360
and there was the face from screenshot

364
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:07,900
we googled the root destroyer and we

365
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:12,470
found Facebook profile where we had

366
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:18,730
pictures of an Indian student and he

367
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:22,940
calls himself root destroy looked at the

368
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:26,390
site where they fixed their deeds

369
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:31,160
ready faces and those Indian cyber

370
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:35,210
gangsters he faced against Pakistani

371
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:39,290
site because of India Pakistan frictions

372
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:41,950
tensions there was a just food okay web

373
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:46,370
server it was vulnerable and two groups

374
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:51,500
found the vulnerability and one of the

375
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:54,620
groups downloaded a pilot for exploits

376
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:59,980
the other defaced it it may happen and

377
00:26:54,620 --> 00:27:07,419
if you do attribution

378
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:10,430
you can blame something for India but

379
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:15,440
actually it was not in yet was done by

380
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:18,710
Chinese dissidents so we reached the

381
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,690
real investigation area I want to

382
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:24,590
demonstrate it in full

383
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:27,680
I have never published it just look it

384
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:33,530
in dynamics how to search data about a

385
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:36,050
person how to prove our he cases and if

386
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:40,129
there are several people who are

387
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:42,639
suspected who is the hacker or the

388
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:42,640
greatest

389
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:52,889
natural abilities so posts terminals in

390
00:27:49,889 --> 00:27:56,279
several countries in several trade

391
00:27:52,889 --> 00:28:00,539
networks malware was found how did it

392
00:27:56,279 --> 00:28:02,429
get there it is yet to be disclosed when

393
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:05,519
we bought the samples and look at the

394
00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:13,259
similar samples we found a sample with

395
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:16,529
this path to debug files of course it

396
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:18,379
was compiled in Visual Studio and it

397
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:22,259
doesn't tell us anything there is no

398
00:28:18,379 --> 00:28:24,389
username but there is a source and word

399
00:28:22,259 --> 00:28:30,179
when we download the Susa

400
00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:31,350
it's a Romanian for source so we got a

401
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:37,889
clue

402
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:42,600
a Romanian trace one more thread was the

403
00:28:37,889 --> 00:28:47,340
buter when we try to use the mutex we

404
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:50,189
found the post at malware forum where a

405
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:54,889
person's discussed this mutex and if you

406
00:28:50,190 --> 00:29:00,149
look at the code there is a message box

407
00:28:54,889 --> 00:29:03,658
in for debugging we found the debug

408
00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:08,039
sample where this message box was also

409
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:11,220
used a bit different slightly edited but

410
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:15,000
everything is around the same curves so

411
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:19,200
we try to look closer at this person

412
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:22,350
watch other posts and other forums that

413
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:26,360
person who posted other parts of the

414
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:30,600
same code including this screenshot

415
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:34,008
screenshot is interesting because we

416
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:40,020
could away download the page and look

417
00:29:34,009 --> 00:29:43,630
here it is first of all I cannot

418
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:49,360
zoom it you can see a battery here it's

419
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:52,720
a notebook on top you can see the name

420
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:56,860
of the folder the perfect tool and I

421
00:29:52,720 --> 00:30:05,260
remind you of the fact sorry yes it

422
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:09,879
works here the hook was used the perfect

423
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:15,010
hook was used there hotels is

424
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:20,350
interesting position resolution of the

425
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:24,190
file was five hundred two hundred fifty

426
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:27,459
sixty one thousand six hundred and

427
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:31,660
rating there are very few notebooks with

428
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:34,120
this resolution Mac Pro with one of

429
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:36,490
several servers and only one for Windows

430
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:43,600
if you look at the screenshot you can

431
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:46,780
see the network folder PSF PSF share

432
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:51,459
will be SF the first link in the Google

433
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:54,399
was forum parallels we understood this

434
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:56,890
is virtualization under Mac you have

435
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:59,980
Windows 7 installed with Visual Studio

436
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:06,550
and he compiles it and he gets some

437
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:10,240
mistakes also it's interesting to pay

438
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:12,550
attention to the time on this you see

439
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:16,840
the time of publication minute by minute

440
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:18,610
it's very close so the person has made a

441
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:23,260
screenshot through the post and of the

442
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:26,439
post rip in Italy but the hours the

443
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:31,410
clock shows different time

444
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:40,360
what you see you to seem possible zero

445
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:42,940
delay to UTSA minus seven which means he

446
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:48,370
is on the Pacific coast of the United

447
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:50,830
States he knows what we can get from one

448
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:52,750
screenshot we can get resolution

449
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:58,510
understand it it's a laptop that is

450
00:31:52,750 --> 00:32:07,530
virtualized from my book the name of the

451
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:12,550
project and the time zone his profile

452
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:14,379
says that he lives in Las Vegas pay

453
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:16,570
attention to this user it's actually

454
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:19,900
moral you go to tales you're not really

455
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:23,230
I can tell everything

456
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:32,400
so we also found him on night Javadoc

457
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:42,030
yellow cards with Jemma machines tonight

458
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:45,780
that you can use if you have enough

459
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:49,450
information you can duplicate the card

460
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:52,620
and what the original never agreed that

461
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:55,560
was gathering the dumps of credit cards

462
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:59,860
gathering the pin code

463
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:01,929
keystrokes and sending to and sent it to

464
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:05,530
its owner and that's why it was called

465
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:08,410
phosphorus so we found the posts on this

466
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:12,639
forum and understood we are moving in

467
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:16,450
the right direction understanding we

468
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:19,960
have cards and in both cases and also we

469
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:22,540
found his was on the Russian according

470
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:25,600
forum with the same nickname and he was

471
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:28,389
writing in English why did we think his

472
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:31,570
Romanian because

473
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:35,170
a Russian forum he was writing in

474
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:38,550
English obviously Moldova citizen would

475
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:43,120
know Russian language quite well too

476
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:46,780
speaking in Russian then we found this

477
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:54,610
thing and this team profile with the

478
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:57,910
same we also found sheet reactor

479
00:33:54,610 --> 00:34:02,500
rhetoric forces where he was discussing

480
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:05,920
some injects into processes we couldn't

481
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:08,050
understand whether what it has something

482
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:12,760
to do with the case but it is his

483
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:16,120
nickname tired of cheaters says that he

484
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:18,250
is tired final for cheating integers so

485
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:20,730
he is nine games in the profile but the

486
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:26,380
real breakthrough was when we went here

487
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:29,800
PC part speaker side that helps you

488
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:31,870
build your PC and he has a lot of

489
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:34,720
activity there he was choosing the new

490
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:38,199
configuration but his musi and he said

491
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:42,069
money is not an issue tell me the best

492
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:42,969
configuration I'd like to develop and to

493
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:45,460
play games

494
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:51,239
we compared the games to the ones that

495
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:54,418
you mentioned he has all those games and

496
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:57,580
it is profile and he also wrote that he

497
00:34:54,418 --> 00:35:01,509
develop slaughter his MacBook as my draw

498
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:04,799
and he was not satisfied with the phones

499
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:09,250
he bought the top built top motherboard

500
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:12,130
then 18 by the time 4k monitor top

501
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:18,580
processor and the phones were not

502
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:22,330
beautiful he was complaining about

503
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:26,890
being not able to develop on the visual

504
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:29,440
studio in own windows because the forms

505
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:34,600
were still terrible and he was also

506
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:36,130
mentioned his TV compared this all and

507
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:39,089
understood that's our client

508
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:43,930
[Music]

509
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:46,270
breakthrough he said he is not satisfied

510
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:51,040
with not only the phones but also with a

511
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:55,740
noise from the fans and of course he got

512
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:57,790
the best cooler that will cool his

513
00:35:55,740 --> 00:36:00,580
overclocked ji7

514
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:02,890
and of course the crew was too loud and

515
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:11,590
he was complaining about the noisy

516
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:17,529
cooler we have few his video he has

517
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:22,660
uploaded and we also saw that the

518
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:25,480
profile was called Alexandro aliens will

519
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:28,420
be Google's that name we understood it's

520
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:32,140
all devon football player name they have

521
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:34,140
four videos to private and to public we

522
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:35,230
watched this second public media

523
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:42,190
[Music]

524
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:45,490
there was smart phone video of the 4k TV

525
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:49,090
all three Albania Romanian football

526
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:51,399
nation where the guy got the yellow the

527
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:55,380
red card right in the end of the of the

528
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,380
game and it was you

529
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,509
[Music]

530
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:37,069
you have private sharing there was a

531
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:40,880
chance that he was just googled I just

532
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:44,690
shared it but there's a site called

533
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:46,640
YouTube native viewer and you can use it

534
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:52,030
to understand when the video was posted

535
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:55,430
and we decided and career posting video

536
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:58,460
hosting time with the video posting time

537
00:37:55,430 --> 00:38:03,319
and understood you know that computer

538
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:05,420
has passed three hours and effectively

539
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:10,070
found out that the difference in time

540
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:12,650
between the upload to YouTube and the

541
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:19,820
post is like 3 min which so obviously

542
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:24,890
it's him just uploaded so remembering

543
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:30,440
our first first idea of using the

544
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:37,670
Romanian word confirms and his profile

545
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:39,770
also had a link to Google Falls but that

546
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:44,530
had no information but when I googled

547
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:49,090
his Google ID google gave me linked maps

548
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:49,090
that contains public

549
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:56,240
public comments that he was given in Los

550
00:38:53,630 --> 00:39:00,820
Angeles around Hollywood Hills it's in

551
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,819
all five of his comments on Google Maps

552
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:09,470
I just bought my G Lexus SUV and I

553
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:13,160
highly recommend the dealership center

554
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:19,220
that sold it to me second one was review

555
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:27,020
of wood repair shops where he says he

556
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:29,480
was fixing his BMW sex next one is clear

557
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:35,120
clinic where he was blood test there was

558
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:37,180
five comments explaining a lot of his

559
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:40,910
lifestyle and I understood we have

560
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:45,649
enough information to make an arrest

561
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:47,600
just a matter of technicalities you know

562
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:50,180
he's in Los Angeles you know he's a

563
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:52,940
client of the cleaning he his steam

564
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:57,790
profile probably paid for it from his

565
00:39:52,940 --> 00:40:01,610
real credit card understood it's time to

566
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:04,360
send a report to Interpol to tell you

567
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:07,880
about how it happens I will put the end

568
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:14,750
of the story to the end of the

569
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:17,090
presentation so it's dessert but

570
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:20,240
retaining Interpol first of all you need

571
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:22,160
to back up everything you have so

572
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:35,930
download the video from YouTube

573
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:37,970
screenshots France France can block it

574
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:42,359
and Singapore researchers will not be

575
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:45,870
able to get access to those posts

576
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:49,530
it's um it's probably actually so

577
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:53,190
everything is screen shot downloaded you

578
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:55,620
write a very detailed report my one was

579
00:40:53,190 --> 00:41:01,830
27 pages long it had a lot of

580
00:40:55,620 --> 00:41:05,359
screenshots with a connection to

581
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:09,960
Interpol nothing special they have

582
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:13,080
special mailbox with a special

583
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:15,540
encryption key and you use it to in

584
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:19,160
creeped after you send it after some

585
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:21,990
time if they say we want to meet you

586
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:27,830
when you find a meeting you come to the

587
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:27,830
meeting now my clicker is not working

588
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:39,170
yeah ok it's just like I don't see the

589
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:43,790
next slide slide here is the scheme from

590
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:49,610
the report for my for the Interpol

591
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:54,870
people my logical scheme made in Malta

592
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:58,050
to understand how after you are invited

593
00:41:54,870 --> 00:42:01,680
you come to beautiful cyber fusion

594
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:09,270
center it's the security there is very

595
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:12,000
good spikes in the concrete that prevent

596
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:15,390
from you know what you're driving on in

597
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,510
in a car and exploding this soul then

598
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:21,930
there's an operative worker just second

599
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:25,140
line is cutting your hands your backpack

600
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:27,120
everything you come into some capsule

601
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:32,700
that measures your weight

602
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:35,490
I thought they want you to understand

603
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:38,759
the difference but later and so they

604
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:40,680
gave me coffee and I know ask me to the

605
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:45,560
toilet so it's interesting why how would

606
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:48,569
they account for that but anyways so the

607
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:52,350
person in Interpol who was reading this

608
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:53,880
report asks you a question and the most

609
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:57,810
popular question they asked

610
00:42:53,880 --> 00:43:02,240
why is it important there isn't here is

611
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:08,549
that he has to write his own report and

612
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:11,129
to avoid this work he tries to delegate

613
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:12,780
a little bit of this work to you asking

614
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:16,140
why is it important

615
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:21,600
will there be new victims other invictus

616
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:23,670
and my jurisdiction and all the all the

617
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:32,250
questions to confirm that he really has

618
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:34,980
to do with some damage his jurisdiction

619
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:38,340
so it's interesting and we answered a

620
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:42,350
lot of questions what is the potential

621
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:47,430
damage monetary amount and then the

622
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:55,380
Interpol worker writes his own report

623
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:59,759
and I know he said to his superiors

624
00:43:55,380 --> 00:44:03,630
where the Ministry of Interior does

625
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:06,930
instrument unfortunately local

626
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:11,700
investigators or Interpol do not have

627
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:16,379
any report so they don't track they can

628
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:19,799
ask the local authorities but usually

629
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:23,520
they know I think they can not even they

630
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:27,390
can even stay without reply but they

631
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:28,380
cannot push the investigation so you

632
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:32,100
wait and wait

633
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:34,550
you keep getting notifications from

634
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,549
virustotal

635
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:42,840
about the new samples compiled and

636
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:45,480
loaded they comply to your euro generals

637
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:48,260
so you understand the person is still

638
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,260
there

639
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:57,100
and sometimes you ask a question of

640
00:44:54,910 --> 00:45:00,690
what's happening with my report and they

641
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:02,890
keep saying up yeah we have no reply

642
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:06,130
nothing we don't need to know anything

643
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:08,069
but sometimes it happens the other way

644
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:10,650
around

645
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:15,460
should you know what this lady

646
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:17,230
industries as a finals we had a press

647
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:20,050
release from the Ministry of Justice

648
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:23,290
from the United States about their

649
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:28,330
convictions to the group of 36 people

650
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:32,440
mostly Ukrainian some other people did

651
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:36,790
you know the stuff I Italian Egyptians

652
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:40,720
so they were doing doing carding they

653
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:44,259
were stealing the cards they had special

654
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:47,109

659
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:08,890
group was not able to they were not able

660
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:13,390
to identify but let me introduce some

661
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:15,970
that were identified valerian

662
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:20,529
shoo-shoo flown from Moldova 28 years

663
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:24,370
old I just found it because I googled of

664
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:27,340
course no one has ever sent anything to

665
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:31,859
me or posted me about the investigation

666
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:35,740
proceeding so if you count on Fame and

667
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:39,340
fanfare probably that's the wrong way to

668
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:41,500
go and I'm not sure you will succeed in

669
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:44,170
getting anything from Interpol and of

670
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:48,930
course neither my company fortunate or

671
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:48,930
of me myself were mentioned

672
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:57,890
are they just a reference to the to the

673
00:46:53,660 --> 00:47:01,310
occasion in cyber networks probably they

674
00:46:57,890 --> 00:47:03,740
stay in cyber fusion centers this way so

675
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:07,549
it means that we security analysts from

676
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:12,350
vendors we just have troubled dark

677
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:17,330
destiny of going here they're living in

678
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:21,970
5-star hotels without framing so I told

679
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:24,950
you about the identifying of criminals

680
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:28,870
Interpol collaboration give you an

681
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:31,819
example of a real real convictions of

682
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:36,290
course are still going on so he's the

683
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:39,500
person is still not not proven to be

684
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:43,070
criminal if you read this small script

685
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:46,750
and the real damage is four hundred

686
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:50,060
thirty million dollars the intent was

687
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:52,850
around 2.2 billion dollars but this

688
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:57,080
needs to be proved during court

689
00:47:52,850 --> 00:48:01,160
proceedings so I will be happy to answer

690
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:04,910
your questions and I'm empowered to give

691
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:10,100
you t-shirts as gifts so don't start to

692
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:18,560
ask questions before you have a mic so

693
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:22,250
that everyone listens and you talked

694
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:27,799
about heuristic old records and question

695
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:33,650
is when you use virustotal with cierto

696
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:35,780
SSDI and other things give us some more

697
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:38,920
cases on how you can use those heuristic

698
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:41,630
on modules IG gives you such files

699
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:44,260
probably again I don't think I'm a big

700
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:44,260
specialist

701
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:51,970
this is my hobby this is something I

702
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:58,630
learned and I had meat we have such

703
00:48:51,970 --> 00:49:02,859
technologies rules and stuff are drawing

704
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:06,280
new things appearing we have API that

705
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:09,130
you can call it's being developed so you

706
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:12,820
have interesting options like you know

707
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:16,950
file names during uploads changes that

708
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:19,060
you track and monitor and it's part of

709
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:23,520
the answer to your question

710
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:27,190
unfortunately I'm not ready to give you

711
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:29,200
systematic details because there's a lot

712
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:32,860
of information on the internet on gerra

713
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:37,089
rules but that's not what I am expert in

714
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:41,070
and a lot of changes is coming so yeah

715
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:41,070
definitely there's a lot of father stuff

716
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:52,990
ga3 technology tree technology in your

717
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:55,060
investigations and if there's any use

718
00:49:52,990 --> 00:50:00,580
yeah I will google it sorry I have no

719
00:49:55,060 --> 00:50:04,240
idea I think my hope was that I will get

720
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:08,830
new ideas from you and obviously that's

721
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:10,209
one of them the question actually two

722
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:12,880
questions do you have any experience

723
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:16,630
working with the Russian authorities in

724
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:20,470
this direction and second are there any

725
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:22,780
databases for the Interpol that you use

726
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:26,859
so you said you use virustotal and

727
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:30,580
Google or other any databases that

728
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:34,750
belong to Interpol where you can search

729
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:37,029
thank you the answer thank you yeah I

730
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:38,800
don't have any experience working with

731
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:42,130
Russian authorities but there's nothing

732
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:45,430
impossible so if C does not belong to

733
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:48,450
any country and we have a practice I

734
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:52,270
think there's practice so CFC he was

735
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:54,990
changing after some interval so there's

736
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:58,200
no practice of CFC belonging and you

737
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:59,640
they work on a contract and then moved

738
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:02,700
in other countries they are from

739
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:06,569
different countries I never met any

740
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:10,410
Russians there and but even we have

741
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:15,510
experts from our companies and whispers

742
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:21,020
collab working constantly in helping us

743
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:24,870
consultants you got in Hell where they

744
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:28,320
have the sources to create and aware of

745
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:30,630
this level I have no idea about Interpol

746
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:34,640
databases probably they have some

747
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:39,870
internal infrastructure that they use

748
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:42,299
but they don't disclose it so they give

749
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:46,859
me tasks from the outside and I can

750
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:49,470
bring some results to them but I cannot

751
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:52,290
disclose anything even if I know but in

752
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:54,209
reality here I just don't think they

753
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:58,500
have they have them like sample

754
00:51:54,210 --> 00:52:04,130
libraries and obviously some statistics

755
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:10,070
full and some data for the actors that

756
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:12,690
they follow but I never really

757
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:17,070
questioned thank you very much

758
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:19,590
interesting questions about life so if

759
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:23,220
there was a guy you know what Alexis was

760
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:27,960
driving BMW going to can you spoil his

761
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:31,020
beautiful life I think you did it just

762
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:33,840
to talk about this on page D or you

763
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:35,880
wanna did your company guarantee use

764
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:39,240
from this like what was the the

765
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:41,010
positiveness probably your company has

766
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:43,890
spent an Interpol has spent a lot of

767
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:47,610
money on this investigation oh yeah

768
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:53,310
you're right answer we are getting good

769
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:56,160
salary something company has budget they

770
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:58,609
spend it on me so that I do

771
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:05,410
investigations during mine

772
00:52:58,609 --> 00:53:05,410
working time to mana fits first practice

773
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:13,880
practice understanding of the threats if

774
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:16,549
you were virus analyst you would you

775
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:18,079
have no he will have found a lot of new

776
00:53:16,549 --> 00:53:22,210
signatures that's good

777
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:27,349
second is PR so Publishing's with

778
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:29,690
Interpol publications from Interpol the

779
00:53:27,349 --> 00:53:32,420
coverage of all the audience and

780
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:36,999
investigations quality is very high so

781
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:40,039
that's positioning ourselves as experts

782
00:53:36,999 --> 00:53:42,859
so any work with Interpol that you do is

783
00:53:40,039 --> 00:53:47,450
very good positioning as experts even

784
00:53:42,859 --> 00:53:51,890
this space thank you

785
00:53:47,450 --> 00:53:53,779
question before this was submitted to

786
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:56,150
Interpol between this missionary

787
00:53:53,779 --> 00:53:58,059
Interpol and invitation to you do an

788
00:53:56,150 --> 00:54:01,970
interview how much time has passed

789
00:53:58,059 --> 00:54:04,730
answer well roughly I gave it this week

790
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:08,660
Wednesday and next week Thursday I got

791
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:10,609
an invitation I had a letter asking me

792
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:14,239
about the time that is convenient for me

793
00:54:10,609 --> 00:54:15,710
to come and we agreed on the time and

794
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:20,650
when was the person arrested

795
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:25,640
oh that took a lot of time so the report

796
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:28,430
will not mention specific dates but the

797
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:30,200
report was summer 2017 and the

798
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:33,710
conviction was published by the Ministry

799
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:41,660
of Justice and February 2018 so roughly

800
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:44,150
in a year they date the agents actually

801
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:47,710
had to buy the cards from the people on

802
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:47,710
the forum and we're trying to also

803
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:54,288
increase the scope of the investigation

804
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:56,930
so it's not my fame to find this

805
00:54:54,289 --> 00:54:59,329
beautiful group I just contributed to

806
00:54:56,930 --> 00:55:02,410
identifying one of the members of the

807
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:05,349
group and that's why they were

808
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:09,339
interested in working with them and so

809
00:55:05,349 --> 00:55:13,720
the report was Papa's given in early

810
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:16,270
spring but in August the investigators

811
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:18,490
were trying to purchase something from

812
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:22,590
the forms so you can imagine they there

813
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:22,589
was a lot of time passing between

814
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:30,520
between those two ends in March or May

815
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:34,359
the person has deleted the video from

816
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:39,180
YouTube so he felt someone is interested

817
00:55:34,359 --> 00:55:39,180
in him or something has happened and

818
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:50,220
with a simple authentication the last

819
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:53,980
sample of Education with my arrows was

820
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:56,859
us about that time frame so I'm not

821
00:55:53,980 --> 00:56:01,150
working fast the dream of them you know

822
00:55:56,859 --> 00:56:05,680
like opening doors with their legs and

823
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:08,080
arresting everyone getting fingerprints

824
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:10,710
and memory dumps from the hard drives

825
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:13,690
but in reality I understand they have to

826
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:15,940
start the proceedings the investigator

827
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:18,820
cannot start the proceedings himself he

828
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:21,609
needs sanj sanctions from the prosecutor

829
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:25,210
prosecutor means some information so

830
00:56:21,609 --> 00:56:27,759
there's legal legal stuff happening that

831
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:30,010
that takes a lot of time it depends on

832
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:34,720
the country of course in many cases they

833
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:40,330
just don't you know they don't care well

834
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:45,580
the question the person whose life was

835
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:49,480
spoiled and sir I I can tell you it

836
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:52,450
after the presentation not publicly but

837
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:54,160
my ADEA is you need to put those people

838
00:56:52,450 --> 00:57:01,149
to prison

839
00:56:54,160 --> 00:57:06,180
next question you said he posted the

840
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:08,609
report to Interpol but does the victim

841
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:14,440
participate in the investigation

842
00:57:08,609 --> 00:57:17,078
answer yes in this case the victims were

843
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:20,950
numerous so it was the United States

844
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:24,940
Italy some other countries and I don't

845
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:27,730
remember exactly how they were setting

846
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:34,500
up their post terminals maybe we have it

847
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:37,690
in conclusion part so the result was

848
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:41,220
malware sample right yes it was not a

849
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:48,400
complaint from a vendor that was the

850
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:50,348
start of the investigation happens that

851
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:54,250
you'd come to the investigation place to

852
00:57:50,349 --> 00:57:55,630
some forensics but in this case we

853
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:58,869
participated in the investigation

854
00:57:55,630 --> 00:58:00,579
without having anything to do with the

855
00:57:58,869 --> 00:58:02,710
investigation itself we just had a

856
00:58:00,579 --> 00:58:07,740
sample found the person wrote an article

857
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:07,740
and presented on a conference that's it

858
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:19,859
question you talked about the false he

859
00:58:15,339 --> 00:58:24,730
talks about false flags the topic

860
00:58:19,859 --> 00:58:27,369
disappeared vectors have I think

861
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:32,039
disappeared here they know how how the

862
00:58:27,369 --> 00:58:35,160
attacks can be attributed so what to do

863
00:58:32,039 --> 00:58:41,200
with those false flags when you know

864
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:47,348
they are there if you do everything you

865
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:49,589
know the ideal manner you do you will

866
00:58:47,349 --> 00:58:52,770
not find anything in the country

867
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:58,250
so if you do everything right it's

868
00:58:52,770 --> 00:59:00,540
really really tough to dig out something

869
00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:03,540
there's a lot of investigations where I

870
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:07,980
could not find anything the person is

871
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:11,990
arrested by Locke and the source code of

872
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:16,380
the other middleware and detects yes

873
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:20,729
otherwise if are they false flags trade

874
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:25,400
works fine it works yeah people use

875
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:31,080
nicknames multiple times using mutex

876
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:33,900
username multiple times yeah it has

877
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:37,020
created a case for five hundred million

878
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:39,120
dollar damage but if everything is done

879
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:41,070
correctly yeah you can fool the

880
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:43,109
investigator you can fold the researcher

881
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:48,210
and no one will find your traces this is

882
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:52,830
true no magic bullet no magic tool to

883
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:59,820
actually fix it last question question

884
00:59:52,830 --> 01:00:03,270
what is tools for domain analytics for

885
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:05,970
the main IP analytics to attribute them

886
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:08,790
to the malware answer it will have an

887
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:12,330
internal database with domain names we

888
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:16,560
use it you know the two I like most

889
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:19,940
domain tools there's the person called

890
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:23,520
craps it gets money from them i

891
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:27,420
advertised onion for free malta also has

892
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:35,670
a plugging this malta is a craft

893
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:37,740
building put a dome in there and they

894
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:40,620
reverse the Whois service and I'll take

895
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:43,500
a bill to a graph of saying this email

896
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:48,000
has a number of domains registered under

897
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:50,760
it and those domains have all the emails

898
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:54,200
and you have a huge graph of connections

899
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:54,200
it looks like police

900
01:00:55,620 --> 01:01:03,040
with a lot of boys we have trees this is

901
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:05,980
all great so this is my weapon of choice

902
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:12,490
and my tool that I like and this is what

903
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:15,340
this is all the time we have and I need

904
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:20,220
to choose a person to give prices so the

905
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:25,570
person asked me about the new tool I

906
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:29,169
would like to reward him for this ok

907
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:31,420
would you like white wine and the second

908
01:01:29,170 --> 01:01:39,100
question was about the profit very good
