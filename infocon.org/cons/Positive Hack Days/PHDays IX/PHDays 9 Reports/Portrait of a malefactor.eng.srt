1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,960
thanks everybody for coming on day two

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:10,170
at ten o'clock well for me personally

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:15,809
that was a challenge to be here for ten

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:21,380
o'clock on day two let's talk about the

5
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:25,320
portrait of khyber cyber lawlessness

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,490
let's discuss who are the attackers why

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,820
they attack what are their motivations

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:35,040
what incidents are more numerous what

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:39,410
are the trends who performs attacks and

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:43,350
why they do so I would like to discuss

11
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:47,398
not only the I like to focus on the

12
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:50,879
Russian cyberspace of course we are also

13
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:53,489
interested in the global statistics but

14
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,730
would also like to know what's happening

15
00:00:53,489 --> 00:01:01,190
here at home in Russia especially given

16
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:06,060
the fact that if we look at foreign

17
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:08,369
statistics at foreign hand lines we read

18
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,530
very often that some strange Russian

19
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:13,860
hackers constantly attacked people

20
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:16,460
abroad in the West but in fact or what's

21
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:22,830
happening here in Russia is kind of

22
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:30,798
challenging to understand so ok let me

23
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:30,798
introduce the panelists which tried to

24
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:35,430
gather here experts from different

25
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,549
quarters

26
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:42,990
Sergey a glove enough of the Kaspersky

27
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:47,790
Lab Bible Kuznetsov of the Central Bank

28
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:53,199
of Russia and Rubin mgs and antonio deck

29
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:59,259
of rose to the consoler and rosetone

30
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:05,020
of Group IB and I represent as a

31
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:07,810
positive technologist company we have

32
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,910
agreed that attackers can be roughly

33
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:14,110
broken down into three categories and

34
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:15,910
those who are dead hunters those are who

35
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:22,000
are monetarily who are financially

36
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:25,150
motivated spies and lastly activists

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,299
those guys who want to kind of assert

38
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:31,239
themselves and make themselves known so

39
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:38,290
here my question for the panelists is

40
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:39,959
this how can you assess what do you

41
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:42,880
think about the motivation of the

42
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,700
attackers that attack the perform their

43
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,940
attacks within the russian territory in

44
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:53,589
other words what's the distribution but

45
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:56,799
of over these three groups you know what

46
00:02:53,590 --> 00:03:01,510
was the share of hacktivists financially

47
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:04,170
motivated attackers and data hunters who

48
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,170
wants to start

49
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:11,209
all right we're not gonna draw what's

50
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:19,309
was gonna go first

51
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:37,730
good morning everybody okay speaking

52
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:45,200
about the statistics speaking about the

53
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:48,250
motivation of the attackers well 90% of

54
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:53,089
the attackers and financially motivated

55
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:55,669
spies and thieves are about 10% and

56
00:03:53,090 --> 00:04:00,939
hacktivists or about 10% or more than

57
00:03:55,669 --> 00:04:00,939
that did I answer your question yes

58
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:13,159
good morning our statistic is our

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,250
statistics is limited by the industry

60
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:17,930
where we work well because we at the

61
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:20,298
Central Bank of Russia we monitor the

62
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:22,310
financial sector the financial and

63
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:23,650
credit and the written distribution of

64
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:26,680
these attention is more or less the same

65
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:29,060
most attackers are financially motivated

66
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:35,120
they want to get money for their attacks

67
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:37,639
or get some Branson and in fact there

68
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,320
hasn't been a lot of change in the

69
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:44,660
number of in the well in the sheer of

70
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:47,719
relative share of those detectors over

71
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,940
the past year we believe the

72
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,210
distribution is as follows

73
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:58,580
70% of the attackers are financially

74
00:04:53,210 --> 00:05:01,729
motivated they try to hack financial

75
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:06,948
systems they create viruses brain

76
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:13,340
somewhere about 25 percent are all sorts

77
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:17,750
of spyware spyware traders and less than

78
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:24,909
5% are activists it's very difficult to

79
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:29,180
call activism let me give you an example

80
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:33,800
when a person makes public threats and

81
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:37,070
begins to dump internal documents of an

82
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,990
organization well down the line or the

83
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:41,680
at the end of the day what the notice

84
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:46,990
hacktivist quote-unquote wants is to

85
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:50,180
just get money to stop these leaks I

86
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:55,300
would agree with my colleagues to the

87
00:05:50,180 --> 00:06:00,710
effect that the lion's share of hacks

88
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:02,870
occur or a motivated financially but

89
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:06,380
regarding the distribution or they break

90
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:07,999
down of what is Hector ISM or not

91
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:11,269
activism

92
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:16,519
I wouldn't draw a clear line between

93
00:06:11,269 --> 00:06:21,819
these two because if we find spyware we

94
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:26,389
cannot say for sure that this is cybers

95
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:31,269
espionage or hacktivism only based on

96
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:33,949
the fact that we have identified spyware

97
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:36,949
perhaps when we have more information

98
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:41,689
about a whole range of such spyware we

99
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:44,389
can kind of classify them but while

100
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:48,379
we're catching an attack if we are

101
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:52,029
tasked with classifying it whether it's

102
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:55,729
a cyber espionage activism or

103
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:59,209
financially financial motivated have to

104
00:06:55,729 --> 00:07:01,029
ISM our hacker activities it's very hard

105
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:05,419
to make a difference between them I

106
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:08,569
wouldn't fix a too much on how to make a

107
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:10,698
difference or the distribution what's

108
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:15,219
the difference ablution like is it 20

109
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:20,539
percent was it 25 percent for activism

110
00:07:15,219 --> 00:07:23,959
Massiah espionage I would say 50 50 with

111
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:27,128
a very unclear and flexible boundary

112
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:32,239
between these classes of hacks

113
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:35,989
speaking of motivation and division into

114
00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:41,029
these groups I'd say that the majority

115
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:44,828
of attacks won't pursue some financial

116
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:52,389
gains I'd say that it's over 90% but I

117
00:07:44,829 --> 00:07:52,389
would add that

118
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:05,900
I would add that we need to look at the

119
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:11,159
early targets of the assassin the early

120
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:13,590
goals especially if we are able to

121
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:17,550
prevent an attack wait we may never know

122
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:20,938
who was the attacker but if we look at a

123
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:25,259
retrospective later case if we observe

124
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:28,589
some recurrent activity of an organized

125
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:35,339
group that's another thing second of all

126
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:39,899
as the attacker the attackers may shift

127
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:44,250
their focus in some case they may act as

128
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:47,639
activists in other cases they may be

129
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:51,350
more financially motivated there are

130
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:55,019
examples out there and I believe that

131
00:08:51,350 --> 00:09:00,470
that is really true so I would repeat

132
00:08:55,019 --> 00:09:04,140
more our estimate more than 90% of

133
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:09,390
hackers are financially motivated in the

134
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:13,649
remainder perhaps less than 5% for each

135
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:17,660
of the other term groups not financially

136
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:22,050
motivated they are either cyber spies or

137
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:27,540
activists I believe that we have to

138
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:29,130
divide we should divide hackers not

139
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,939
based on motivation because motivations

140
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:35,339
can be different from case to case but

141
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:39,300
along other lines I would identify three

142
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:42,750
groups we can even go deeper and I defy

143
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:46,170
side groups they can be broke government

144
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:50,930
hackers perform combat clever combat

145
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:53,670
missions and they can be there can be

146
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:56,130
other types of hackers that only attack

147
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:58,550
physical persons or legal persons to get

148
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:01,550
financial gains and the third group

149
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:08,620
so-called activists

150
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:08,620
that well that pursue is certain cause

151
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:20,029
for example this did the Islamic cyber

152
00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:22,519
Halla fight Caliphate is a the

153
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:25,700
propaganda a certain ideas even hack

154
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:28,959
certain size to to use them as a

155
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:33,589
platform for delivering their propaganda

156
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:36,890
or Lazarus North Korean Lazarus they did

157
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:40,610
both sabotage espionage and more

158
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:46,370
recently they started to attack banks to

159
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:52,640
steal money look into cyber crime

160
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:57,490
perhaps it's common knowledge but I can

161
00:10:52,640 --> 00:11:02,899
even refer you to articles by Bloomberg

162
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:06,649
that say that cyber criminals become the

163
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:10,910
weapons of some countries that is used

164
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:16,610
to perform their hostilities not in the

165
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:20,209
physical space but in cyberspace I guess

166
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:21,110
that's it well interesting that was

167
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:26,390
interesting

168
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:31,940
I liked this attempt to divide attackers

169
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:32,930
and hackers along different points in

170
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,829
other words to use a different

171
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:38,540
classification principle so did I get

172
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:42,199
you're right that you can only identify

173
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:44,290
the kind of incidence only when you find

174
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:48,309
the attacker

175
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:53,639
and ask him/her with a question who you

176
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:59,259
are who you're working for and so on no

177
00:11:53,639 --> 00:12:03,309
look when you can attribute an attack to

178
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:09,339
a specific attacker it becomes more

179
00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:13,029
easily become easier to identify the

180
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:15,189
goals of an attacker order of attack if

181
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:16,720
you see an attack if you see a new

182
00:12:15,189 --> 00:12:19,689
instrument but you don't know who the

183
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,919
attacker is it's hard to know because at

184
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:27,939
an early stage it is impossible to tell

185
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:31,720
what the goals of a hacker group is but

186
00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:35,498
I will I guess I will expand on this

187
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:38,379
thought later as I said the motivation

188
00:12:35,499 --> 00:12:39,789
can be different we don't cases when

189
00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:43,269
there was a group that was able to

190
00:12:39,789 --> 00:12:44,769
penetrate a bank or a company and then

191
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:48,009
it doesn't know what to do with this

192
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:51,639
access and then they resell it they sell

193
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:54,970
it to someone else so in that case in

194
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:59,009
those cases we have one group of hackers

195
00:12:54,970 --> 00:13:04,059
that break security and then they sell

196
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:08,079
this access to a hacked company or

197
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:11,289
organization to a third party speaking

198
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:14,858
about a known Russian situation there

199
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:17,649
was a large company it was an incident

200
00:13:14,859 --> 00:13:20,559
that was identified they called us and

201
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:23,799
it turned out that they had had spied

202
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:29,379
the spyware for three years an instant

203
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:32,529
of human money or you know spoofing

204
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:34,809
traffic these guys were simply listening

205
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:36,730
or watching where the money went from

206
00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:40,059
where they went where they came from

207
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:43,869
where they went to so no money was

208
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:47,049
stolen over the period of three years so

209
00:13:43,869 --> 00:13:50,919
that's kind of unusual and it is

210
00:13:47,049 --> 00:13:53,858
entirely unclear it is entirely unclear

211
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:55,490
who did that who did that

212
00:13:53,859 --> 00:14:00,829
and why they did that

213
00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:02,660
well that's a very kind of slippery

214
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:07,540
slope

215
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:12,189
regarding attribution and the toolbox

216
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:15,259
but do you have a feeling that the same

217
00:14:12,189 --> 00:14:20,209
attackers use the entire toolbox that's

218
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:23,449
available on the cyber crime market it's

219
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:29,149
let me start of course we see that some

220
00:14:23,449 --> 00:14:32,029
groups use some known instruments if you

221
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:35,149
look at the example of Lazarus Lazarus

222
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:38,569
and others try to use instruments that

223
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:44,689
have been used by others or that are

224
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:47,899
available to a wide range of actors that

225
00:14:44,689 --> 00:14:51,670
really makes attribution more difficult

226
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:54,350
but sometimes these hackers make errors

227
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:57,339
perhaps these are not even errors and

228
00:14:54,350 --> 00:15:00,740
but these are just preferences for

229
00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:02,629
preferences for holsters so based on

230
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:04,839
that information based on these errors

231
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:08,600
you can make certain assumptions about

232
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:11,720
who the attackers are over time you can

233
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:14,449
get more and more information and you

234
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:17,839
can take any instrument that was written

235
00:15:14,449 --> 00:15:21,079
by some security vendor you can rehash a

236
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:24,279
bridge jacket and fit it to suit your

237
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:27,920
purpose if you do it it's the right way

238
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:30,999
you can masquerade is a completely

239
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,709
different organization so you can

240
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:36,379
masquerade you being an attacker you can

241
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:39,758
masquerade as another attacker if

242
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:41,660
Lazarus can use different programs

243
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:48,019
everybody knows that this is learn

244
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:50,059
silence attach files they sent to banks

245
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:54,999
they use different utilities that are

246
00:15:50,059 --> 00:15:58,699
easy to recognize of course Metasploit

247
00:15:54,999 --> 00:16:00,990
are harder to spot but all the other

248
00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:05,189
things are pretty easy to spot

249
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:08,100
I'd like to agree with you on the one

250
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:13,830
and and I'm going to explain to you why

251
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:18,320
I disagree the question of attribution

252
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:22,500
and masking is sometimes very complex

253
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:28,440
what can make it even more complex just

254
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:34,620
as an example in crime some cases some

255
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:38,880
crimes committed by one person one

256
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:41,970
criminal that tries to pass himself off

257
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,370
as someone else just to just not to

258
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:47,310
because I believe the same thing can be

259
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:49,800
done in cyberspace also I'd like to say

260
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:52,109
that these cases so when certain stages

261
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,709
of an attack or specific actions that a

262
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:59,370
part of an attack can be outsourced to

263
00:16:54,709 --> 00:17:06,359
outsource in the cyber crime market so

264
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:08,520
if we take silence for example Milan 18

265
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:13,409
months following an initial mailing is

266
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:16,639
done by another attack at a hacker

267
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:19,770
organization so hackers can kind of

268
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,959
delegate their responsibilities so to

269
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:24,689
speak well that's a very relevant issue

270
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:29,820
because usually attack starts with a

271
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:32,370
mass mail mailing to banks and then and

272
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:35,090
then you get this the same template

273
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:38,070
let's say one point five years later

274
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:40,379
perhaps so these mailings are done by

275
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:43,139
some outsource or perhaps these this is

276
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:47,220
done by aliens we can we can make all

277
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:50,280
sorts of crazy assumptions okay we we

278
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:52,440
have many also we have first each

279
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,450
payload so we have attach attachments we

280
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,250
can analyze them if you like you and if

281
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:58,440
you are a very interesting a large

282
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:00,170
financial organization you get a stage

283
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:03,470
two

284
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:05,570
and if you analyze all these stages it

285
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:09,500
becomes entirely clear that this was

286
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:12,530
done by personally this the second

287
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:15,800
attach was created revised by the same

288
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:19,220
organization it doesn't matter who did

289
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:23,810
the mailing it matters who is the

290
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:30,590
designer of those payloads yes of course

291
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:36,280
I agree I agree but good but it is

292
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:36,280
entirely you know in legal upon in legal

293
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:45,550
documents we don't have the term silence

294
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:49,700
as far as as far as I know that's

295
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:53,889
returned that you appoint you based on

296
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:57,980
the line of code so how can you prove

297
00:18:53,890 --> 00:19:07,100
how can you prove who is the traitor who

298
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:10,660
is at the top of this actually went out

299
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:13,250
a look at sounds Russian of

300
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:20,750
transliterated awards transliterated

301
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:24,110
into when i look at the code

302
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:25,580
does anyone know what reconnect means be

303
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:28,939
careful when you raise your hand

304
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:31,310
we raise a hand so you can ostensibly

305
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:33,560
you can identify an attacker by the

306
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:37,520
presence of Russian words transliterated

307
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:39,470
using the a white now for that but

308
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:44,300
that's that doesn't tell you anything at

309
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:46,610
all okay speed about silence I actually

310
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,930
a right to reconnect with double with

311
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:51,929
the best with the mm you

312
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:54,530
well perhaps well I misspelled it i

313
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:57,420
misspelled that what do you mean you are

314
00:19:54,530 --> 00:20:03,629
you hinting apt are you suggesting that

315
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:05,220
these words were written on purpose okay

316
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:09,930
but on top of these words there are

317
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:22,410
other attributes that that suggest that

318
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:23,910
the author was a Russian okay okay okay

319
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:26,030
we finally arrived at a common

320
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,030
denominator

321
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:33,450
okay there are hacker groups they launch

322
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:39,780
attacks but how successful are these

323
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:42,090
groups we we all see the attacks but but

324
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:48,060
what's the share of these attacks that

325
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:50,750
lead to incidents there are there's a

326
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:53,750
certain probability of catching a

327
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,750
malware

328
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:07,520
and they smell we're cannot may or may

329
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:12,950
not be detected in an organization and

330
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:16,310
it may or may not caused damage or harm

331
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:19,520
so in other words what's the success

332
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:22,570
rate if the look at hacker

333
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:27,980
organization's overall in other words

334
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:30,470
how many mailings these malware

335
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:34,790
containing mailings lead to incidences

336
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:38,420
out of a hundred well I don't know I can

337
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:41,680
only speak of the banking sector because

338
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:48,040
I come from this Central Bank of Russia

339
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:50,570
well since 2018 the percentage of

340
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:53,899
successful attacks because the Central

341
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:57,679
Bank of Russia doesn't look elsewhere in

342
00:21:53,900 --> 00:22:03,910
the banking sector it has fallen

343
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:06,740
dramatically well before the damage was

344
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:14,450
around a hundreds of millions of rubles

345
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:19,630
the last year last year cobalt and

346
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:25,660
silence originated from Russia only

347
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:30,610
caused 70 to 80 million rubles worth of

348
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:33,980
damage cash flow damages and that really

349
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:37,580
that really makes me happy because I see

350
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:39,680
that cybersecurity guys have been

351
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:43,699
successful preventing those attacks

352
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:46,970
however hackers are going to also

353
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:50,870
improve themselves they are not going to

354
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:53,450
just sit because I know that the tax

355
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:57,590
that are financially made of it moderate

356
00:22:53,450 --> 00:23:02,930
if they are not launched by state actors

357
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:05,330
and they these attackers not supported

358
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:07,880
by as many financial as much financial

359
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:13,520
resources that are available to state

360
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:16,970
attacker state actors I would answer

361
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:20,270
your questions but I wouldn't offer you

362
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:23,870
an industry specific breakdown well it

363
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:29,810
lets us get straight what is a

364
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:34,340
successful attack question you want to

365
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:36,620
ask yourself is as follows let's say

366
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:42,610
there was there's a bank out of four

367
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:46,850
hundred banks and if if there is one

368
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:51,050
successful attack that occurs within the

369
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:53,929
Williams a period of two weeks is it a

370
00:23:51,050 --> 00:24:01,550
success or not success if it only

371
00:23:53,930 --> 00:24:09,770
happens once every two a week but okay

372
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:12,530
if we if we look at all the attacks we

373
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:14,680
should bear in mind that some of the

374
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:17,629
attacks are never known because they are

375
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:21,640
undetected they go undetected so how do

376
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:25,670
you do any attribution you can only

377
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:30,050
build your statistics on the attacks

378
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:31,520
that have been identified and there are

379
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:34,879
some instruments of launching these

380
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:43,610
attacks are completely undetected there

381
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:47,360
are very covert attacks and nevertheless

382
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:51,129
I was talking about the success rate and

383
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:55,600
by way another example about activists

384
00:24:51,130 --> 00:25:00,940
let's imagine that there's some info

385
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:04,419
polls and they decide that when they

386
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:08,610
decide to create a snapshot of some bad

387
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:12,160
sites just take 20,000 websites

388
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:14,949
doesn't matter what these signs do we

389
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:18,850
try to break them which try to hack them

390
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:20,800
is it a success not well perhaps yes so

391
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:23,669
then activists are extremely successful

392
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:26,320
but if hacktivists want to draw

393
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:29,110
somebody's attention to them to attract

394
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:36,280
somebody's attention then perhaps the

395
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:37,479
success rate is not that high so I don't

396
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:42,700
know it really depends on how you

397
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:46,480
measure the success rate you can get a

398
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:49,200
low success rate using one methodology

399
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:55,000
and you can get a completely different

400
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:59,380
result with a different methodology so

401
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:02,440
looking at the espionage cyber espionage

402
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:06,670
probes it's a serious guys

403
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:08,920
perhaps over the long terms these guys

404
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:13,780
are the most successful because they're

405
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:16,360
backed up by really big resources on the

406
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:20,530
other hand people who are only motivated

407
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:23,530
by gaining some financial success or if

408
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:28,240
getting some brand some ransomware

409
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:31,570
designers these guys of course have a

410
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:33,900
lower success rate and they have to

411
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:39,520
adapt very fast they have to adapt to

412
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:42,520
countermeasures music it's kind of a an

413
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:45,770
arms race that exists between financial

414
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:48,990
organizations for example and

415
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:54,180
attackers that want to steal money or

416
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:56,550
yes and ransom of course the financial

417
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:58,140
organizations and deploy all sorts of

418
00:26:56,550 --> 00:27:03,540
countermeasures

419
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:05,670
speaking of hacktivism is be

420
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:12,450
directionality image shoot stock in

421
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:17,220
activism the guys who are activists of

422
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:22,500
course they are not normally a very well

423
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:26,150
organized normally they aren't just one

424
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:28,620
person or a couple persons but but no I

425
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:36,810
I wouldn't say I wouldn't say that

426
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:40,590
hacktivists are I'd like to also

427
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:44,190
highlight the importance to measuring

428
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:49,500
success rate not in terms of success per

429
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:53,030
se but in terms of the results of an

430
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:57,960
attack for example droid DDoS attacks

431
00:27:53,030 --> 00:28:02,129
advances to talk you can break down a

432
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:07,050
service order to prepare wise a online

433
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:09,350
service for a certain period of time and

434
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:15,139
it's very difficult um if some

435
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:18,320
that pedagogy OS attack was launched by

436
00:28:15,139 --> 00:28:20,870
one same world perhaps you're gonna

437
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,399
correct me if I'm wrong which please

438
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:25,820
correct me if I'm wrong it's very

439
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:34,008
difficult to find to prove that a DDoS

440
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:37,700
attack was launched by one single but

441
00:28:34,009 --> 00:28:41,509
more complicated cases one in the lines

442
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:43,759
but with a DDoS attack was an attempt it

443
00:28:41,509 --> 00:28:46,250
so has entered the system and to plan

444
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:51,919
some halo that you do build rapport the

445
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:54,620
three n chicken for example a Trojan but

446
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:58,179
what if you but what if the organization

447
00:28:54,620 --> 00:29:01,129
is successful at finding you can find an

448
00:28:58,179 --> 00:29:03,799
astrologer is mystical is that a success

449
00:29:01,129 --> 00:29:06,219
yes that was a successful penetration of

450
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:11,230
a security perimeter of the organization

451
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:16,399
but no money was lost a no financial

452
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:21,470
damage was done to the organization so

453
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:23,689
again it is quite it is not

454
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:29,539
straightforward when it comes to assess

455
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:32,149
and financial success no look there's

456
00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:35,809
this a comment of coverage percentage

457
00:29:32,149 --> 00:29:38,899
coverage you what can you consider

458
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:41,990
coverage look I'll give an example like

459
00:29:38,899 --> 00:29:44,658
for instance with cars there's a huge

460
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:47,720
parking lot somewhere like here in

461
00:29:44,659 --> 00:29:52,429
giving us there are two types of car

462
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:56,299
jackers the first type we just try and

463
00:29:52,429 --> 00:29:59,389
find the car with an open door or maybe

464
00:29:56,299 --> 00:30:04,580
you're putting a bag in and they just

465
00:29:59,389 --> 00:30:07,330
run up throw you out and drive away so

466
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:11,899
this is the most

467
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:12,889
a mass case and the second type is when

468
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,159
there's an order

469
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:18,169
we need this particular type of car and

470
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:22,460
the difference is it's like a difference

471
00:30:18,169 --> 00:30:26,950
between a malefactor who does mass

472
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:31,390
mailings and other guys who run targeted

473
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:34,400
attacks for instance they had an order

474
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:36,140
just something like doing some financial

475
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:39,370
intelligence in the country in the first

476
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:44,240
case the coverage will be just minimal

477
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:48,439
very 10,000 addresses and only one or

478
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:51,350
two opened so the total coverage was two

479
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:54,500
out of 1,000 and the other one specific

480
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:57,889
was one specific target was addressed

481
00:30:54,500 --> 00:31:01,370
the guys will be you know knocking on

482
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:03,950
and on in the same door and maybe not

483
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:05,418
tomorrow but in a year's time they will

484
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:08,650
succeed

485
00:31:05,419 --> 00:31:10,909
same thing about financial rewards and

486
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:14,450
mailing list there are different types

487
00:31:10,909 --> 00:31:18,830
of mailing lists but there's one type

488
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:21,500
that you do on a like a blanket across

489
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:27,199
the bank then of course the success rate

490
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:30,320
would be low but if you do it in a

491
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:34,340
targeted way to bank that hasn't severe

492
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:39,408
so what you call coverage is rather

493
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:42,799
success rate success rate is a case

494
00:31:39,409 --> 00:31:47,809
where the employer will use this link

495
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:49,639
and the file will be loaded yeah it can

496
00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:52,389
lead to the result in two or three weeks

497
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:56,360
like for instance others an email coming

498
00:31:52,390 --> 00:32:00,320
le spam works 50 percents then there's a

499
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:03,229
sandbox another 50% and only then you

500
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:07,389
get to the final so basically I will

501
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:11,270
consider the success rate on a financial

502
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:12,520
damage or information leak yes yes this

503
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:15,120
kind of

504
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:18,100
the success rate yes yeah with the

505
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,178
carjacking it's clear what you're

506
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:22,540
talking about

507
00:32:19,179 --> 00:32:29,940
it's either myself will drive away on it

508
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:31,809
or the police yeah I would like to add

509
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:34,690
yes indeed

510
00:32:31,809 --> 00:32:40,000
we probably converge in the opinions

511
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:46,300
that is difficult to assess as a success

512
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:49,809
rate if it's more clear with financial

513
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:52,409
crime so if the information is open that

514
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:55,210
there's been an attack that many banks

515
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:57,580
have lost money as a result of this

516
00:32:55,210 --> 00:33:01,929
attack so you can run some calculations

517
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:06,970
but with pro-government hackers whose

518
00:33:01,929 --> 00:33:10,480
attacks aiming to elicit information

519
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:16,690
like espionage so even the fact that the

520
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:20,170
attack happens is covered also I'd like

521
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:22,900
to add that the silence thing they

522
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:25,150
usually send letters into waves wave

523
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:30,330
ones and they have a huge mailing list

524
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:33,340
up to 40,000 recipients and many of them

525
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:37,419
many of these email boxes are not even

526
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:40,959
valid so they send either a link or an

527
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:42,760
image and then after the first wave the

528
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,270
criminals get the information which

529
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:47,530
emails reach their addresses

530
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:51,010
destinations which of them were opened

531
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:55,620
and then they run the second wave with

532
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:55,620
some payload yeah that's it

533
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:04,570
actually I think people have more or

534
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:06,640
less started to talk about attacks so

535
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:09,790
we've been attacked we've been sent them

536
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:14,409
an email but nobody is disclosing its

537
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:16,389
closing a really real incidence that's

538
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:16,750
what people keep silent about that's for

539
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:23,260
sure

540
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:24,668
no not everybody well in our case I was

541
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:28,950
actually quite surprised to learn

542
00:34:24,668 --> 00:34:33,089
because when a concern was being created

543
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:37,029
there was this fear in the market

544
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:39,580
because they would perceive us as a

545
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:42,100
punishing organization and now we were

546
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:46,569
offering something but now they have

547
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:49,440
come to understand that we can be

548
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:53,169
consulted in case they've been attacked

549
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:57,520
so I think the literacy level is growing

550
00:34:53,168 --> 00:34:59,859
at least as far as banks are concerned

551
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:02,320
well I'm happy to hear that there are

552
00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:05,950
shifts in this direction I can't help

553
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:08,800
have been pleased look we talked about

554
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:10,419
attribution about success rate even

555
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,540
though it's quite difficult to calculate

556
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:15,220
it it's difficult to understand what's

557
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:18,640
an incident isn't what it's not an

558
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:22,299
incident people have different opinions

559
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,710
about that and as a result the

560
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,630
involvement at different phases of

561
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:30,460
incidents are also different though so

562
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:34,300
monito try to handle it at the moment of

563
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:37,810
attack investigation teams only see the

564
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:41,520
facts that have already happened and in

565
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:45,940
this case it it all becomes much easier

566
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:48,670
in some cases you can even deduce a

567
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:50,800
purpose of this incident either the

568
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:57,310
money has been stolen all the data has

569
00:35:50,800 --> 00:36:01,020
been leaves or information as regarding

570
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:04,060
the methods from what I hear phishing is

571
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:06,570
the most widespread thing everybody is

572
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:09,750
sending emails both financially

573
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:13,980
and also people who are hunting for data

574
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:16,740
they also send emails anything else what

575
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:19,740
you are encountering is a top three well

576
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:24,270
top one would be fishing top two and

577
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:26,359
three of the attack methods what would

578
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:28,890
you name oh there's nothing else you

579
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:33,000
shouldn't be concerned about anything

580
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:36,330
else oh let me start well perhaps

581
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:39,300
Sergei done enough will tell us about

582
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:40,920
the hardware that people bring in an

583
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,870
organization in our infrastructure

584
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,750
they've been cases they would bring in a

585
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:47,430
device and connect them to locally to

586
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:50,690
the authorities network there are such

587
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:55,640
attacks but for the most part they use

588
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:55,640
vulnerabilities zero day or first day

589
00:36:55,700 --> 00:37:01,919
after the publication of information

590
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:05,010
some device is vulnerable especially

591
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:09,960
trained people start running the

592
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:13,590
scanners investigate the vulnerabilities

593
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:16,650
and I think it's number two into its

594
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:23,940
vector number two of exploitation yes

595
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:34,740
and number three well perhaps number

596
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:39,780
three in popularity would be about

597
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:42,990
exploiting the openness of some services

598
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:46,200
during the day and also people failing

599
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:49,049
to change their passwords for the

600
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:52,919
services open outside exposed outside

601
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:56,570
and you haven't changed some data you

602
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:59,030
mean architectural mistakes made in

603
00:37:56,570 --> 00:38:02,910
configuring the IT infrastructure yeah

604
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:06,300
out of not too popular but the kind of

605
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:10,940
strange of what I've seen recently there

606
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:13,590
was one company where external

607
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:16,110
surveillance was organized for one of

608
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:18,490
the top managers and then they sent them

609
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:26,020
one email

610
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:30,009
with a macro posing as a person whom

611
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:33,099
they have been meeting with and because

612
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:37,230
it's been especially trained person they

613
00:38:33,099 --> 00:38:40,650
passed some training what kind of emails

614
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:43,630
to open and he opened this letter

615
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:48,300
colleagues anything else regarding the

616
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:53,920
methods I will just name top three

617
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:56,830
because across all the bulk of attempts

618
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,200
that you see I would identify phishing

619
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:04,230
and social engineering in one group

620
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:07,720
number one then a web application

621
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:13,920
vulnerability as a popular and few

622
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:19,990
points as number two and the emerging

623
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:27,460
unsafe configurations unsafe credentials

624
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:31,029
that can be did used or maybe that's the

625
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:32,589
same they can be compromised in one

626
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:34,150
place and then they can be used to

627
00:39:32,589 --> 00:39:35,890
access the infrastructure so I think

628
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:38,410
this will be number one two and three

629
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:42,098
you know there are lots and lots of

630
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:45,089
permutations there are different options

631
00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:51,070
for instance let's take a phishing

632
00:39:45,089 --> 00:39:53,080
mailing it is clear now that the more

633
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:56,200
targeted the attack is the higher

634
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:58,660
quality of the email so it's more

635
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:02,799
targeted has less addresses and has a

636
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:06,759
higher percentage of success the trend

637
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:08,740
is such that it's quite easy to persuade

638
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:16,410
people to use your link in this case

639
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:20,040
even opening an attachment the bad guys

640
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:22,440
also adapt to countermeasures

641
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:25,630
countermeasures we have very good

642
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:27,350
examples before right before the New

643
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:29,690
Year last year

644
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:35,870
it was about an industrial company the

645
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:39,650
guys used quite an interesting scheme to

646
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:45,140
oppose as an email congratulation

647
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:49,730
greeting New Year greeting emails so

648
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:53,000
this turned out to be very successful

649
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:56,600
people would not only open links but

650
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,330
also shared if they even applied to IT

651
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:02,750
to open access to the Internet to get

652
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:07,029
promo codes it turned out to be very

653
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:10,940
effective effective in terms of coverage

654
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:17,920
now regarding the success in terms of

655
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:21,710
success perhaps no the mentioned

656
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,900
credentials things it's not really an

657
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:27,680
architectural problem it's about

658
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:31,070
breaking internal policies I want to

659
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:32,870
call digital hygiene in many cases

660
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:37,430
because of ignorance there are quite a

661
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:39,170
lot of cases where we are invited to

662
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:42,290
help for the investigations or to

663
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:44,450
restore the infrastructure and we see

664
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:46,580
it's all happening following quite a

665
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:50,899
simple scenario somebody in the

666
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:55,610
periphery organized a service doing its

667
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:57,410
properly and then the person left the

668
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:59,750
organization and then somebody doesn't

669
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:02,500
know that this service is exposed to the

670
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:06,290
outside then they change a password

671
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:08,180
maybe even for a small time a simple

672
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:13,640
password just to enter and change

673
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:15,890
something and see if it coincides with a

674
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:19,819
brute-force attack on popular ports or

675
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:22,640
for the no services manages to break

676
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:27,260
through the infrastructure and then

677
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:30,009
bring something in I would say it's an

678
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:33,040
architectural problem problem

679
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:36,040
it is actually quite easy to see on

680
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:42,370
small companies that need remote access

681
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:45,460
but that don't have enough funds or

682
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:49,509
resources to do it properly in the same

683
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:53,020
way at an exceptional level so just for

684
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:56,910
a short time they do it for themselves

685
00:42:53,020 --> 00:43:03,060
but then going forward

686
00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:06,399
you know they photo about compromised

687
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:11,650
accounts I think it's also about

688
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:16,630
breaking the digital hygiene from pen

689
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:19,690
tests and from real life cases it's well

690
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:23,980
known that top managers tend to use

691
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:26,260
simple passwords there was a trend other

692
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:30,360
this situation is starting to change and

693
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:34,090
it's very happy to say that so that the

694
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:36,960
safe sir wants to have two factor

695
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:40,810
authentication or with a strong password

696
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:43,390
like five to ten years ago nobody would

697
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:47,830
even dare to ask them to use a strong

698
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:51,609
password but now they've become more

699
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:56,680
educated the second point is about the

700
00:43:51,610 --> 00:44:04,530
web app vulnerability situations may be

701
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:08,649
different but one way or the other some

702
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:11,140
web application of vulnerability leads

703
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:14,170
to the server being compromised quite

704
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:18,129
easily and quite fast so I think these

705
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:22,150
are the top three methods that overlap

706
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:26,530
with others of course but I think this

707
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:28,349
is what most people encounter in day to

708
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:33,109
day life

709
00:44:28,349 --> 00:44:36,329
I would like to share my observations

710
00:44:33,109 --> 00:44:38,339
regarding the top three methods to gain

711
00:44:36,329 --> 00:44:39,210
unauthorized access in terms of

712
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:42,210
frequency

713
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:46,109
I would probably identifies number one a

714
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:49,079
penetrations through email with a

715
00:44:46,109 --> 00:44:51,328
fishing attachment and social

716
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:54,869
engineering of course because the email

717
00:44:51,329 --> 00:45:02,759
should be read movement properly number

718
00:44:54,869 --> 00:45:05,640
two an attempt to connect external

719
00:45:02,759 --> 00:45:08,160
devices with malware to the enterprise

720
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:14,098
network in a physical way and the third

721
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:17,940
way number three is to attempt there's

722
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:21,239
neither guests or enumerator password or

723
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:24,150
use default connections because when

724
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:26,519
installing some services especially in

725
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:31,259
the internet especially a third party

726
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:37,200
hosting providers most users don't run

727
00:45:31,259 --> 00:45:40,999
additional passwords in complexity

728
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:46,828
verification or setting Save Changes

729
00:45:40,999 --> 00:45:50,939
so users may not even know about this

730
00:45:46,829 --> 00:45:53,369
but manufactures and you know perfectly

731
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:56,940
what type of equipment and what type of

732
00:45:53,369 --> 00:45:58,410
software have what default credentials

733
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:03,900
that would be the three types of

734
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:07,578
identify first let me say that I'll go

735
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:11,549
beyond the scope that we're discussing

736
00:46:07,579 --> 00:46:14,579
let's go beyond credit organizations and

737
00:46:11,549 --> 00:46:16,288
include their customers and let's go

738
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:21,289
from bottom to top

739
00:46:16,289 --> 00:46:24,450
to start with it's we are looking for

740
00:46:21,289 --> 00:46:26,819
weak spots in infrastructure settings

741
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:28,950
maybe exploring so exploit a

742
00:46:26,819 --> 00:46:33,239
exploitation of vulnerabilities maybe

743
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:37,549
not very difficult but simple ones then

744
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:40,319
number two the water in the home when

745
00:46:37,549 --> 00:46:41,370
some popular port so in the internet is

746
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:44,960
infected

747
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:48,180
and malware gets the system from it and

748
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:52,350
number three I fully agree with my

749
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:58,649
colleagues it's fishing more talk about

750
00:46:52,350 --> 00:47:00,750
both targeted and a mess as to what you

751
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:04,890
my colleague from solar said about the

752
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:08,130
effectiveness of fishing yes it can be

753
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:10,020
quite effective and the efforts with the

754
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:13,320
minimum efforts because in our

755
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:15,360
experience we had cases where an

756
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:18,650
employee in one organization that were

757
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:22,310
consulting got an email that did not

758
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:26,240
have nothing to do with the IT function

759
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:29,730
and there was an executive of file

760
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:32,160
attached masters an icon he tried to

761
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:34,560
open it nothing appears on screen he

762
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,540
thought was that so he copied the

763
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,880
document to a flash drive came to their

764
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:40,680
friend in another department and said

765
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,910
let's start opening it in your computer

766
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:45,210
this way

767
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:47,040
they tried it on seven different pcs in

768
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:48,960
different departments and you can only

769
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:55,250
guess you can only try and guess the

770
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:57,540
results thank you it's very nice that

771
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:59,640
all of you have tried to answer this

772
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:01,620
question for myself but that pneumonia

773
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:05,819
I'll also be answering on behalf of

774
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:09,650
others so regarding the top three I

775
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:15,290
agree with Anton so that number one is

776
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:17,750
about using emails number two

777
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:23,340
infrastructure web applications

778
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:25,940
vulnerabilities without people for some

779
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:31,350
reason haven't been able to find and

780
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:33,690
number three is about settings regarding

781
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:36,360
credentials maybe this is like an RDP

782
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:39,180
server we supposed to the internet

783
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:42,060
without two-factor authentication so

784
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:45,600
that would be number three as to the

785
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:49,440
funny mailings and position people you

786
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:52,799
mentioned this case with coupons or

787
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:54,210
using flash drive seven times in seven

788
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,940
different computers we had a hero

789
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:59,670
situation one company asked us to run a

790
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:01,350
training after an incident so it was

791
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:03,660
like this a lot of people open these

792
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:07,589
phishing letters and let's try and train

793
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:10,319
them no we said ok let's try let's do a

794
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:13,470
test email across the employees

795
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:16,730
what kind of ok so it's like the owner

796
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:21,149
of the company is sending some letter

797
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:24,300
with the court report and let's see how

798
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:28,350
many employees will open this report and

799
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:30,960
so we arranged the phishing the main for

800
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:33,870
this campaign wrote a letter to a

801
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:36,030
picture from the owners LinkedIn account

802
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:38,130
and sent it out and then we're looking

803
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:41,100
who's opening the letter a minute pass

804
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:44,220
is nobody two minutes nobody five

805
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:45,980
minutes nobody and we're sitting

806
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:49,439
thinking maybe if something is broken

807
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:52,530
and then we come back to the CEO and the

808
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:54,480
CEO says look I'm sure my deputy should

809
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:56,160
have opened my email

810
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,760
we'll come to the deputy said have you

811
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:02,370
got the letter yes have you opened it no

812
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:07,470
so over the over the day it turned out

813
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:10,049
that nobody really opened the letter

814
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:12,480
from the company's owner everybody kept

815
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:17,610
doing business as usual regarding the

816
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:22,950
methods I would add it with a story I

817
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:24,900
can't help sharing it's not now from the

818
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:28,259
side of stock when we see different mail

819
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,800
is in different cases that achieve the

820
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:32,730
results

821
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:35,130
I mean fishing cases but it happened

822
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:38,820
when we were doing pen tests and the

823
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:43,350
integrator site so one of our jobs we

824
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:46,080
also ran a phishing email mailing list

825
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:48,299
to understand the preparedness of the

826
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:50,190
personnel so there was a case that guys

827
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:51,619
proposed and of course I agreed I said

828
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:58,339
yes

829
00:50:51,619 --> 00:50:59,720
the payroll list as a list of employees

830
00:50:58,339 --> 00:51:01,578
was already there so it was very

831
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:05,200
targeted and the effect was almost like

832
00:51:01,579 --> 00:51:08,690
it's nobody Oh nobody opened and

833
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:14,319
everybody responded wrong number so

834
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:19,549
wrong address so actually if you look

835
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:23,000
perhaps you can run you can publish a

836
00:51:19,549 --> 00:51:25,609
separate book about user behavior what

837
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,250
how users behave over they get phishing

838
00:51:25,609 --> 00:51:31,089
emails and with social engineering

839
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:35,859
because every company has a huge

840
00:51:31,089 --> 00:51:38,390
internal of history regarding this like

841
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:40,520
different topics so for instance

842
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:47,629
attention an additional day off and

843
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:53,420
people believe that and all sorts of

844
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:56,690
organized trainings promo codes so you

845
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:59,180
sent 100 people and then you get 124

846
00:51:56,690 --> 00:52:03,670
responses so where did this 24 other

847
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:07,669
people come from you can really you know

848
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:09,980
publish manuals about how to do it and

849
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:12,770
what to expect coming back to the

850
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:15,920
questions who and how runs these attacks

851
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:19,190
and in general can we talk about the

852
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:22,880
geography of the attackers is it

853
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:24,950
relevant not relevant and is it useful

854
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:28,579
at least to know it at all or not is

855
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:32,359
there any value in understanding where

856
00:52:28,579 --> 00:52:34,520
you're being attacked from or is it to

857
00:52:32,359 --> 00:52:38,390
just use this information in terms of

858
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:44,150
security accounting measures what do you

859
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:48,020
think from my point of view 100

860
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:49,520
determination of the attacker geography

861
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:51,980
not the host from which were attacked

862
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:58,119
but the attacker is very problematic

863
00:52:51,980 --> 00:53:01,329
because if you look at what we have

864
00:52:58,119 --> 00:53:07,019
log files at the edge take a look at the

865
00:53:01,329 --> 00:53:11,140
attackers if you see what's coming to us

866
00:53:07,019 --> 00:53:15,669
to the perimeter in the DDoS protection

867
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:20,920
system those sources that come in not

868
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:24,039
really evil makers house it's these are

869
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:26,650
just poorly set of things so the user

870
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:29,069
has a set of something with default

871
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:33,849
values didn't match anything then

872
00:53:29,069 --> 00:53:37,119
malefactors exploited that gain control

873
00:53:33,849 --> 00:53:40,779
and either made this device a member of

874
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:44,680
botnet or use this device to run the

875
00:53:40,779 --> 00:53:47,440
amplification attack and but the

876
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:52,509
manufacturer as such would be difficult

877
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:56,049
to find the geography from the

878
00:53:52,509 --> 00:54:00,069
viewpoints of the victim or will just

879
00:53:56,049 --> 00:54:03,309
depends where this particular malefactor

880
00:54:00,069 --> 00:54:07,538
slave the service service so in my

881
00:54:03,309 --> 00:54:09,309
opinion as this ties may be achieved but

882
00:54:07,539 --> 00:54:10,960
it's actually a much more difficult to

883
00:54:09,309 --> 00:54:13,359
do that for say do you need to solve

884
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:16,420
this task solve this problem is it

885
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:17,828
useful to know where you're being

886
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:27,609
attacked from the geography is it

887
00:54:17,829 --> 00:54:30,009
important or not well if you work for

888
00:54:27,609 --> 00:54:33,910
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs then it

889
00:54:30,009 --> 00:54:37,420
is important but for all the rest it's

890
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:39,730
only you know it only matters for public

891
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:41,950
opinion for security professionals it

892
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:43,839
doesn't matter talking about house in

893
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:46,379
anything anything else you know there

894
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:49,500
are law-enforcement bodies

895
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:51,510
there are investigative bodies I mean

896
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:54,570
there's intelligence there are

897
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:58,950
intelligence services they would be able

898
00:54:54,570 --> 00:55:00,840
to know everything about anyone but for

899
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:04,560
security professionals it doesn't matter

900
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:06,780
what will it affect well to know that

901
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:10,140
Lazarus is from a specific country for

902
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:15,090
it's okay you know it so what you're not

903
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:19,710
going to spend a holiday there well you

904
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:26,690
can use it in what kind of cases if

905
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:26,690
there's a need to bring to justice and

906
00:55:26,810 --> 00:55:40,490
so that in the so you can sense a

907
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:44,040
mystery to another country for instance

908
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:47,669
through the state's enforcement system

909
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:49,740
actually the important search depends on

910
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:51,750
the type of crime have you ever had

911
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:54,060
cases where it was important for you not

912
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:57,210
me I also can't remember

913
00:55:54,060 --> 00:56:02,520
I just like to comment well perhaps

914
00:55:57,210 --> 00:56:06,770
there's this point it's about countries

915
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:12,120
they don't collaborate very well an

916
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:14,550
example not from cyberspace but still

917
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:24,540
about protection from manufactures if

918
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:27,420
you go to the US and web Bank Bank on

919
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:29,340
stripes are used rather than chips and

920
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:31,530
then they copy at a stripe and they try

921
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:34,200
to run some transactions later believe

922
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:38,760
me then in the u.s. there are video

923
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:41,430
cameras CCTV cameras that can see the

924
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:43,650
malefactors and back employers who don't

925
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:46,779
verify the signature but nevertheless

926
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:49,510
when you're back and when you go to

927
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:52,390
the law-enforcement bodies it'll be

928
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:54,730
difficult to enlist their support to

929
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:57,009
find the malefactors the same thing

930
00:56:54,730 --> 00:57:00,370
works in the cyberspace map so this is

931
00:56:57,010 --> 00:57:04,630
the first point to me but it only works

932
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:06,339
if well it works in depending on how the

933
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:11,020
malefactors used the infrastructure of

934
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:13,690
different countries I would make this

935
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:16,500
statement at the same time I would ask a

936
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:21,820
question to Andre as a representative of

937
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:26,140
the customer group of customers indeed a

938
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:29,950
lot of attacks are coming in from the

939
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:33,819
internet maybe there are some you know

940
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:37,149
IP address ranges or blocks that you

941
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:40,990
don't need for work but that I used for

942
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:43,300
repeated brute-force attacks or some

943
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:47,500
hosting services that are frequently

944
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:52,180
used by manufactures to host their

945
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:56,080
payloads do you identify detect and

946
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:59,169
block such addresses princess stori when

947
00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:08,920
a call strike developers made an error

948
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:13,540
in the code and you could I find the

949
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:15,460
Cobra strike server by an extra blank so

950
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:18,040
how valuable is this information and

951
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:19,750
what do the customers do and I'm asking

952
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:24,550
you this question as the only customer

953
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:27,190
represented here for example how you can

954
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:29,050
use or what you can use this information

955
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:37,240
for how can you categorize this

956
00:58:29,050 --> 00:58:41,050
information what what are the blocks of

957
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:43,459
IP addresses that is your not not

958
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:47,750
everything that comes from

959
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:49,940
is harmful the probability that you're

960
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:53,290
gonna get anything good from them is

961
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:57,349
very very load and from Goods

962
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:59,660
whitelisted IP addresses identifying

963
00:58:57,349 --> 00:59:10,490
Hosting's in saying that okay this

964
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:12,710
hosting is a cesspool of infections well

965
00:59:10,490 --> 00:59:16,910
we did it we did it a couple of times

966
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:18,859
but that was not the standard practice

967
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:21,020
without center practice bills holsters

968
00:59:18,859 --> 00:59:25,220
are kind of protection their reputation

969
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:32,710
in even they make a mistake they fix

970
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:36,259
that I have never seen any hosting that

971
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:40,220
hosted bad IP addresses for for a long

972
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:44,930
time for years they quickly fix whatever

973
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:47,279
is wrong with them there's a question

974
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:50,408
from the audience

975
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:50,409
[Music]

976
00:59:52,120 --> 01:00:00,589
well although that is very interested in

977
00:59:54,530 --> 01:00:03,710
just reminds that reminds me of a famous

978
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:06,350
painting about frontin but here we have

979
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:08,930
a lot of engineers not hunters I'd like

980
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:12,170
to review the previous topic about the

981
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:14,359
top of three top three threats and take

982
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:16,490
a different take take a look at edit

983
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:18,440
from a different angle here we're

984
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:21,259
discussing the personal experiences

985
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:23,990
experiences sociable companies many

986
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:25,700
companies at a certain point asked us

987
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:28,939
another question what are the top three

988
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:31,040
threats okay they have defined what

989
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:32,720
these top three threats are and then

990
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:35,600
they start acting on this list they

991
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:38,870
start to kind of take action taking

992
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:42,350
action to make sure that these threats

993
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:45,890
are kept in check so could you briefly

994
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:49,339
tell us all about your experiences we'll

995
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:53,299
deal with this and perhaps there's a way

996
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:59,510
to to turn all of these incidents all

997
01:00:53,300 --> 01:01:03,020
these top incidents to to zero how do we

998
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:05,470
make sure we know that we live not in

999
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:09,100
the ideal world but is it possible it is

1000
01:01:05,470 --> 01:01:12,560
and by the way or what are the technical

1001
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:15,500
limitations that does not allow that or

1002
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:18,200
not allow us to to bring down the number

1003
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:20,780
of threats to zero well such as the

1004
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:24,770
speed of light or things like that

1005
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:28,030
physical limitations so can you talk

1006
01:01:24,770 --> 01:01:31,730
about this in that content I know that

1007
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:34,570
phases can be different but what do we

1008
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:35,680
need to do minimize those threats

1009
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:37,440
yes

1010
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:40,569
that's a very relevant question speaking

1011
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:43,960
when we use equations defined some of

1012
01:01:40,569 --> 01:01:45,880
you use at all customer threats that's

1013
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:49,150
not the end of the story we need to also

1014
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:53,619
figure out how to minimize those but if

1015
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:57,040
you look at any component at a level in

1016
01:01:53,619 --> 01:01:59,319
any area of human activity issues the

1017
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:02,440
companies deal at the worst of all there

1018
01:01:59,319 --> 01:02:09,550
is a list of some essential things that

1019
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:12,880
a company has to do in order to give a

1020
01:02:09,550 --> 01:02:17,740
reasonably first you will take an

1021
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:20,260
inventory which you cannot protect

1022
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:22,899
whatever you do not understand which is

1023
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:24,730
so you have to take inventory of what's

1024
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:27,069
happening in your company if you get

1025
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:28,359
connections that you can't control all

1026
01:02:27,069 --> 01:02:29,950
are corrections to your corporate

1027
01:02:28,359 --> 01:02:33,790
networks that you can control that

1028
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:41,308
already know okay you have to fix it now

1029
01:02:33,790 --> 01:02:41,308
back up that okay that's not theory

1030
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:55,969
[Music]

1031
01:03:49,490 --> 01:03:57,618
all right look this is what I'm gonna

1032
01:03:52,430 --> 01:04:03,640
tell you answer your question okay let's

1033
01:03:57,619 --> 01:04:06,619
say for example we how do we how do we

1034
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:09,170
approach these issues from an

1035
01:04:06,619 --> 01:04:10,700
engineering standpoint everything that

1036
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:12,349
gets into our network should be

1037
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:15,080
authorized how do we how do we make sure

1038
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:16,700
that every disorder authorized there is

1039
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:19,339
the user segment and there is this

1040
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:22,339
surfer segment if on the side of the

1041
01:04:19,339 --> 01:04:26,029
server if it is implemented manually or

1042
01:04:22,339 --> 01:04:30,279
there are automated orchestrators which

1043
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:35,089
is not something that everybody has

1044
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:46,460
where you have more users you can use

1045
01:04:35,089 --> 01:04:49,790
the technology called 800 point 0 1 X if

1046
01:04:46,460 --> 01:04:52,580
the top management that comes to you and

1047
01:04:49,790 --> 01:04:56,000
says okay here's my notebook the CEO I

1048
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:57,980
want to work from it I work to work on

1049
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:01,460
it in my corporate network I cannot

1050
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:04,580
prohibit that because because that's the

1051
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:07,910
CEO I can the only thing I can do is to

1052
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:09,900
explain to the CEO what the risks

1053
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:13,830
involved are

1054
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:16,770
so we just take inventory oh we dedicate

1055
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:20,779
a port which the kids perhaps a specific

1056
01:05:16,770 --> 01:05:24,960
idea I P address and we know that these

1057
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:26,700
these access points are reserved for the

1058
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,590
CEO yes let me give you an example

1059
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:32,370
because we can discuss with this

1060
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:36,240
discussion may go on forever of course

1061
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:40,319
the way that people pack into corporate

1062
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:44,430
networks this way evolves all the time

1063
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:47,970
because in new ways are designed and you

1064
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:49,919
have to adapt because you create a set

1065
01:05:47,970 --> 01:05:52,230
of safeguards and they work for a while

1066
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:54,090
and then all of a sudden you realize

1067
01:05:52,230 --> 01:05:55,740
it's that something else has been

1068
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:58,070
designed something else has been created

1069
01:05:55,740 --> 01:06:05,310
and you have to somehow respond to this

1070
01:05:58,070 --> 01:06:08,450
so attackers create new ways to break

1071
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:13,920
through all the defenses that you create

1072
01:06:08,450 --> 01:06:17,460
and yes this there's a constant tug of

1073
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:20,490
war as a constant curve arms race going

1074
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:22,530
on between the attackers and the

1075
01:06:20,490 --> 01:06:27,439
businesses that want to protect against

1076
01:06:22,530 --> 01:06:31,560
all sorts of attacks let me come back to

1077
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:34,640
the attacks attackers who attacks whom

1078
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:34,640
for what reason

1079
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:44,680
which of you as ever

1080
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:48,650
which which of you have ever faced a

1081
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:49,940
long-term incident for example when you

1082
01:06:48,650 --> 01:06:54,470
already see that there's been an

1083
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:58,070
incident you're in damage control you're

1084
01:06:54,470 --> 01:07:01,430
trying to fix things but it doesn't come

1085
01:06:58,070 --> 01:07:02,860
easy it takes time a lot of effort and

1086
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:07,970
so on and so forth

1087
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:11,000
so which of you have ever found yourself

1088
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:13,250
in such a bad serious situation with

1089
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,290
lots of bad consequences for the

1090
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:16,700
business I'd like to start because I

1091
01:07:15,290 --> 01:07:21,259
believe my answer is going to be a

1092
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:23,419
relatively short but let me first

1093
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:26,540
address the first question because I

1094
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:29,590
believe if it was a very large is a very

1095
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:34,220
big question that I did for the answer

1096
01:07:29,590 --> 01:07:39,130
so here's my here is my big idea there

1097
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:43,910
is no silver bullet against this problem

1098
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:46,820
and this again highlights very strong

1099
01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:50,750
that need for highly trained highly

1100
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:53,510
skilled personnel that understand the

1101
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:53,930
risks that know how to what to do with

1102
01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:57,590
them

1103
01:07:53,930 --> 01:08:01,790
once they manifest themselves and how to

1104
01:07:57,590 --> 01:08:03,830
make clear to a layman that here is a

1105
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:08,630
list of things that you are not allowed

1106
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:15,110
to do unless you don't care for the

1107
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:19,970
company so there are very different

1108
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:26,690
stories what about how how these attacks

1109
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:28,869
occur there are mailing lists there are

1110
01:08:26,689 --> 01:08:34,888
there's the human factor

1111
01:08:28,868 --> 01:08:38,460
and there's a different story in which

1112
01:08:34,889 --> 01:08:40,900
even though people are not trained in

1113
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:44,759
are not formally trained in how to

1114
01:08:40,899 --> 01:08:48,040
prevent security threats these people

1115
01:08:44,759 --> 01:08:51,580
report suspicious activity they report

1116
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:55,330
suspicious attachments suspicious mails

1117
01:08:51,580 --> 01:09:00,158
from suspicious addresses so in answer

1118
01:08:55,330 --> 01:09:06,189
to your question directly I can say that

1119
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:07,598
I represent a monitoring center and we

1120
01:09:06,189 --> 01:09:14,488
try to prevent wherever we catch

1121
01:09:07,599 --> 01:09:17,560
whatever we identified so if so if you

1122
01:09:14,488 --> 01:09:21,129
if you do a great job then there should

1123
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:25,029
be any incidents correct oh you messed

1124
01:09:21,130 --> 01:09:26,889
me up i I was gonna say something but I

1125
01:09:25,029 --> 01:09:29,049
I know I don't remember what I was gonna

1126
01:09:26,889 --> 01:09:34,719
say but okay let me try to give you a

1127
01:09:29,049 --> 01:09:37,719
broader answer later let me start let me

1128
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:42,060
start with cyber crime the longest

1129
01:09:37,719 --> 01:09:42,060
incident I have ever seen in my practice

1130
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:53,790
was started in 2016 the infection came

1131
01:09:49,899 --> 01:09:53,790
in 2016 money was stolen

1132
01:09:54,238 --> 01:10:00,070
unfortunately the bank's infrastructure

1133
01:09:56,590 --> 01:10:02,500
was kind of shared with some other

1134
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:07,000
organization that it was not possible to

1135
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:10,179
completely isolate the network we issued

1136
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:12,130
some recommendations but the bank didn't

1137
01:10:10,179 --> 01:10:15,489
do a great job following this and then

1138
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:17,679
in three weeks time the bank comes back

1139
01:10:15,489 --> 01:10:26,919
to us and says we can see some anomalous

1140
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:32,199
activity so we will and we came back and

1141
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:35,409
saw that the same attackers were back to

1142
01:10:32,199 --> 01:10:36,969
their attacking activity they were were

1143
01:10:35,409 --> 01:10:39,610
doing the same thing following three

1144
01:10:36,969 --> 01:10:41,350
weeks because nothing nothing was done

1145
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:47,620
to make sure that it never happened

1146
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:50,900
again so so then again we we try to to

1147
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:53,159
do whatever we could looking at kobold

1148
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:58,000
[Music]

1149
01:10:53,159 --> 01:11:04,559
after and after the incident or journey

1150
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:10,989
incident response we identified some

1151
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:15,370
programs that were that were supposed to

1152
01:11:10,989 --> 01:11:17,409
activate within three or four months so

1153
01:11:15,370 --> 01:11:19,510
the programs were kind of activated but

1154
01:11:17,409 --> 01:11:23,219
they were waiting for the next thing to

1155
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:27,270
do so the hackers this was kind of a

1156
01:11:23,219 --> 01:11:27,270
deferred or delayed attack

1157
01:11:31,510 --> 01:11:39,620
so I have seen other cases like that

1158
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:44,140
where no if proper incident response was

1159
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:49,610
done of the company that was attacked

1160
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:54,680
money was stolen and then following nine

1161
01:11:49,610 --> 01:11:58,059
months the same attack occurs and again

1162
01:11:54,680 --> 01:12:01,400
a substantial amount of money was stolen

1163
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:05,510
speaking and not about cyber crime but

1164
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:07,309
cyber espionage the landscape there is a

1165
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:12,950
little bit more complicated a little bit

1166
01:12:07,310 --> 01:12:15,140
more interested in cyber spies in fact

1167
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:17,780
tried to keep a low profile and they are

1168
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:19,610
very hard they are much harder to spot

1169
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:22,550
because they are not after money after

1170
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:24,469
all when you when you lose a certain

1171
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:28,340
amount of money you immediately see that

1172
01:12:24,470 --> 01:12:30,110
your as you've lost it but what if you

1173
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:32,420
but if you lose some information you

1174
01:12:30,110 --> 01:12:37,190
still are in you are still in position

1175
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:40,100
with this information so in 2012 in 2012

1176
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:45,139
there was an attack and it wasn't

1177
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:47,390
spotted there was it wasn't spotted

1178
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:54,110
immediately but only at following

1179
01:12:47,390 --> 01:12:56,120
significant amount of time okay I begin

1180
01:12:54,110 --> 01:12:58,360
to investigate activities and

1181
01:12:56,120 --> 01:13:04,550
qualitative discipline when we come to

1182
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:06,308
the customer site we will look at what's

1183
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:17,280
going on

1184
01:13:06,309 --> 01:13:19,900
and I remember in 28:18 for example

1185
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:27,250
there was an incident that lasted for

1186
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:31,570
two years and this was I'm talking about

1187
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:36,699
a financial organization they weren't

1188
01:13:31,570 --> 01:13:39,400
able to take any meaningful action as a

1189
01:13:36,699 --> 01:13:41,530
responsible to respond to that incident

1190
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:43,920
they were they were trying to fix this

1191
01:13:41,530 --> 01:13:51,400
to fix that but they didn't take any

1192
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:56,380
meaningful action but but that has

1193
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:58,509
changed and this has really led to a

1194
01:13:56,380 --> 01:14:04,059
reduction to a reduction in the number

1195
01:13:58,510 --> 01:14:06,340
of the threats and in answer to the

1196
01:14:04,059 --> 01:14:08,230
question about the longest incident it

1197
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:12,219
depends on the definition of incident if

1198
01:14:08,230 --> 01:14:15,218
this is shadow IT these cases I believe

1199
01:14:12,219 --> 01:14:22,900
are quite numerous and they take months

1200
01:14:15,219 --> 01:14:27,340
to address they don't they are not very

1201
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:31,299
harmful the introduced chaos the

1202
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:33,789
introduced disorder into the system but

1203
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:35,820
what they are not as harmful as one may

1204
01:14:33,789 --> 01:14:35,820
think

1205
01:14:36,469 --> 01:14:45,620
I authorized access is not dangerous per

1206
01:14:42,410 --> 01:14:48,050
se and it's very quickly responded to

1207
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:52,550
within three to five seconds that's

1208
01:14:48,050 --> 01:15:01,219
pretty fast I remember a specific case

1209
01:14:52,550 --> 01:15:05,350
and it's been from from the hump for the

1210
01:15:01,219 --> 01:15:11,480
point of compromising security to

1211
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:13,580
identification a one the longest

1212
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:15,709
incident that I remember was six months

1213
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:19,400
long so from the point that the system

1214
01:15:15,710 --> 01:15:22,489
was compromised to the identification to

1215
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:26,599
some to the time when the beneful action

1216
01:15:22,489 --> 01:15:29,259
was taken over fifty II over five years

1217
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:33,739
was the longest one this was a

1218
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:35,719
manufacturing company and the attacker

1219
01:15:33,739 --> 01:15:41,209
was interested in gaining unauthorized

1220
01:15:35,719 --> 01:15:48,530
access to intellectual property it

1221
01:15:41,210 --> 01:15:53,420
wasn't possible to completely the remedy

1222
01:15:48,530 --> 01:16:02,269
is but the domains were based on the

1223
01:15:53,420 --> 01:16:05,210
Windows NT 4.0 and we we saw oh the

1224
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:07,730
attackers had a hard time just how hard

1225
01:16:05,210 --> 01:16:11,900
of a times these attackers had to try to

1226
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:13,459
compile the the malicious code to

1227
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:16,160
penetrate the system of course they

1228
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:19,460
didn't of course the the response time

1229
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:23,360
was not several seconds but of course a

1230
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:25,000
little bit longer okay you asked the

1231
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:33,160
question

1232
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:37,230
about alchemy this movie okay the the

1233
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:43,030
average of ever the most frequent

1234
01:16:37,230 --> 01:16:46,209
incident how long it takes it's kind of

1235
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:49,240
a complex question yes when does an

1236
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:54,810
incident start and when do you consider

1237
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:59,260
the NSA and you matched or finished

1238
01:16:54,810 --> 01:17:02,170
alright alright let's put this all

1239
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:05,140
together we have discussed the

1240
01:17:02,170 --> 01:17:08,950
motivation we have discussed the types

1241
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:13,800
of hackers we have also we have also

1242
01:17:08,950 --> 01:17:13,800
agreed that it's very difficult to

1243
01:17:13,950 --> 01:17:21,400
determine unless you catch the attacker

1244
01:17:19,210 --> 01:17:24,340
it's very hard to know what the

1245
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:26,379
motivation was to either write some

1246
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:29,530
obscene word on the website on the

1247
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:32,760
official website or to steal money

1248
01:17:29,530 --> 01:17:32,759
what is your something else

1249
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:44,170
the geography of the attackers is

1250
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:52,890
something that is not so much important

1251
01:17:44,170 --> 01:17:55,420
it's not so interesting that's that's

1252
01:17:52,890 --> 01:17:57,910
it's not something that we need to know

1253
01:17:55,420 --> 01:18:01,120
and by the way by the way it doesn't

1254
01:17:57,910 --> 01:18:04,330
doesn't give us any advantage in terms

1255
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:05,680
of catching these attackers regarding

1256
01:18:04,330 --> 01:18:12,400
the loss of money

1257
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:15,580
yes that's a very frequent outcome but

1258
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:18,309
what we do with Hector is that's or what

1259
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:24,360
we do if we're dealing with cyber

1260
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:30,130
espionage did you ever try to estimate

1261
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:32,320
the losses the damage of activism or the

1262
01:18:30,130 --> 01:18:34,920
results from Hector ISM or from cyber

1263
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,920
espionage

1264
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:43,530
quite honestly II witted we have too

1265
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:47,630
much tried to do so but it's never

1266
01:18:43,530 --> 01:18:50,880
possible to make a precise estimate

1267
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:52,860
because it depends on how you estimate

1268
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:55,440
what factors you take into account you

1269
01:18:52,860 --> 01:19:03,110
have to you have to analyze the

1270
01:18:55,440 --> 01:19:06,059
situation at a certain point of time you

1271
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:11,370
need to take into account with persons

1272
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:20,940
and organizations affected and quite

1273
01:19:11,370 --> 01:19:23,250
honestly quite honestly it is it

1274
01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:28,410
sometimes doesn't make much sense

1275
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:29,370
because this estimation itself is very

1276
01:19:28,410 --> 01:19:32,400
costly

1277
01:19:29,370 --> 01:19:34,500
yes but okay not a problem we can do all

1278
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:40,740
sorts of estimates if we are paid for

1279
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:47,190
this we can throw as much work at it as

1280
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:49,530
it's needed if we paid but anyway let's

1281
01:19:47,190 --> 01:19:52,799
say for example you sit so actually task

1282
01:19:49,530 --> 01:19:56,940
and then there's a message in the news

1283
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:58,590
that something was hacked and then it

1284
01:19:56,940 --> 01:20:00,480
turns out that this news is about you

1285
01:19:58,590 --> 01:20:03,630
journalist comes to us

1286
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:06,330
and you say there is an opinion that you

1287
01:20:03,630 --> 01:20:08,880
have been hacked and then you scratch

1288
01:20:06,330 --> 01:20:09,420
your head and think what's the what's

1289
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:13,430
the damage

1290
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:20,820
how much money have I lost

1291
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:22,340
so again if there's a lot of bad PR what

1292
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:26,299
you do

1293
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:30,800
is to calculate the number of mentions

1294
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:32,750
in the media you calculate the number of

1295
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:40,660
mentions in the media and then you

1296
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:44,300
multiply divided by the price the time

1297
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:46,630
that you were over which you were

1298
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:54,400
mentioned in the media so it's just like

1299
01:20:46,630 --> 01:20:59,560
considering that that PR as ad time so

1300
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:59,559
that's a way of calculating damage

1301
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:07,730
that's just some metric that you can use

1302
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:11,300
but again if what if there is a lot of

1303
01:21:07,730 --> 01:21:13,040
uncertainty what what if it's what are

1304
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:18,020
you doing okay you can you can assume

1305
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:21,560
that it's 50/50 okay that's one way of

1306
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:28,640
estimating your damage the second thing

1307
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:33,590
that is impossible to estimate all sorts

1308
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:36,430
of espionage stories for example during

1309
01:21:33,590 --> 01:21:36,430
the Cold War

1310
01:21:38,579 --> 01:21:51,820
during the Cold War a drawings of atomic

1311
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:53,920
bombs were stolen or war planes how can

1312
01:21:51,820 --> 01:21:59,079
you put any a number on this how can

1313
01:21:53,920 --> 01:22:00,810
they were they were how can you put a

1314
01:21:59,079 --> 01:22:05,739
price tag on that

1315
01:22:00,810 --> 01:22:10,560
impossible impossible these were state

1316
01:22:05,739 --> 01:22:13,809
these were state secrets that were very

1317
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:20,020
closely linked to the defense of the

1318
01:22:13,810 --> 01:22:23,590
country okay if you have some drawings

1319
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:25,889
stolen it may mean that you have to

1320
01:22:23,590 --> 01:22:31,139
invent something completely new to

1321
01:22:25,889 --> 01:22:37,210
regain an advantage over your potential

1322
01:22:31,139 --> 01:22:41,770
adversary I don't know does that make

1323
01:22:37,210 --> 01:22:48,540
sense to you let's say for example you

1324
01:22:41,770 --> 01:22:52,119
have had you have had a leak of

1325
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:53,860
information about a new service that's

1326
01:22:52,119 --> 01:22:55,690
going to be launched let's say for

1327
01:22:53,860 --> 01:22:59,610
example I plan my service launch for

1328
01:22:55,690 --> 01:22:59,610
tomorrow there's a leak

1329
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:11,730
today we have to assess what how spread

1330
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:16,440
is this information now how far it has

1331
01:23:11,730 --> 01:23:21,629
gone we can go to a quantitative measure

1332
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:23,820
on that as well okay look all right

1333
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:26,520
let's say we're not talking about

1334
01:23:23,820 --> 01:23:32,400
drawings but we're talking about a

1335
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:36,239
patent you file for a patent if you have

1336
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:39,900
not yet patented it you don't own this

1337
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:45,869
IP yet and it's already stolen and what

1338
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:50,629
do you do we've seen we've seen similar

1339
01:23:45,869 --> 01:23:53,549
things in public companies for example

1340
01:23:50,630 --> 01:23:55,320
for example you announce you announce a

1341
01:23:53,550 --> 01:23:57,810
new product you announce a new product

1342
01:23:55,320 --> 01:24:01,230
in you expect your stock price to go up

1343
01:23:57,810 --> 01:24:03,920
and then you see that your IP is stolen

1344
01:24:01,230 --> 01:24:10,769
what you do there's nothing you can do

1345
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:17,820
how can you okay with a patent if your

1346
01:24:10,770 --> 01:24:20,280
product is really valuable working you

1347
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:23,009
can repair temptation perhaps you can

1348
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:25,579
yes you can estimate the costs

1349
01:24:23,010 --> 01:24:27,090
associated with legal services and

1350
01:24:25,579 --> 01:24:34,280
repented

1351
01:24:27,090 --> 01:24:37,280
well Fat City yes I know I'm not a big

1352
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:37,280
expert

1353
01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:49,500
useful patents but if we release a

1354
01:24:43,950 --> 01:24:53,429
service we call it a 1-2-3 service it's

1355
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:56,580
already patented rebranding it costs

1356
01:24:53,430 --> 01:25:00,660
money it it's going to require some

1357
01:24:56,580 --> 01:25:03,390
money to print out some new materials

1358
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:08,340
and so on so it really depends on what I

1359
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:15,930
do what I manufacture that's a famous

1360
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:18,830
picture of a samsung phone samsung you

1361
01:25:15,930 --> 01:25:22,350
remember this probably famous case

1362
01:25:18,830 --> 01:25:29,030
iPhone versus Samsung's I'd like to tell

1363
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:32,070
a joke tell your joke I heard I heard

1364
01:25:29,030 --> 01:25:36,630
about a collusion I heard about a

1365
01:25:32,070 --> 01:25:38,190
collusion between some banks and it

1366
01:25:36,630 --> 01:25:41,280
turns out that the collusion was not

1367
01:25:38,190 --> 01:25:50,759
between real people but between trading

1368
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:53,480
BOTS so I thank you again knowledge

1369
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:54,690
about instruments is necessary

1370
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:56,519
absolutely

1371
01:25:54,690 --> 01:26:00,150
I don't remember if you mentioned this I

1372
01:25:56,520 --> 01:26:03,240
have well in fact if we don't let

1373
01:26:00,150 --> 01:26:04,830
ourselves I can think of thousands of

1374
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:06,420
different instruments that can be used

1375
01:26:04,830 --> 01:26:10,830
for executive well this information is

1376
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:13,480
needed if you are not only going to

1377
01:26:10,830 --> 01:26:16,570
protect your client

1378
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:18,370
that has been attacked but to also go

1379
01:26:16,570 --> 01:26:22,620
after the attacker and this should be

1380
01:26:18,370 --> 01:26:29,890
done and for this reason we have

1381
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:32,710
investigators and we have people who

1382
01:26:29,890 --> 01:26:34,900
study the attack which are the technical

1383
01:26:32,710 --> 01:26:36,310
people and the people who try to go

1384
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:40,889
after the tech okay if you have

1385
01:26:36,310 --> 01:26:44,230
identified a Kabul strike what do you do

1386
01:26:40,890 --> 01:26:44,770
what do you do do you just protect

1387
01:26:44,230 --> 01:26:48,309
yourself

1388
01:26:44,770 --> 01:26:51,100
or do you go one step further you try to

1389
01:26:48,310 --> 01:26:55,260
find the attacker you try to strike back

1390
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:58,240
or maybe take legal action against them

1391
01:26:55,260 --> 01:27:00,370
so identifying the attacker is an

1392
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:03,550
extremely crucial step this information

1393
01:27:00,370 --> 01:27:05,620
knowing who the attacker is may not only

1394
01:27:03,550 --> 01:27:08,560
help you and protect yourself in the

1395
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:14,730
future but also you know recover some

1396
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:18,940
damage that's a very simple example and

1397
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:24,009
can also continue regarding how to put a

1398
01:27:18,940 --> 01:27:26,820
number on the damaged how can you

1399
01:27:24,010 --> 01:27:31,270
quantify the damage that you incur from

1400
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:34,469
espionage let's say for example the

1401
01:27:31,270 --> 01:27:40,660
potential buyer steals your data and

1402
01:27:34,470 --> 01:27:43,030
cannot reproduce this product then you

1403
01:27:40,660 --> 01:27:45,610
lose the entire amount of money there

1404
01:27:43,030 --> 01:27:47,950
isn't our money at the entire amount of

1405
01:27:45,610 --> 01:27:49,870
money that you have invested into

1406
01:27:47,950 --> 01:27:52,620
creating a service or a product yes I

1407
01:27:49,870 --> 01:27:52,620
understand this but

1408
01:27:53,770 --> 01:28:06,350
but don't you think that we will never

1409
01:28:01,670 --> 01:28:11,000
be able to find that a specific glass

1410
01:28:06,350 --> 01:28:18,920
office that we sell the stolen data no

1411
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:23,440
Wynn who attacks us is important if

1412
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:31,130
there is a need if you envision a

1413
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:36,678
possibility of filing a complaint or go

1414
01:28:31,130 --> 01:28:38,929
into the law enforcement if this

1415
01:28:36,679 --> 01:28:42,739
information is limited by the fact that

1416
01:28:38,929 --> 01:28:46,250
okay somebody in country X scanned our

1417
01:28:42,739 --> 01:28:49,849
ports well that information perhaps is

1418
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:52,310
useful but to a very very small degree

1419
01:28:49,850 --> 01:28:55,159
this is this information is basically

1420
01:28:52,310 --> 01:28:56,989
not actionable okay we can we can note

1421
01:28:55,159 --> 01:28:58,549
this information but what we do with it

1422
01:28:56,989 --> 01:29:01,070
there is not much that you can do with

1423
01:28:58,550 --> 01:29:03,199
this information perhaps in future

1424
01:29:01,070 --> 01:29:05,120
incidents responses so this information

1425
01:29:03,199 --> 01:29:08,230
is useful but not to the point where you

1426
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:08,230
can take an illegal action

1427
01:29:14,540 --> 01:29:24,000
alexei you were asking you wanted to ask

1428
01:29:17,070 --> 01:29:25,950
a question my question is was this is it

1429
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:28,040
possible that some groups of attackers

1430
01:29:25,950 --> 01:29:31,280
will never be identified your phone

1431
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:35,100
that's right that's right

1432
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:37,259
if you know for us if you provide a

1433
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:38,700
little bit ok if we provide a little bit

1434
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:41,190
more information about the attacker

1435
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:43,610
that's our competitive advantage for any

1436
01:29:41,190 --> 01:29:46,799
customer that wants to use our services

1437
01:29:43,610 --> 01:29:48,540
or perhaps so that's do it for you in

1438
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:52,350
terms of PR yes

1439
01:29:48,540 --> 01:29:57,269
that's your differentiator our answer is

1440
01:29:52,350 --> 01:30:00,890
very simple since we were great enough

1441
01:29:57,270 --> 01:30:05,640
to be a great research centers we

1442
01:30:00,890 --> 01:30:08,150
National Research Center's we have a lot

1443
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:16,760
of context of the lot of contacts

1444
01:30:08,150 --> 01:30:16,759
contacts with both them and others and

1445
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:25,220
we we we share our technical information

1446
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:25,220
we

1447
01:30:25,969 --> 01:30:30,210
we give them this information and they

1448
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:34,890
decide whether or not they need it and

1449
01:30:30,210 --> 01:30:40,230
what they want to do with it some local

1450
01:30:34,890 --> 01:30:43,680
law enforcement unit thank you well

1451
01:30:40,230 --> 01:30:46,500
actually it's quite clear that from the

1452
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:49,710
regulator point of view it's indeed like

1453
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:51,570
this and because the regulator from some

1454
01:30:49,710 --> 01:30:53,840
point of view represents the government

1455
01:30:51,570 --> 01:30:58,889
and it's important for the government

1456
01:30:53,840 --> 01:31:04,350
but for specific companies it's may

1457
01:30:58,890 --> 01:31:09,120
perhaps be a question depending on the

1458
01:31:04,350 --> 01:31:12,060
specific company outlook so they may

1459
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:14,130
decide themselves what to do take the

1460
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:19,530
course or do something else anything

1461
01:31:14,130 --> 01:31:24,210
that I was too fast it's important to

1462
01:31:19,530 --> 01:31:28,769
add if you know where the defendant is

1463
01:31:24,210 --> 01:31:30,180
coming from you can match his motivation

1464
01:31:28,770 --> 01:31:32,730
or with some other data for instance

1465
01:31:30,180 --> 01:31:36,239
with the political situation it's

1466
01:31:32,730 --> 01:31:40,530
important to understand the actions of

1467
01:31:36,239 --> 01:31:42,839
the attacker and for predicting the

1468
01:31:40,530 --> 01:31:48,540
further actions so this information is

1469
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:52,530
important I would add it's quite a

1470
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:56,010
separate question they touched upon the

1471
01:31:52,530 --> 01:31:57,929
topic of sharing knowledge about this

1472
01:31:56,010 --> 01:32:03,710
because the more sophisticated the

1473
01:31:57,930 --> 01:32:06,780
attacker in terms of motivation the less

1474
01:32:03,710 --> 01:32:09,780
the victims of the causal customers

1475
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:12,900
however are prepared to share this

1476
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:15,500
information with anyone else from my

1477
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:18,000
experience there are a lot of cases

1478
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:21,840
where people are prepared to tell you

1479
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:23,730
some stories but roughly speaking they

1480
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:25,380
keep them to themselves because they

1481
01:32:23,730 --> 01:32:29,209
understand that these same people can

1482
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:35,409
come back to them once again all the way

1483
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:38,929
- not wanting changing the tools methods

1484
01:32:35,409 --> 01:32:47,469
vectors that they were aware of at the

1485
01:32:38,929 --> 01:32:50,449
same time the indicators tactics methods

1486
01:32:47,469 --> 01:32:51,860
being shared among companies is an

1487
01:32:50,449 --> 01:32:55,580
important thing to improve the overall

1488
01:32:51,860 --> 01:33:01,030
situation well our time is running out

1489
01:32:55,580 --> 01:33:06,739
colleagues maybe a few words to conclude

1490
01:33:01,030 --> 01:33:11,679
a wish a recommendation to companies how

1491
01:33:06,739 --> 01:33:16,159
better to protect themselves better to

1492
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:18,520
counter the first two steps to make

1493
01:33:16,159 --> 01:33:23,420
incidents a fewer and farther between

1494
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:26,500
well top three of actions you can do

1495
01:33:23,420 --> 01:33:30,500
well the recipe my recipe will be quite

1496
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:32,480
simple first starts with production

1497
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:34,880
solutions of security solutions at

1498
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:37,459
number one and second you'll never be

1499
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:41,330
able to guarantee that your security

1500
01:33:37,460 --> 01:33:45,349
solutions will cope with all attacks on

1501
01:33:41,330 --> 01:33:50,690
your infrastructure so the second step

1502
01:33:45,349 --> 01:33:53,480
would be to keep working to educate your

1503
01:33:50,690 --> 01:33:56,928
employees your employees should

1504
01:33:53,480 --> 01:34:02,598
understand what kind of attacks and

1505
01:33:56,929 --> 01:34:03,980
threats exist and was what would the

1506
01:34:02,599 --> 01:34:05,869
right course of action be should

1507
01:34:03,980 --> 01:34:10,098
something bad happen and you should do

1508
01:34:05,869 --> 01:34:16,098
it continuously my answer would be more

1509
01:34:10,099 --> 01:34:22,460
in favor well and targeting the IT

1510
01:34:16,099 --> 01:34:26,150
security held so they should understand

1511
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:28,099
the weak spots in the company's

1512
01:34:26,150 --> 01:34:29,869
infrastructure so knowing the

1513
01:34:28,099 --> 01:34:32,150
infrastructure and knowing that we

1514
01:34:29,869 --> 01:34:35,750
expose their that's an advice number one

1515
01:34:32,150 --> 01:34:41,030
and advice number two

1516
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:48,240
no to go beyond technology or

1517
01:34:41,030 --> 01:34:52,290
organizational measures but just working

1518
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:56,750
together with business because to make

1519
01:34:52,290 --> 01:35:00,000
them understand that it's up to them to

1520
01:34:56,750 --> 01:35:01,890
understand all the threats so it's the

1521
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:09,900
instant their interest so it's quite a

1522
01:35:01,890 --> 01:35:12,660
general advice not Universal so and it

1523
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:14,549
you can go very far away here all the

1524
01:35:12,660 --> 01:35:17,970
way to choosing the company that you're

1525
01:35:14,550 --> 01:35:21,060
working for what I would like to advise

1526
01:35:17,970 --> 01:35:25,230
all companies without exception there's

1527
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:29,640
a great international methodology asam's

1528
01:35:25,230 --> 01:35:32,900
of the top 20 security imagine 20

1529
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:39,860
actions that will fit any companies

1530
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:45,900
clearly defined including prioritization

1531
01:35:39,860 --> 01:35:48,660
as it's called San stop 20 security

1532
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:50,610
critical controls you can find it for

1533
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:53,910
free in the Internet

1534
01:35:50,610 --> 01:35:56,190
this is this applies universally to

1535
01:35:53,910 --> 01:35:59,220
everyone regardless of whether you're a

1536
01:35:56,190 --> 01:36:06,330
customer or a service provider or a

1537
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:08,730
vendor if for instance we are trying to

1538
01:36:06,330 --> 01:36:11,760
make the world better if you're a

1539
01:36:08,730 --> 01:36:14,150
customer bring your infrastructure into

1540
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:19,440
order according to the sense

1541
01:36:14,150 --> 01:36:22,589
recommendations if you're a vendor build

1542
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:25,919
your products in such a way that they

1543
01:36:22,590 --> 01:36:28,950
should be safe and secure by default as

1544
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:32,250
an example so that the default password

1545
01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:35,280
shouldn't be admin admin but there

1546
01:36:32,250 --> 01:36:37,560
should be no passwords supplied then the

1547
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:38,759
user should set them according to the

1548
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:40,820
policies

1549
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:44,250
if you hold still and you provided

1550
01:36:40,820 --> 01:36:49,219
versiv ears and different patterns to

1551
01:36:44,250 --> 01:36:52,079
customers make sure that the services

1552
01:36:49,219 --> 01:36:55,110
starting in these patterns by default

1553
01:36:52,079 --> 01:36:59,489
should not have settings ignoring

1554
01:36:55,110 --> 01:37:06,030
security it's better to make them more

1555
01:36:59,489 --> 01:37:13,289
secure but customizable I will agree

1556
01:37:06,030 --> 01:37:16,110
with my colleagues again in know what

1557
01:37:13,289 --> 01:37:18,690
they say but you should start with

1558
01:37:16,110 --> 01:37:22,049
improving every overall security

1559
01:37:18,690 --> 01:37:25,049
literacy of the personnel because today

1560
01:37:22,050 --> 01:37:28,519
the weakest link is the human factor I

1561
01:37:25,050 --> 01:37:32,360
will support the recommendation to use

1562
01:37:28,519 --> 01:37:35,159
the sense methodology regarding

1563
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:38,369
information security in the organization

1564
01:37:35,159 --> 01:37:43,579
you should build up your own security

1565
01:37:38,369 --> 01:37:47,039
what else follow industry standards and

1566
01:37:43,579 --> 01:37:51,049
serve as a representative of the

1567
01:37:47,039 --> 01:37:54,900
regulator can't help mention this again

1568
01:37:51,050 --> 01:37:58,230
because we also keep improving them and

1569
01:37:54,900 --> 01:38:00,598
as we see my colleagues have supported

1570
01:37:58,230 --> 01:38:03,000
my point of view which means that we are

1571
01:38:00,599 --> 01:38:07,380
able to achieve some success including

1572
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:09,469
on the way of a standardization when

1573
01:38:07,380 --> 01:38:14,639
we're talking about top three threads

1574
01:38:09,469 --> 01:38:18,059
wood it will have phishing and endpoint

1575
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:20,639
protection and again the most important

1576
01:38:18,059 --> 01:38:27,840
thing is to train your personnel so they

1577
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:30,110
shouldn't be idiots you know and disable

1578
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:32,039
the security systems second thing

1579
01:38:30,110 --> 01:38:34,558
updating the configuration

1580
01:38:32,039 --> 01:38:37,980
infrastructure what can go wrong zero

1581
01:38:34,559 --> 01:38:40,190
days and here you will find idiots on

1582
01:38:37,980 --> 01:38:43,428
the vendor side

1583
01:38:40,190 --> 01:38:46,190
till three with the same passwords

1584
01:38:43,429 --> 01:38:51,020
policies again same thing so people

1585
01:38:46,190 --> 01:38:56,059
should understand the human error is

1586
01:38:51,020 --> 01:38:59,659
something that no technology to will

1587
01:38:56,060 --> 01:39:02,329
protect you from so I wish that you have

1588
01:38:59,659 --> 01:39:05,480
fewer morons and idiots in your

1589
01:39:02,329 --> 01:39:08,780
organization a good recommendation thank

1590
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:11,629
you for your participation with this

1591
01:39:08,780 --> 01:39:15,759
we're wrapping up a panel discussion

1592
01:39:11,630 --> 01:39:15,760
thank you for being with us thank you

1593
01:39:15,970 --> 01:39:20,329
[Applause]
