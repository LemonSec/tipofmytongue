1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,390
now you're known others cuz I spot a

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:12,360
Slav since I managed to act as as a

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:16,288
moderator you came to a similar session

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,359
last year so then some are you suppose a

5
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:20,430
good presentation do you remember that

6
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,670
him aids I think that this year he will

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:28,799
like it give a like this presentation I

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:32,340
know less so he will talk about social

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,329
engineering and pen testers and I think

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,680
it will be interesting

11
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:41,460
the second section section I'll talk

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:45,600
about something new that we have

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,960
developed that so then the defenders can

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,469
get trained

15
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:55,620
so then good good afternoon I'm happy

16
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:59,579
that you came to listen to me my name is

17
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:09,750
Maksim I present the perspective

18
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:12,479
monitoring company in security

19
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,390
information security with the fantastic

20
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,869
so we do the penetration security

21
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:21,570
analysis so we develop our own software

22
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:24,689
and there so then the automation

23
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:27,419
collection information from open sources

24
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:34,289
and then special projects for special

25
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:37,890
customers we do forensic of incidents do

26
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:40,890
the open source intelligence there so

27
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:46,229
then so we do the investigation open

28
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:51,409
source intelligence as either social

29
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:56,149
engineering to talk about

30
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:59,479
let's begin so first what is social

31
00:01:56,149 --> 00:02:02,960
engineering engineer I think that's

32
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:07,158
you're lowered so the definition from

33
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:10,758
Wikipedia global it's interaction with

34
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:14,720
people using human factor to get certain

35
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:17,958
information although social engineering

36
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,880
is not only information secure the

37
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:22,760
physical economic security

38
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:26,450
so there's any criminal activity and

39
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,880
anything that's in areas where obtaining

40
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:31,599
information may not be the main the most

41
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:35,120
important goal but maybe the goal of

42
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:39,950
money laundering and arrangement theft

43
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:42,110
etc for all these areas they have

44
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:44,720
something in common that the social

45
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:47,420
engineering specialists so they interact

46
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,190
with people they talk to people what

47
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:52,130
what do I need for that so need to

48
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:55,609
understand how people think how people

49
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:58,069
think also ever had a psychology

50
00:02:55,609 --> 00:03:00,370
conference eat with this presentation

51
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:04,819
that would be even more interesting

52
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:07,609
because the social engineer work is is

53
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:10,458
to communicate with the people so

54
00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:12,139
because people people is the key to

55
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:14,720
understand how people think is not

56
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:17,060
sufficient so we need to understand not

57
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,420
only how they think but why do we need

58
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:22,130
to understand how they think so I know

59
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,319
how to understand the weak link and in

60
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:27,049
every system and every that's our

61
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:31,130
information system physical security and

62
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:35,000
so the weak link is the human being and

63
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:36,889
this is all this and sometimes we don't

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,310
mean just to break into the system we

65
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:43,760
need to break into into the into the man

66
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:46,430
and so that if anyone just wants to

67
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,470
attack using social engineering so they

68
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:50,540
always they always achieve results

69
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:53,599
because the throw man you can always

70
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:57,209
hack anything and social engineering sir

71
00:03:53,599 --> 00:04:01,209
allows you to get access to anything

72
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:05,530
and so you can always have a human being

73
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:09,640
I saw them but the disclaimer so we do

74
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:12,790
not have anyone so actually we will

75
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:15,040
simulate the activities of a miss

76
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:17,589
Corinth and that's all but wait you

77
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,409
never will never hack anyone so we stay

78
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:22,239
within the law and we're not brave

79
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,490
just remember this disclaimer is very

80
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,270
important because everything what I'm

81
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:30,430
going to say so should be should be

82
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:33,430
considered from the viewpoint of this

83
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:37,320
disclaimer because I'm teaching you on

84
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:39,940
the but good things about not bad things

85
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,730
we don't do anything without proper

86
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:45,250
coordination although just certainly I

87
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:48,880
will be mentioning certain things that I

88
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:52,090
do without any connections and the and

89
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:55,480
coordination so let's talk about the

90
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:58,060
areas of information security physical

91
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:00,580
security or social engineering yes so

92
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:03,550
then the audit of security when we do

93
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:07,120
this order you first I want to ask is

94
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:10,450
raise your hands those who have read the

95
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:16,030
books the heart of so the art of attack

96
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:18,820
mitnick's box itself those are great

97
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:21,330
books and I recommend them because

98
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:24,520
Mitnick is a great hacker of the past

99
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:27,180
and in his books he describes not so

100
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,770
much technical part just hacking

101
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:33,669
properly says that time here was danger

102
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:36,789
so then he did a test penetrate but he

103
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:39,520
hacked and the so he he tells us that

104
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:47,080
methods of social engineering allowed to

105
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:50,849
achieve any goals and then and then

106
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,849
other companies and institutions

107
00:05:53,870 --> 00:06:00,780
and so you know it was the physical

108
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:03,720
entry physical axis and so that's why we

109
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:05,849
face so there's a physical security and

110
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,340
then the social engineer can go around

111
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:11,670
and then with the help of social

112
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:15,659
engineering so you can do almost

113
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:19,940
anything and assign physical security as

114
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:22,410
well can they can be easily compromised

115
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:25,260
if you if you know what social

116
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:27,540
engineering is so this is these studies

117
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:31,200
certainly whirring large companies

118
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:34,650
research institutions state institutions

119
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:37,020
and military institutions so we have

120
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:40,950
lots of customers ourselves and so there

121
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:43,950
was one weapons that weapons factory and

122
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:47,490
Osaka said that it's it's impossible

123
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:50,849
just to to hack our enterprise with the

124
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:52,890
help of social engineering and so then

125
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:55,230
another corporation says that social

126
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:58,380
engineering is the only potential threat

127
00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:00,270
and because because they do not think

128
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:03,120
that anyone who gets on the territory

129
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:06,150
they do not think as a threat because

130
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:11,390
potential potential enemies can always

131
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:17,130
buy any information and bribe any person

132
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:20,940
but nevertheless - so then so we can

133
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:23,659
talk in greater detail so let me give

134
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:27,210
you some examples here simple results

135
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:30,510
first we have certain companies let's

136
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:34,140
say a plant state plan and there's

137
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:37,110
always so they you can always that's one

138
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:38,820
method how to get inside how you can get

139
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:41,430
inside so there's one method that you

140
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:48,400
can always get inside

141
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:52,590
that's a good method what it takes is

142
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:56,679
very very dangerous to get there right

143
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:58,359
you know it doesn't work here so we need

144
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,030
to understand the specifics of the

145
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,730
company civil engineer yet seventeen

146
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:06,789
thousand rubles the rule is one the way

147
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:07,660
of entering one way of action and

148
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:10,480
beliefs okay

149
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:16,060
ambulance is good if you just drive

150
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:18,310
around so then immediately criminal

151
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:21,880
Criminal Code articles that you'll be

152
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:26,860
liable for okay how else can you get

153
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:31,240
there so there are no there are no

154
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:39,400
soldiers conscripts regarding regarding

155
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:44,890
the plant it's impossible okay in in the

156
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:48,370
words of those there's always one entry

157
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:51,280
hidden entry that that's how the people

158
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:56,230
bring in vodka because because you

159
00:08:51,280 --> 00:09:01,870
cannot work and this always just a

160
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:03,660
little path and there is a hole in so

161
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:07,270
that's why you need just to understand

162
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:10,060
where where you can bring in vodka had

163
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:15,790
the sorry will easily get access to and

164
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:17,890
the second entrance entrance is where

165
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:21,250
you take out something valuable from

166
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:23,140
this plant because what comes in yes but

167
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,410
some non-ferrous metals come outside

168
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:28,330
which they sell because certainly

169
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:31,930
through the checkpoint you cannot bring

170
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:33,640
them just understand how the system

171
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:35,750
works that's an aspect of social

172
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:38,010
engineering it understand

173
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:41,880
understand the specifics of people's

174
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:45,270
behavior it's a good example with the

175
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:51,650
higher educational institutions because

176
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:55,680
I'd read it from him go and I try just I

177
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:58,530
had my ID card and I try just to to

178
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,560
enter other educational institutions and

179
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:05,970
she wanted us to show after you think

180
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:08,489
that this standard idea your show it and

181
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:10,830
he or although you don't study there you

182
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:13,410
just you immediately just come in no

183
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:17,010
problem so that's why any idea will work

184
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:20,150
although I have no right for example if

185
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:25,160
you really want just to have to bring in

186
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:28,949
bring in a person without paying $14,000

187
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:31,589
in eighteen so it can be done without

188
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:33,830
paying fourteen thousand to attend this

189
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,830
conference

190
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,010
that's correct

191
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:53,160
you see just about how many friends are

192
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:53,160
around of that kind okay something else

193
00:10:55,530 --> 00:11:01,860
yes if you if you pretend that you left

194
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,860
it at home

195
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:15,729
so then getting back to our plants

196
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:19,569
method that works very well very close

197
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:22,420
to the career options when you when they

198
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:26,200
pretend to be career at such plants very

199
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:29,829
often certain territory is leased and

200
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:33,550
the tenants and the companies themselves

201
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:37,900
so they so they offer certain services

202
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:42,880
to private individuals in Moscow so we

203
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:47,740
have very high secret inspector that is

204
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:51,250
the mold and in microwave weapons so

205
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:53,920
they they don't know if any more time on

206
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:56,110
their side there was a page so where

207
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,540
they but they were saying that there may

208
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:02,200
different vegetarian and all these

209
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:05,110
crosses the butterflies so you come to

210
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:08,620
the checkpoint and then and then you say

211
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:11,290
that you want to buy a batch of crosses

212
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:13,480
right here is my passport that you enter

213
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:16,089
that's it so that they will tell you so

214
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:19,180
they will be there so unshrunk where

215
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:21,340
they enrich uranium so by then just if

216
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,430
you you should disregard it if you keep

217
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:25,750
walking forward and then at the next

218
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:29,140
crossing is turning left and so they

219
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:31,630
don't go into the shop into the where

220
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:35,350
they enrich uranium that's it so you go

221
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:37,840
in and easily so they pass one shot

222
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,950
another shop and then all of a sudden

223
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:46,000
they went into the

224
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:51,900
chomp Caprica social engineering was

225
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:55,570
there and then the Saudi certainly had

226
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:57,640
the counterfeit key keys and then there

227
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:59,950
was another thing that brought was

228
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,230
brought into play because where will you

229
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:04,180
how will you get out because if you

230
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:06,190
don't get out in an hour stand it will

231
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,530
start suspecting because because they

232
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:11,440
are all down your the number of your

233
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:14,579
passport and it's about in every but in

234
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,890
every place out there is a there is a

235
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:21,430
there is a fixed line at phone right

236
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:23,230
with the list of of hold a holder

237
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:25,359
workers and then there is a place where

238
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:28,120
you can change right so it can take

239
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,580
fatigues it can change so they opened

240
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,430
the book yes and if you want just to get

241
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:35,410
someplace else so I can always dial the

242
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:40,239
number you can dress up like a worker

243
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:42,219
and exceed petroi sent me I'm getting

244
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,700
just to send your craft low voice so

245
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:58,600
will you please let them come in into

246
00:13:45,700 --> 00:14:01,930
short number seventeen she will

247
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,640
immediately let you in so then after

248
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,979
just if you're moving around and then

249
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:09,580
you get tired of it and then when it

250
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:11,890
gets dark you can always unofficially

251
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:14,290
leave the premises so you can just jump

252
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:16,960
over the fence this is it

253
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:19,660
so this is social engineering and so but

254
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:25,840
these methods work and the nature fully

255
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:30,660
realized that that I don't so then in

256
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,660
order to IT security physical security

257
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:37,609
if you have if you if you think that the

258
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:40,339
miss current wants to get someplace

259
00:14:37,609 --> 00:14:41,029
you'll stop at nothing and he will stop

260
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:44,869
at nothing

261
00:14:41,029 --> 00:14:47,979
and he'll try every method so then the

262
00:14:44,869 --> 00:14:50,959
project activities there was a case when

263
00:14:47,979 --> 00:14:54,499
seven we went to a certain customers

264
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:57,079
company beyond the urals manager was

265
00:14:54,499 --> 00:15:01,549
there and one of the researchers said

266
00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:03,799
they came a bit further traffic jams the

267
00:15:01,549 --> 00:15:06,319
king of the customer called the manager

268
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:09,139
so they asked you to let them in well I

269
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:12,618
said I'm still in the meeting so wait so

270
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:16,519
they they waited for the minister so

271
00:15:12,619 --> 00:15:21,319
they found that so then a conference

272
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:23,539
room and then a lady janitor she said

273
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:25,789
what are you doing there I thought those

274
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:27,529
people suspicious and he said some are

275
00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:29,959
waiting for a meeting that was the

276
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:38,029
president and and the janitor says so

277
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:41,839
let me open their office office his

278
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:47,179
office and our researchers connected to

279
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:52,069
the so the internet is their net and by

280
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:54,889
the time the president came in so they

281
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:57,410
they told him that so we had learned

282
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:59,989
everything as other than the map of the

283
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:02,779
internal and their network has been

284
00:15:59,989 --> 00:16:05,119
built and and then the vulnerability map

285
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:07,850
has been done that's easy

286
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:09,889
so then economic security and social

287
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:15,709
engineering so the maybe several goals

288
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:18,559
so this is combating fraud this is the

289
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:21,529
special ministries do that so customers

290
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:23,988
will come to us so providing such

291
00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:26,119
services and their nature said not so

292
00:16:23,989 --> 00:16:27,580
much just to put someone in jail but

293
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:31,390
understand what the hell

294
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:34,510
so for example if if those who want to

295
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:40,769
understand that so then for example this

296
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:46,649
fraud had different activities of

297
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:50,500
subsidiaries or overall that tender so

298
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:55,329
they want us to simulate the activities

299
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:57,790
of the miscreant or the victim so the

300
00:16:55,329 --> 00:17:00,969
methods are standard so then that's our

301
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:04,329
service to we lie lie lie lie that said

302
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:06,010
those are the best thing because and

303
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:08,619
those who have experience in working

304
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:11,829
with the Ministry of Interior so they

305
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:14,678
they could be a mystery mystery by has

306
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:17,800
some mysteries the mysteries supply and

307
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:19,959
then they could be mystery shopper earth

308
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:24,369
can be just a certain purchase under

309
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:27,209
control and so this is this so then the

310
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:32,229
main ideas to become more competitive

311
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:35,790
than competition reconnaissance so I

312
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:38,550
call it an analyst a lady and she

313
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:42,309
remember that that I'm doing this

314
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:47,350
comparative reconnaissance and so she

315
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:51,370
wanted to she wanted to fire me but

316
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:53,740
since so then it's the interview was

317
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:57,760
supposed to be taken place and they in

318
00:17:53,740 --> 00:18:03,669
our competitors office so I sent her my

319
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:06,100
CV and I told her what I learn more

320
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:08,919
about the projects about the teams about

321
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:12,040
the customers about more about the

322
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:14,770
number of the employees more more about

323
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:17,409
the nature of business etc and I started

324
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:22,929
asking all those questions and the tray

325
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:27,220
and eventually so when so after dozens

326
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:28,870
or my questions so that the person was

327
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:32,039
named I wrote down

328
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:35,529
why I decided to leave the company I

329
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:38,350
said I'm not planning to leave the

330
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:40,870
company so I am the planning tilde B why

331
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:44,230
did you come and I said because it was

332
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:47,110
interesting it was interesting so they

333
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:52,020
were very unhappy yes then actually I

334
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:59,949
escaped to be the technical part of the

335
00:18:52,020 --> 00:19:00,460
house interview and then let's go

336
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:08,710
further

337
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:12,399
so then information security information

338
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:15,130
security so then the audit of

339
00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:19,059
information security this is where

340
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:20,470
social engineering can be used so why

341
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:22,750
for what

342
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:23,980
so first with the help of social shaking

343
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:27,820
you can access to confidential

344
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:30,549
information sensitive information so

345
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:33,730
telltale is a policy about the passwords

346
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:36,220
it's okay how can I get the access to

347
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:39,970
physical access to the information

348
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:44,700
system I've given you an example the

349
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:49,029
specific case because we had different

350
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:54,399
different tasks which we faced things

351
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:57,399
that was one case where the company so

352
00:19:54,399 --> 00:20:01,320
they provide information that outside

353
00:19:57,399 --> 00:20:06,580
control zone so so they have a printer

354
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:09,070
printer and you can easily represent it

355
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:13,240
yourself as a client of the company can

356
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:16,750
easily come and then and then just to

357
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,630
stay in the bathroom for an hour yes and

358
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:21,800
then whether

359
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:24,770
come out to this printer and start doing

360
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,540
whatever you want because a UFO this is

361
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:28,850
used not only for one purpose of

362
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:31,639
printing and they send and running

363
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:34,280
copies but a UFO

364
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,200
it is definitely if there so can be I

365
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:39,560
can be a can be useful the other

366
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:42,560
purposes and you can easily get the list

367
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:45,889
of those who sent documents for printing

368
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:48,500
so their direction the addresses and

369
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:50,780
their so the list of the documents can

370
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,210
be obtained easily you can go to a

371
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:56,480
domain of this printer and I never

372
00:20:53,210 --> 00:21:02,540
tested I'm sure it's not protected it

373
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:05,950
isn't exactly and and you can always

374
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:11,330
connect your device to it this printer

375
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:13,820
and connect to the printer and then you

376
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:16,699
can steal all the documents that's a

377
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:18,980
data center and so that's the redirect

378
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:21,530
all the documents which meant for

379
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:24,410
printing is so to to be sent to another

380
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:26,570
address that's it and so they can do it

381
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:29,600
both not only with your brains but with

382
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:31,879
your hands and feet are checking the

383
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:36,439
efficiency of the operation with the

384
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:43,100
iTIP they'll be etc as you see I feel

385
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:46,580
guilty and then actually draw the

386
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:51,020
systems of monitoring the employees so

387
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:53,960
that if and if your employee launched a

388
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:55,940
virtual machine and they you don't see

389
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,830
it what can you do and they say you

390
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:00,410
can't do nothing so that's why the

391
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:05,510
interaction safe sisters it's a

392
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:07,790
technical issue if the user sends the

393
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:10,580
information he reads it from the screen

394
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:15,110
or take pictures of it so the system

395
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:17,490
certainly won't do anything but put the

396
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:21,659
source of information leakage

397
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:23,760
and because sir he is inside and that

398
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:30,750
blows up the system from inside although

399
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:34,110
I had one of the customer said who was

400
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:37,710
sending a screenshots screenshots and

401
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:40,559
pictures of the screen and then then we

402
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:42,870
convinced him that they here has to give

403
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,790
us an access to the server and then you

404
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:47,370
won't have to send us screenshots we can

405
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:51,389
do everything by ourselves and the

406
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:54,540
customer did not mind it so then so we

407
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:58,050
need to check the services of IT and and

408
00:22:54,540 --> 00:23:00,389
the intern and universities because our

409
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:02,790
efficiently they were sorry they pay

410
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:05,250
well so certainly they want this to work

411
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:07,860
and the special agency is supposed to

412
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:12,450
work well but it doesn't work well and

413
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:16,050
so there were very few projects you have

414
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:19,370
to have to break in and so they service

415
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:22,500
so information security did not identify

416
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:27,689
the fact of breaking with the help of

417
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:29,960
social and engineering then checking

418
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:33,020
about the awareness of the employees

419
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:36,030
because as everyone says for example

420
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:38,480
don't put a yellow pillow paper on the

421
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:41,399
monitor with the numbers and passwords

422
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,970
and they disregard them they still do it

423
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,950
and this is why sometimes they simply

424
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:48,780
does not understand what is it that he

425
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:51,179
violates and that certainly leads to

426
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,590
leakage of information along technical

427
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:56,090
channels and the center of social

428
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:56,090
engineering channels may help

429
00:23:58,299 --> 00:24:04,869
so I'll talk more about that and so

430
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:06,729
whether we do the phishing attacks so

431
00:24:04,869 --> 00:24:13,809
that to lay principles we either try to

432
00:24:06,729 --> 00:24:17,139
get this the ID data and or just who we

433
00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:19,899
send a questionnaire isn't and they're

434
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:23,978
so they forget this information fishing

435
00:24:19,899 --> 00:24:27,218
or just we do trade sites or we

436
00:24:23,979 --> 00:24:30,639
distribute the content so when it opens

437
00:24:27,219 --> 00:24:33,279
up immediately goes back as connects you

438
00:24:30,639 --> 00:24:36,339
to the miscreants or markers for example

439
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:39,299
this kind of works and so then

440
00:24:36,339 --> 00:24:42,009
practically ninety percent cases we just

441
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:46,109
we say that these instructions have been

442
00:24:42,009 --> 00:24:46,109
violated and that's one of the cases

443
00:24:48,329 --> 00:24:55,299
probably the most interesting depending

444
00:24:51,459 --> 00:24:58,539
on what you do if you do things that

445
00:24:55,299 --> 00:25:06,009
have to do with them security auditor or

446
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:10,149
for those who do would not go to jail it

447
00:25:06,009 --> 00:25:16,169
is necessary at the documentation stage

448
00:25:10,149 --> 00:25:20,218
and to set up those engagement rules

449
00:25:16,169 --> 00:25:22,539
that goes through the scope of works and

450
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:25,200
how those work should be done the

451
00:25:22,539 --> 00:25:28,029
customers don't like when our is rich

452
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:33,339
intrude into their production processes

453
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:36,249
so that's why we exclude denial of

454
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:38,049
service attacks and they asked their

455
00:25:36,249 --> 00:25:40,649
engineers not to disclose any

456
00:25:38,049 --> 00:25:44,200
information that will be available and

457
00:25:40,649 --> 00:25:46,178
any information and the kind of violate

458
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:51,879
certain agreements that they had signed

459
00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:53,669
a different stage we need to to actually

460
00:25:51,879 --> 00:25:56,199
check the target so if you want to

461
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:58,659
understand the security services or

462
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:01,269
that's one thing if you want to get some

463
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:02,859
configured to check the opportunity to

464
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:04,240
get confidential information it's

465
00:26:02,859 --> 00:26:06,429
another thing event

466
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,090
type of attacks fishing yes almost

467
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:12,820
fishing no we don't want us to to be

468
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:14,949
called on the phone so lately the number

469
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:19,870
inquiries for social engineering is

470
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:23,650
actually growing and inspections to

471
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:28,120
about five years ago in every Auditor we

472
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:30,760
said that no social engineering and now

473
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:35,050
as you know who the hacker will not ask

474
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:37,060
you if he is permitted to do social

475
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:40,450
engineering he will use it in any way

476
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:42,820
and then category of people for instance

477
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:45,220
call center operators can be called but

478
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:48,310
she said means are not permitted to be

479
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:50,620
called if you have so many restrictions

480
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:53,919
it will be difficult to get a picture

481
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:57,550
and do something than the timing very

482
00:26:53,920 --> 00:27:02,860
often the information services are

483
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:05,980
trying to to get the information about

484
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:08,229
the upcoming research and sometimes so

485
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:11,890
they are quite lazy and the wonder when

486
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:13,960
we do it so that it would be in the

487
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:15,760
contract so that they could have they

488
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,790
should go to work on this week and do

489
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,590
something so that they would be present

490
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:23,680
during the audit what would be the legal

491
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:25,870
problems as so when you perform that if

492
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:28,360
they were access you can actually break

493
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:30,399
those rules of engagement violator by

494
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:33,370
chance because social engineering is a

495
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:36,880
creative process if for instance during

496
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:38,919
the call the person starts giving you

497
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,200
some confidential information you should

498
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:43,930
not say please stop there are something

499
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,360
else and then the third part is rights

500
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:48,520
as the customers have clients if we try

501
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:52,560
to get access to sensitive information

502
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:55,570
it may happen that this information will

503
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:58,629
belong to the client not your customers

504
00:27:55,570 --> 00:28:00,159
so you have to be very careful probably

505
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:03,240
not at the stage of information

506
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:06,850
collection but a final report and then

507
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:09,580
the privacy right

508
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:13,030
another murky question in the context

509
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:15,610
over a security system and monitoring

510
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:18,310
the employees and their workstations if

511
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:21,550
we get some technical access to their

512
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:24,659
jaw workstations and then include some

513
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:27,129
screenshots or more archives or whatever

514
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:30,580
downloaded from the local machine that

515
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:32,070
contains personal correspondence or some

516
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:38,080
hope for me

517
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:41,169
you may find it may be sensitive if you

518
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:45,310
are not an operator who should get all

519
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:49,620
the permissions and getting some data so

520
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:52,090
that you're caught in the force of the

521
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:54,669
research would be wrong

522
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:57,669
very often we encounter situations that

523
00:28:54,670 --> 00:29:01,960
require urgent solutions so when I was

524
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:06,460
an analyst I would read and it says we

525
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:09,880
got access to every metal air rm2 and

526
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:12,910
any place is through key logger we got

527
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:15,970
the password from his Google account I

528
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:18,310
start getting nervous just in

529
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:21,130
correspondence with his girlfriend we

530
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:23,379
discovered that you know we usually

531
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:25,930
delete such things that removes things

532
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:30,870
like that from our reports we try to

533
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:35,670
prevent that and we have similar cases

534
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:35,669
and it may present a problem

535
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:42,120
now let us switch to a more technical

536
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:45,690
part then I'll talk about practical

537
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:50,850
cases so during such forensic

538
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:55,220
investigation we test for open source

539
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:58,370
intelligence and social engineering and

540
00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:02,730
in other terms

541
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:07,830
if you human intelligence interaction

542
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:10,920
with people they're all related if you

543
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:14,310
consider some separate procedures and I

544
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:17,940
see a cinder Pinterest or whatever OSINT

545
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:20,220
and each of them may supply some

546
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:24,150
information for further social

547
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:26,610
engineering attacks so we start with a

548
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:31,200
synth phaser for instance a customer

549
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:35,550
tells you that you that he wants to

550
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:37,830
check his network infrastructure through

551
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:40,740
social engineering we need to collect

552
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:43,770
data about the resources he has then TNS

553
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:45,810
intelligence was an director itself

554
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:48,180
which occurred networks can we do

555
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:51,300
network say and very often we would

556
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:54,180
discover some lists of employees and

557
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:56,760
information from us in the proper mail

558
00:30:54,180 --> 00:31:01,470
server and then we shall use it for

559
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:05,370
social engineering attacks Oh Center

560
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:07,410
methods automatically we collect

561
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:11,459
information about employees and social

562
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:15,440
network where the customer wants the

563
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,440
opportunity to influence them in

564
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:21,780
different ways as so we we perform this

565
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:24,270
pin test adjust them in the breaking a

566
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:26,850
part of system hacking a part of system

567
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:30,120
we can get a directory list of users

568
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:33,570
list of emails the servers and some

569
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:37,469
logins and passwords and in fact the

570
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:40,280
phishing attack uses a new user created

571
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:40,280
in a local network

572
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:46,780
with the internal corporate email and it

573
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:49,389
will be more successful than any mailing

574
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:51,820
from some mailroom address we need to

575
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:53,890
understand that and this context and I

576
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:59,490
shall probably go back to my wonderful

577
00:31:53,890 --> 00:32:02,320
picture the interaction of those ways

578
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:04,990
like Pinterest from technical experts

579
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:08,428
and the open source information and

580
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:12,309
expert on social engineer is critical

581
00:32:08,429 --> 00:32:16,140
for successful attack because this is an

582
00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:20,950
iterative process and that actually

583
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:24,940
flows from one sector to another and

584
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:27,520
again we need to know the social

585
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:30,640
engineering as a process of interacting

586
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:33,360
with people is based on communication on

587
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,850
some correspondence and requires

588
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:39,760
psychological knowledge I can briefly

589
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:42,730
touch upon the aspects of social

590
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:45,030
engineering I cannot boast I am one

591
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:49,720
[Music]

592
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:52,660
actually I don't meet some requirements

593
00:32:49,720 --> 00:33:00,220
I don't have a general perception

594
00:32:52,660 --> 00:33:02,890
so first is confidence when you just

595
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:05,200
enters the building and show around

596
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:08,590
document of the course you need to make

597
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,870
sure that the gold is guilty you should

598
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:14,139
not touch you if you call someone and

599
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:16,809
you tell a secretary in to introduce

600
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:18,429
yourself as a company leader you should

601
00:33:16,809 --> 00:33:22,470
say it in such a way that she should

602
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:25,690
there you know be sure be confident so

603
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:28,350
it's a psychological confidence and the

604
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:31,900
speed of response and you can actually

605
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:34,270
you think on the go you should think on

606
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:36,250
the go because in some cases they are

607
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:38,379
suspect something and ask question just

608
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:43,690
like my college happens to my products

609
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:47,880
if for instance a janitor is asking what

610
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:51,510
you do and the janitor well is unhappy

611
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:55,500
and actually they will get access to the

612
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:58,530
room from which they could do their miss

613
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:02,100
miss miss miss miss joins and that's a

614
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:04,500
key aspect another aspect all the

615
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:09,210
psychological groups are about it if you

616
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:11,129
do this you should move it you should

617
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:16,260
know the context you should be confident

618
00:34:11,129 --> 00:34:18,600
you gather information and then you you

619
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:21,990
should understand who your impersonate

620
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:23,940
and how the company works so this

621
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:29,759
information is critical a typical

622
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:32,070
example is when does they attack the the

623
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,960
this kind of sting operation the

624
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:38,250
protecting you know we had an insurance

625
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:44,520
company we made we gathered information

626
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:50,219
about the structure the legendre for the

627
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:52,080
way whereby we on behalf of a person who

628
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:55,589
was on vacation and required information

629
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:59,090
about the system that we know the

630
00:34:55,590 --> 00:35:02,820
customer has because also we found that

631
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:05,970
your position said from a headhunter so

632
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:10,920
understanding the internal processes are

633
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:13,700
arranged people is the second key factor

634
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:17,010
and then you have to turn to an

635
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:23,700
authoritative person it's either you

636
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:25,890
mentioned a specific name because no one

637
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:29,399
wants to fail his boss if you say you

638
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:31,980
call on behalf of manager John Smith a

639
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:36,380
speaking worker because people don't

640
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:39,380
want to understand it Toto to fail him

641
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:39,380
sometimes

642
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:49,790
appealing to a router and so a

643
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:49,790
perpetrator

644
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:58,529
so stickers on the devices it works if

645
00:35:55,020 --> 00:36:03,090
you go to any office in length and say I

646
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:05,820
am from technical support just come up

647
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:08,870
and just conduct some ketchup and take

648
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:15,890
it away probably just because people

649
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:15,890
never imagine you are an attacker you

650
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:26,730
just put a sticker and so turning to

651
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:32,190
emotions you need to understand that

652
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:35,150
people are human and they can feel pity

653
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:38,010
they can sympathize with you try to help

654
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:42,030
or respond negatively you you should

655
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:48,990
account for it if you cannot complain or

656
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:51,870
ask for something like a real fraudster

657
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:54,509
you can for instance find some common

658
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:57,060
interest with a person like calling a

659
00:36:54,510 --> 00:37:01,860
technical expert and in the conversation

660
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:03,960
you mentioned that you hate the you hate

661
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:05,970
the software and he has to use he will

662
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:11,400
agree with you and you have a common

663
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:16,890
point you can move on agreed

664
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:19,590
I fear sloth greed fear is mainly when

665
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:24,150
you also want to say that I need this

666
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:26,760
information and 15 info or else the

667
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:28,950
retribution will be swift and in a lot

668
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,050
most lot you need to call at 8:00 a.m.

669
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:33,960
and say you need to come and set up

670
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:36,030
something and he tells you can I just

671
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,550
give you my login and password you say

672
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:42,390
well yes give me a login and password

673
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:45,750
that that greed that the fraudsters use

674
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:47,700
you need proposal five minutes only only

675
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:50,520
for 3000 rubles

676
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:55,290
yesterday it was ten thousand rubles and

677
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:58,320
it can make sense if first as you say to

678
00:37:55,290 --> 00:38:01,140
the salespeople market ologists you want

679
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:04,860
to gather information about the client

680
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:09,390
you can say that you just take control

681
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:13,380
another expert and he will perform this

682
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:15,600
work for the customer or the company

683
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:18,930
will lose money if the person doesn't

684
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:22,350
move and the person was saying that he

685
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:25,049
is his you know he's in the limelight

686
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:27,060
and he will tell you everything just to

687
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:31,800
get an award and finally he's not

688
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:34,440
getting any control in the conversation

689
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,120
you need to control the thoughts you

690
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,310
should know how to you know immediately

691
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:40,200
shoot out all your questions but you

692
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:43,470
need to manipulate the attention of the

693
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:47,040
person you talk to in order to take the

694
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:51,629
conversation from a dangerous point to

695
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:53,610
say a points you need because if you

696
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:56,070
badger him with new information about

697
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:59,250
the things that are important he will be

698
00:38:56,070 --> 00:39:07,010
on board or he will he will not be able

699
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:07,010
to you you need to kind of disarm him

700
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:17,520
Russian in Russian if you rush him if

701
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:21,029
you if you need to to pretend that there

702
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:24,150
is no time to conversation so it's kind

703
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:25,770
of a moment of urgency yes you can tell

704
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:28,890
years you have to have half an hour

705
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:31,830
otherwise it's lost or you can choose to

706
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:33,540
risk a settle for unimportant questions

707
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:38,819
that don't matter

708
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:40,950
and if you start by introducing yourself

709
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:43,380
and then ask him to take a pen and a

710
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:47,669
pencil and start dictating then

711
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:50,430
a person will come to a condition when

712
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:56,400
he can tell you whatever whatever you

713
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:57,930
want and sensory overload and if you are

714
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,730
familiar with the contents you can

715
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:01,730
pretend to be sure and you kind of

716
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:07,200
impersonate technical support with so

717
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:11,010
many technical details that the person

718
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:13,230
will just get lost and inadvertently

719
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:15,120
give you those thoughts logins and

720
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:17,760
passwords because you are much more

721
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:21,589
competent than he is he doesn't have

722
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:30,750
time or desires to get into it cognitive

723
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:33,630
distortions I like to people have

724
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:36,750
propensity to agree to something if they

725
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:38,580
first decline something for instance you

726
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:40,410
ask them would you please tell me your

727
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:43,500
login and password well at least until

728
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:46,109
Morgan he'll say all right first time he

729
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:50,250
says no second time he will say yes once

730
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:51,870
you get along in login then then you'll

731
00:40:50,250 --> 00:41:01,500
just get the password there are many

732
00:40:51,870 --> 00:41:10,830
ways of this sensory overload methods of

733
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:14,480
social engineering some payloads

734
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:18,029
like a mirror Society website mirrors

735
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:23,480
infected documents or if we use them

736
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:23,480
another infect a flash drives

737
00:41:26,779 --> 00:41:35,099
should be inserted social engineering

738
00:41:32,759 --> 00:41:37,109
expert cannot do it as they asked their

739
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:39,809
plastics are they they are their policy

740
00:41:37,109 --> 00:41:41,369
and then pretext again legend says you

741
00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:46,470
will get the legend collect information

742
00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:48,630
and if you or have some kind of fun

743
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:51,450
skills of an actor you can pretend to be

744
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:55,259
technical support role but usually when

745
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:59,480
you collect all the information you need

746
00:41:55,259 --> 00:42:02,509
less of acting and more actual knowledge

747
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:06,749
mentioning the systems and other things

748
00:42:02,509 --> 00:42:12,619
and understanding how it works as I told

749
00:42:06,749 --> 00:42:12,618
you if you study physical security

750
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:20,819
understanding the employers behavior is

751
00:42:16,019 --> 00:42:33,839
important it will help you in life it's

752
00:42:20,819 --> 00:42:35,519
enough to a very a very nice pretext

753
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:37,950
they feel come to the car let's say I'm

754
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:40,890
going to the canteen they say all right

755
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:44,460
if you get to the office canteen

756
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:48,180
go ahead proceed and you just keep going

757
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:53,130
you need to have a pretext and if you

758
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:55,578
protect the solitary you may make it for

759
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:55,579
instance

760
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:02,230
if you take a big box empty box or

761
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:05,140
something unimportant in it and you keep

762
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:08,350
going to what you need and you know that

763
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:10,509
all doors will open for you you take

764
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:13,299
something and just walk as people will

765
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:16,720
talk because they see you have a heavy

766
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:18,850
big box if a person doesn't want to help

767
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:27,970
you carry he will at least over the

768
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:32,770
doors informational collection social

769
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:35,529
engineering is self sufficient because

770
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:38,050
when you talk to people you'll get the

771
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:43,710
necessary links and connections to other

772
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:47,110
people it's useful and allows you

773
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:54,850
fishing certainly it's clear several

774
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:57,490
directions if you collected some

775
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:59,970
information a deficient stage you can

776
00:43:57,490 --> 00:44:03,640
turn to a specific to an individual

777
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:07,569
knowing about him for instance we've

778
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:09,940
sent them and we may and we get

779
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:13,330
information that some employees are on

780
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:15,220
vacation and they recommend to turn to

781
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:17,650
their subordinates and then you call a

782
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:22,859
subordinate and you say you speak on

783
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:22,860
behalf of his boss voice phishing yes

784
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:28,750
shaking heads a page that steals your

785
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:33,700
quick-quick

786
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:39,100
when the user tries to do something but

787
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:41,549
it says it's a checking page and then

788
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,549
the user

789
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:56,299
Road Apple is it joke like how mine you

790
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:58,190
know in fact a physical device or flash

791
00:44:56,300 --> 00:45:00,770
drive that you can leave in a coffee

792
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:06,950
shop or whatever employees will just

793
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:08,540
take it and insert and get a bu USB

794
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:11,330
attack or something like that then we

795
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:13,940
get access to his machine and then you

796
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:16,819
know what we had such cases talked about

797
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:18,890
across here and then reverse social

798
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:22,010
engineering and we didn't have such

799
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:25,370
cases we had all authors we never use

800
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:33,560
such methods about a still it it it's

801
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:35,720
worth and just create situation where a

802
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:40,040
user won't turn to you for help for

803
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:42,910
instance a secretary has a sticker with

804
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:45,350
a whole number of a technical support

805
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:48,160
engineer you just change the whole

806
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:51,350
number and you expect the quality and

807
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:55,160
things like that are quite just

808
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:59,230
practical and finally we have come to

809
00:45:55,160 --> 00:46:03,740
the cases I mentioned before let us

810
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:15,710
consider them it's time for night

811
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:18,589
bedtime stories we needed two chances in

812
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:20,800
information security what you see on the

813
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:20,800
right

814
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:33,420
we imagine this system administrator

815
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:35,880
doesn't work well but he would just send

816
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:40,130
out his logins and password I called him

817
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:42,509
by Skype like with a plug-in that

818
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:47,209
reports the conversation and then I

819
00:46:42,509 --> 00:46:49,439
spoke to him I reported with a document

820
00:46:47,209 --> 00:46:52,919
with his answers

821
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:58,279
in fact he turned out to be quite lazy

822
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:58,279
but not very irresponsible so i

823
00:46:58,429 --> 00:47:07,739
consecutively came back to the matters

824
00:47:04,049 --> 00:47:09,809
of interest to me he disclosed much

825
00:47:07,739 --> 00:47:13,259
information some technical experts

826
00:47:09,809 --> 00:47:15,719
whatever references to some internal

827
00:47:13,259 --> 00:47:19,859
documents and names of departments who

828
00:47:15,719 --> 00:47:24,420
do this or that IP address for

829
00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:27,449
connection but still no confidential

830
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:30,989
information and he did it very very

831
00:47:27,449 --> 00:47:34,499
funny way the argument first there or it

832
00:47:30,989 --> 00:47:36,479
takes time to checker and someone should

833
00:47:34,499 --> 00:47:38,879
there you know alone it is time for if

834
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:41,368
he has no time or he knows nothing and

835
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,799
you have to go to his boss so whatever

836
00:47:41,369 --> 00:47:47,249
was forbidden with fight for her

837
00:47:43,799 --> 00:47:49,819
policies he never mentioned still at

838
00:47:47,249 --> 00:47:51,988
this stage I collected information

839
00:47:49,819 --> 00:47:54,719
provided to the customers of the

840
00:47:51,989 --> 00:47:56,610
customer she was not impressed probably

841
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:58,670
to be impressed with the results

842
00:47:56,610 --> 00:48:04,429
[Music]

843
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:04,429
the test was suspended and we

844
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:40,310
decided the administrator thing so we

845
00:48:29,599 --> 00:49:00,500
developed a new checking we got access

846
00:48:40,310 --> 00:49:06,369
to administrator withhold was not very

847
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:06,369
attentive about the security structures

848
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:14,980
it's a state company classified

849
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:18,890
manufacturing and we wanted to audit the

850
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:20,900
security information security

851
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:23,750
I mentioned this case and my previous

852
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:26,290
presentation but we can consider in

853
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:30,349
detail into social engineering because

854
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:33,079
there was there were two hearts social

855
00:49:30,349 --> 00:49:35,839
as an earring and technical part we

856
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:39,940
gathered information about the people

857
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:44,930
and the company and we prepared some

858
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:46,440
additional materials or two letters this

859
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:49,710
is a website

860
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:52,200
under Santa that are you we caught it

861
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:58,349
beside the style certainly we had

862
00:49:52,200 --> 00:50:02,759
nothing to do with this newspapers it

863
00:49:58,349 --> 00:50:06,030
was a malicious site we used we

864
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:19,950
concocted this side for this case we

865
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:23,369
sent out two messages as a message about

866
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:28,618
our parking spaces and near the officer

867
00:50:23,369 --> 00:50:31,829
so many people got interested in both

868
00:50:28,619 --> 00:50:35,069
pieces of information out of the forty

869
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:39,030
four letters seventeen activated the

870
00:50:35,069 --> 00:50:46,200
week three of them actually got

871
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:47,640
suspicious suspicious and that we but

872
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:52,020
but it didn't help

873
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:56,460
we got access to four people out of

874
00:50:52,020 --> 00:51:00,049
seventeen and acting regional director

875
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:04,109
and accountant and to project managers

876
00:51:00,049 --> 00:51:06,569
the information security service did not

877
00:51:04,109 --> 00:51:11,960
discover this attacked and they did not

878
00:51:06,569 --> 00:51:11,960
fix it so mess

879
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:18,660
mass mass mailing interesting case I did

880
00:51:16,739 --> 00:51:24,239
not participate but I was happy to read

881
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:26,729
the reports there was a number of social

882
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:38,309
engineering tools and search for

883
00:51:26,729 --> 00:51:41,160
information in employees we did the

884
00:51:38,309 --> 00:51:45,779
mailing and out the information

885
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:54,328
gathering stage we found people in 51

886
00:51:45,779 --> 00:51:57,479
email address we studied a website of a

887
00:51:54,329 --> 00:52:02,099
customers and thus the configuration was

888
00:51:57,479 --> 00:52:04,799
wrong we got 3,000 email addresses of

889
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:11,130
those people were selected 1000 and sent

890
00:52:04,799 --> 00:52:16,489
letters and out of them 350 used our

891
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:27,839
links and tried to input their data

892
00:52:16,489 --> 00:52:29,219
actually it was monkeys a portal where

893
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:32,369
the people were supposed to be

894
00:52:29,219 --> 00:52:35,959
authorized and wonderful scenarios

895
00:52:32,369 --> 00:52:35,959
happened so

896
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:49,370
so the attacker was studying the hobbies

897
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:52,250
and interests of the employees as

898
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:54,740
someone was doing embroidery someone was

899
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:57,500
listening to smokey then the attacker

900
00:52:54,740 --> 00:53:04,669
was supposed to prepare an individual

901
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:09,740
letter of an employee so the employee

902
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:15,950
would click the link just uses a hobby

903
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:18,799
to get infected the customer did not

904
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:24,520
appreciate our idea and this research

905
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:28,160
was not done but it it was a good idea

906
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:33,250
it went and told the annual report so

907
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:33,250
insurance company and a checking

908
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:42,109
education of the employees we needed

909
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:45,770
many tests Oh cinta was used to analyze

910
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:48,950
the groups in social networks there were

911
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:52,330
55 totally we discovered groups that

912
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:56,419
could be used by the program attract

913
00:53:52,330 --> 00:54:06,680
attackers for black PR or collecting

914
00:53:56,420 --> 00:54:10,610
information and then we performed a

915
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:15,529
phishing attack in the first sampling we

916
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:19,340
had 100 in the second 170 dresses with

917
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:24,370
different purposes first the purpose of

918
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:27,950
getting the data of employees and

919
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:30,880
checking the reaction to the file and

920
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:33,899
closed out of 100 addresses as some

921
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:39,450
turned out

922
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:41,849
but out of 6414 read and tried to open

923
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:48,240
the enclosed documents that turned out

924
00:54:41,849 --> 00:54:53,420
to be infected so in the other mailing

925
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:57,209
we had 106 that we had 77 addresses and

926
00:54:53,420 --> 00:55:01,170
18 people opened those letters and

927
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:05,789
wanted to the link and out of them six

928
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:07,950
Winterthur the link and entered some

929
00:55:05,789 --> 00:55:15,950
their ID data

930
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:19,500
so actually we see from the statistics

931
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:21,598
that actually approximately one-third

932
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:24,869
that all the employees are usually

933
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:27,839
susceptible note wishing opposed there

934
00:55:24,869 --> 00:55:29,819
were four scenarios of attack according

935
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:34,710
to two models who were trying to call

936
00:55:29,819 --> 00:55:40,230
and request information from the people

937
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:42,839
who resigned or we tried to introduce

938
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:50,880
ourselves as employees and all their

939
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:58,220
mobile phones out on 2104 numbers we got

940
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:58,220
seven answers and 14 employees replied

941
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:04,960
so that was the statistics original

942
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:07,790
offices of the company we got some

943
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:10,130
rejected by the rejections but in some

944
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:16,040
cases we got the information that we

945
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:18,320
requested or additional information one

946
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:20,450
of the employees was very summery who

947
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:23,570
couldn't help because he was not at his

948
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:25,520
job place but for mr. callback so tell

949
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:29,300
us all the information that reversed

950
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:32,150
social engineering but we had very

951
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:34,160
stringent timing and we decided to stop

952
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:54,500
because we certainly could get more

953
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:57,049
phone numbers and Falls so most of the

954
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:59,060
large companies in Wisconsin P another

955
00:56:57,050 --> 00:57:01,600
secret you know you know the office

956
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:17,210
address and some other cities that we

957
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:19,460
actually is there trust between you and

958
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:23,600
I don't know

959
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:27,220
no trustful Trust trust English so an

960
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:30,520
employee's actually was very helpful and

961
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:35,209
he promised to help us in many ways and

962
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:37,820
there is a probability that actually he

963
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:41,450
understood and he was trying to get our

964
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:48,580
trust to understand who is behind it but

965
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:51,980
not really it did not happen let's

966
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:54,980
finish it my colleagues certainly want

967
00:57:51,980 --> 00:58:01,490
to speak and the next case were the

968
00:57:54,980 --> 00:58:04,850
thousand of salespeople and we have

969
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:13,100
screenshots of the messages we sent out

970
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:16,730
and this suspicious Word document and we

971
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:23,299
made a number of we made exercise in air

972
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:28,970
silt and filters nature we found a file

973
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:33,770
with a list of 34,000 employees of the

974
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:36,730
company that would allow to make an epic

975
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:41,440
fishing mailing but we decided not to

976
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:45,800
overdo it and made only two including

977
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:48,890
one hundred and three hundred random

978
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:52,850
addresses which gave us relevant

979
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:56,210
statistics of that searches three people

980
00:58:52,850 --> 00:58:59,960
opened the letters and fifteen actually

981
00:58:56,210 --> 00:59:02,960
clicked the link and entered their data

982
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:04,820
and went through the fall and and told

983
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:07,100
what they like what they don't like on

984
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:09,200
the company and told about the product

985
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:11,569
there were many questions and they

986
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:14,169
dutifully replied it was very sweet of

987
00:59:11,570 --> 00:59:17,020
them to atone

988
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:24,960
of us hackers like that and in the

989
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:24,960
second the mailing over 50% succumbed to

990
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:34,240
temptation and some of them tried to

991
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:37,300
open it wouldn't open 108 attempt so

992
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:41,169
people kept trying to open and several

993
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:43,120
people answered and actually asked to

994
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:48,190
resend the document because it wouldn't

995
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:52,839
open we didn't do it so that's all for

996
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:55,810
my cases and let me just recap about the

997
00:59:52,840 --> 01:00:03,090
method or tool combat social engineering

998
00:59:55,810 --> 01:00:06,090
so you have the exhaustive list of

999
01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:06,090
measures

1000
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:18,250
[Applause]

1001
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:20,740
thank you for your presentation I have a

1002
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:26,980
question how much time does it take to

1003
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:29,439
prepare on average er to this session

1004
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:32,410
attack with no social engineering I

1005
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:34,780
don't mean technical making technical

1006
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:39,370
material so first rise but the planning

1007
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:44,770
of the concept and further usually one

1008
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:51,029
day so usually we gather information for

1009
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:51,030
a weekend just a case it takes one day a

1010
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:57,870
week for to gather information and buy

1011
01:00:55,270 --> 01:01:00,600
obscene and Kontest messages sometimes

1012
01:00:57,870 --> 01:01:03,230
because pin test part may be high

1013
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:06,500
[Music]

1014
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:09,020
we find some necessary information just

1015
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:10,940
by chance and planing is not very

1016
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:12,740
difficult on the other hand the date

1017
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:15,800
case with insurance company was a

1018
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:19,250
challenge because I personally have no

1019
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:23,030
idea how insurance companies work except

1020
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:59,240
you know defrauding people from their

1021
01:01:23,030 --> 01:02:09,200
money I spoke to my first Maxim

1022
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:14,959
but episode very short question three

1023
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:18,259
questions short ones and legality and of

1024
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:21,020
your scanning you come to a new plugged

1025
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:22,849
in get in touch with your team and ask

1026
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:25,660
him the difference between social

1027
01:02:22,849 --> 01:02:28,670
engineering and technical engineering

1028
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:32,930
because it's judging by the text or your

1029
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:35,450
presentation is the same thing social

1030
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:38,118
technical engineering it's kind of

1031
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:40,939
constructive both and I've never come

1032
01:02:38,119 --> 01:02:43,670
across I can assume the social

1033
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:46,880
engineering does not require technical

1034
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:48,740
means but we do social or social

1035
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:52,790
technical engineer because we do have

1036
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:53,649
technical remains technical gadgets yeah

1037
01:02:52,790 --> 01:02:57,520
thank you

1038
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:57,520
and the third question

1039
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:04,329
so how do you know that you are not an

1040
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:07,680
object of testing yourself so when they

1041
01:03:04,329 --> 01:03:12,460
invited you because I have not developed

1042
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:18,819
information because I had some some

1043
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:20,559
information that I was ready to share I

1044
01:03:18,819 --> 01:03:24,040
thought they were just offered a lot of

1045
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:25,630
money but they didn't and so that's why

1046
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:28,930
I did not tell them any more than

1047
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:32,520
expected them to ask me more I was ready

1048
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:32,520
to tell them there's no suspicion

1049
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:42,309
question have you ever done that inside

1050
01:03:38,170 --> 01:03:43,809
your company such test if you if you did

1051
01:03:42,309 --> 01:03:52,180
so what the results are

1052
01:03:43,809 --> 01:03:55,799
I need to give the floor to our

1053
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:58,299
marketing manager discussions yeah

1054
01:03:55,799 --> 01:04:01,359
because specific certain a lives an

1055
01:03:58,299 --> 01:04:04,299
imprint that's true the specifics is

1056
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:06,848
different everywhere and I know that in

1057
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:08,710
my own experience everything the parents

1058
01:04:06,849 --> 01:04:11,410
are specific people are the skills and

1059
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:14,710
and professionalism that they never

1060
01:04:11,410 --> 01:04:17,049
asked have interviews so there could be

1061
01:04:14,710 --> 01:04:19,150
the company one of the processes are bad

1062
01:04:17,049 --> 01:04:22,660
and there is no security and there could

1063
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:25,000
be different company that sells sugar or

1064
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:32,879
stories there is a good example that

1065
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:38,039
there is a place for grocery and

1066
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:41,130
so then the former the former KGB KGB

1067
01:04:38,039 --> 01:04:43,410
guy just came as security guy physical

1068
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:47,220
security guy and he immediately checked

1069
01:04:43,410 --> 01:04:51,509
the cameras and and then he and then he

1070
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:56,970
puts out his own a secret secret cameras

1071
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:58,920
and then everything in every never got

1072
01:04:56,970 --> 01:05:01,379
no milk so there was a camera that he

1073
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:03,720
secretly installed and then he realized

1074
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:05,160
that everyone is stealing and since they

1075
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:08,839
could not afford to have everyone

1076
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:08,839
stealing there they fired him

1077
01:05:15,349 --> 01:05:39,680
Thank You Maxime great presentation as

1078
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:47,769
usual cyber cyber training lots of send

1079
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:50,899
boxes for hackers - so there's a few

1080
01:05:47,769 --> 01:05:54,430
sandboxes where the defenders make

1081
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:59,240
practice so there's my eyes or gaze of

1082
01:05:54,430 --> 01:06:09,890
how we approached this solution and what

1083
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:20,660
came of it thank you for coming cyber

1084
01:06:09,890 --> 01:06:25,868
training less technical cases that we'll

1085
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:29,779
talk about later what is cyber training

1086
01:06:25,869 --> 01:06:34,849
so lots of companies there's a Wolford

1087
01:06:29,779 --> 01:06:39,920
cyber training and so we can easily come

1088
01:06:34,849 --> 01:06:42,740
across CTF for company then purchased

1089
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:46,509
Ayana business games different companies

1090
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:50,950
so what's this is all about let's see

1091
01:06:46,509 --> 01:06:53,289
yes I burr is associated with

1092
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:55,970
information technologies and computers

1093
01:06:53,289 --> 01:06:59,420
that's the first line of associations

1094
01:06:55,970 --> 01:07:04,069
and the word should be obvious that

1095
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:07,029
cyber training isn't is an event where

1096
01:07:04,069 --> 01:07:10,140
by different people trying to get

1097
01:07:07,029 --> 01:07:16,110
require skills

1098
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:20,080
related to IT information security

1099
01:07:16,110 --> 01:07:21,640
information security so roll games this

1100
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:30,819
business games let's let's talk about

1101
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:34,500
business games what type of training can

1102
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:37,990
give us let's say so then business games

1103
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:42,130
so this event this format whereby the

1104
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:45,819
teacher talks which is without any

1105
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:49,090
technical means questions prepared

1106
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:53,020
beforehand and the teams and the people

1107
01:07:49,090 --> 01:08:01,540
directly try to answer sure their

1108
01:07:53,020 --> 01:08:05,340
knowledge and advantages so very not

1109
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:07,660
costly questions prepared beforehand

1110
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:10,540
what are the weaknesses it's only

1111
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:19,899
serious your theoretical knowledge that

1112
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:27,640
cannot be applied the number of trainees

1113
01:08:19,899 --> 01:08:32,080
is limited by the audience typical

1114
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:37,990
example would be I'd say the questions

1115
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:40,840
that have to do with so what means we

1116
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:44,500
can use for example they at what means

1117
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:48,210
we can use to to grab the domain

1118
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:51,100
controller to capture it

1119
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:54,490
and then so then they exchange opinions

1120
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:57,400
discuss it and then they say yes or not

1121
01:08:54,490 --> 01:08:59,170
and then they get score certain score

1122
01:08:57,399 --> 01:09:06,580
for that

1123
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:10,730
get ones and move over to other events

1124
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:17,899
we need certain technical units so those

1125
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:21,589
are the events where people can get

1126
01:09:17,899 --> 01:09:24,740
together so there is a teacher computer

1127
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:28,340
and network infrastructure and then the

1128
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:32,779
sodium means of attack identification

1129
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:37,340
the samples of traffic etc and so where

1130
01:09:32,779 --> 01:09:44,809
you send videos to so they're the

1131
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:48,260
specialists trying to find those using

1132
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:54,620
using their rules I can figure out what

1133
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:59,950
happened to the network lots of

1134
01:09:54,620 --> 01:10:06,010
different sense of network traffic

1135
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:06,010
samples of other abilities so you don't

1136
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:13,520
we need to professionally train the

1137
01:10:10,490 --> 01:10:17,330
attackers at the same time and then they

1138
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:19,850
just no need to know how

1139
01:10:17,330 --> 01:10:21,500
so then how it works and how the

1140
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:25,330
response to different events and

1141
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:28,880
explained the participants what happens

1142
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:31,340
and the witnesses and the traffic is

1143
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:35,690
always the same because it's been

1144
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:42,980
prepared beforehand and the scenarios

1145
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:48,259
are quite company complex lots of yeah

1146
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:50,500
the third type is so then captures of

1147
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:50,500
luck

1148
01:10:50,880 --> 01:11:18,910
we will prepare people to participate

1149
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:30,970
there trying to address the issue and

1150
01:11:18,910 --> 01:11:41,710
resolve resolve what advantages that

1151
01:11:30,970 --> 01:11:45,850
they get the tasks they will not get any

1152
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:47,650
new knowledge they see how it's done

1153
01:11:45,850 --> 01:11:54,460
because everything is done on local

1154
01:11:47,650 --> 01:11:59,769
machine this is the biggest and the

1155
01:11:54,460 --> 01:12:04,540
third example is so there's a big

1156
01:11:59,770 --> 01:12:08,140
infrastructure which is created we have

1157
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:12,130
defenders monitoring attackers everyone

1158
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:13,770
different means the gadgets where widows

1159
01:12:12,130 --> 01:12:19,180
and the attacker

1160
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:26,800
trying to torture and the defenders

1161
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:29,410
identify them and to counteract the

1162
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:31,360
reality this is almost combat so that

1163
01:12:29,410 --> 01:12:35,559
I'm a technologist different means of

1164
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:39,990
identification response so then they

1165
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:39,990
touch on always complex always unique

1166
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:47,980
lots of means lots of equipment is

1167
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:51,970
required and many teams should

1168
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:54,610
participate and then the attack

1169
01:12:51,970 --> 01:13:00,190
scenarios depend on the skills of the

1170
01:12:54,610 --> 01:13:02,160
participants attackers and sometimes

1171
01:13:00,190 --> 01:13:20,049
they cannot always display their skills

1172
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:40,720
because he first so others these are the

1173
01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:43,930
main types over to Sergei and our

1174
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:47,020
presentations because they know that we

1175
01:13:43,930 --> 01:13:48,820
talk about new techniques of attacks but

1176
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:52,450
we talk about something else today I

1177
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:58,290
have friends that the highly motivated

1178
01:13:52,450 --> 01:14:00,970
they're saying that some kind of a

1179
01:13:58,290 --> 01:14:03,460
certain team of people are interested in

1180
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:05,800
something and they're so interested so

1181
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:10,720
they're creative and normative and their

1182
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:14,350
role is this team like that but when I

1183
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:16,780
did fantastic so because we always do

1184
01:14:14,350 --> 01:14:18,880
the same thing because I so we know the

1185
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:21,730
variability even other types of attacks

1186
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:23,710
so but what is it that we know to

1187
01:14:21,730 --> 01:14:26,620
develop something unique that will want

1188
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:29,560
will make you one stay longer at at your

1189
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:32,170
work and everything where is it that we

1190
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:34,360
cannot be operated and the rate cannot

1191
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:36,970
do the first without ever have

1192
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:42,639
so we decided just to combine our skills

1193
01:14:36,970 --> 01:14:48,940
and we turned it into cyber training

1194
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:53,470
cyber cyber cyber cyber polygon so cyber

1195
01:14:48,940 --> 01:14:57,580
polygon is a platform or or chair where

1196
01:14:53,470 --> 01:15:01,090
we can do cyber training cyber cyber

1197
01:14:57,580 --> 01:15:03,430
training and so then we concentrated on

1198
01:15:01,090 --> 01:15:06,340
the skills designed for the people who

1199
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:09,820
were consult and and data centers or in

1200
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:12,910
data centers so this is designed for

1201
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:15,549
them and then we thought so we have C

1202
01:15:12,910 --> 01:15:17,440
TAS we have business games we talked

1203
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:20,500
about all the projects the theoretical

1204
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:23,349
aspects by the customer the people it

1205
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:25,180
will be much more convenient just not to

1206
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:29,950
come just once a year ought to have a

1207
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:34,510
program that could actually get

1208
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:37,780
information about any set of protection

1209
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:40,600
and to teach the employees have to deal

1210
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:43,300
with these means of protection and the

1211
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:46,590
teacher doesn't have to have the skills

1212
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:49,660
of a tester or or an attacker

1213
01:15:46,590 --> 01:15:52,300
it's a sufficient just to launch -

1214
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:55,599
launch the bad guy and the attacker and

1215
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:59,560
all by itself like that attack domain

1216
01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:02,620
controller our just amazing whatever so

1217
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:06,340
then it's quite possible so with the

1218
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:09,980
help of his infrastructure that was the

1219
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:12,740
first requirement of product

1220
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:16,450
and there so then the first the second

1221
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:21,559
one is not only repeated nature not

1222
01:16:16,450 --> 01:16:27,920
variability repeatability and so they

1223
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:30,020
have scats different departments and so

1224
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:32,630
they don't get in touch with each other

1225
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:35,390
but they need to be trained so they

1226
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:38,620
don't touch base and so we need to teach

1227
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:41,300
them how to find how to identify and

1228
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:44,480
after you listen those computer actions

1229
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:49,130
this right we decided to bring on this

1230
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:54,200
new notion of templates so every every

1231
01:16:49,130 --> 01:16:56,510
teacher you can select one can attack

1232
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:59,570
scripts or just another tablet with

1233
01:16:56,510 --> 01:17:02,090
other one let say a template it's not

1234
01:16:59,570 --> 01:17:04,969
one being when you realize that could be

1235
01:17:02,090 --> 01:17:07,490
up to a hundred the amps is connected

1236
01:17:04,970 --> 01:17:16,910
together and that lives in my ecosystem

1237
01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:19,160
and apples the separation and so they

1238
01:17:16,910 --> 01:17:21,769
disagree why I do love the more than the

1239
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:25,730
world because a southern staying at home

1240
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:27,710
that you can open up for Sarah and do

1241
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:30,200
the online training immediately no

1242
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:33,410
problem so this way we have to have a

1243
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:44,540
teacher and groups and so that's one one

1244
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:49,300
temperature different data centers using

1245
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:49,300
different templates to do their training

1246
01:17:50,019 --> 01:18:00,829
and thus we made this list of automated

1247
01:17:55,909 --> 01:18:03,619
attacks multiple simultaneous trainings

1248
01:18:00,829 --> 01:18:05,750
can be done on-site and remote idli

1249
01:18:03,619 --> 01:18:12,018
their personalized trainings various

1250
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:13,909
attack vectors and their ability to put

1251
01:18:12,019 --> 01:18:17,329
your own miss current in danger so let

1252
01:18:13,909 --> 01:18:19,759
him act his are allowed and then the

1253
01:18:17,329 --> 01:18:24,259
infrastructure is customer customizable

1254
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:27,079
the most important automatic so the

1255
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:29,409
authorities the miss cancel each script

1256
01:18:27,079 --> 01:18:31,940
can be repeated no it will be different

1257
01:18:29,409 --> 01:18:35,480
each time because all the actions

1258
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:40,070
related to skin hydration so they keep

1259
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:44,959
changing and it's all random and this is

1260
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:51,768
a repeatable attack scenarios and then

1261
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:54,579
either use for training you want just

1262
01:18:51,769 --> 01:19:00,079
account current visitors of power both

1263
01:18:54,579 --> 01:19:05,449
both what we have done we have done this

1264
01:19:00,079 --> 01:19:08,570
platform empire star far from stand

1265
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:11,808
office can visited so we demonstrate our

1266
01:19:08,570 --> 01:19:14,239
our system that is provided a feature

1267
01:19:11,809 --> 01:19:16,219
that launches very quickly we can run

1268
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:19,539
our abilities any scenarios where

1269
01:19:16,219 --> 01:19:26,239
incident cards response teams and

1270
01:19:19,539 --> 01:19:30,050
remedies other so then there is a remedy

1271
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:32,869
has a means of protection that you can

1272
01:19:30,050 --> 01:19:34,909
use and those cards we have to start the

1273
01:19:32,869 --> 01:19:37,150
car so that can respond quickly to such

1274
01:19:34,909 --> 01:19:37,150
incidents

1275
01:20:37,790 --> 01:20:40,920
[Music]

1276
01:20:56,010 --> 01:21:11,969
then to make sure that presentation and

1277
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:14,969
infrastructure the first problem was

1278
01:21:11,969 --> 01:21:14,969
identified

1279
01:21:20,920 --> 01:22:32,890
SH upside down work maybe that position

1280
01:22:34,570 --> 01:22:44,710
that can be can do several drinks at the

1281
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:44,710
same time isolated

1282
01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:45,630
physical gauges cloning of templates on

1283
01:23:38,620 --> 01:23:45,630
physical thank you thank you questions

1284
01:23:51,030 --> 01:23:56,700
thank you my name is Adan I represent

1285
01:23:53,980 --> 01:24:00,120
the Russian technological university

1286
01:23:56,700 --> 01:24:06,150
very much interested to train students

1287
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:06,150
how do you interact with the students

1288
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:15,370
included as part of the course maybe we

1289
01:24:12,190 --> 01:24:19,150
need to initiate an attack so that the

1290
01:24:15,370 --> 01:24:21,790
students would identify and monitor it

1291
01:24:19,150 --> 01:24:24,280
and protect themselves from it so that

1292
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:27,160
they could imitate their own a few so we

1293
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:29,800
need just here to train the testers is

1294
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:32,400
very important you know that four would

1295
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:32,400
be just fine

1296
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:43,660
all right so we're having because you as

1297
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:47,500
a feature you need to sell the materials

1298
01:24:43,660 --> 01:25:05,590
and so we trained ourselves and we train

1299
01:24:47,500 --> 01:25:11,530
the trainer's people from the staff then

1300
01:25:05,590 --> 01:25:17,950
the paper security the first time so I

1301
01:25:11,530 --> 01:25:21,370
guess what is the cool injection is

1302
01:25:17,950 --> 01:25:24,809
trying to fix QX and after should check

1303
01:25:21,370 --> 01:25:28,570
I fixed it to say thank you because now

1304
01:25:24,810 --> 01:25:31,900
as the head of this time sure look

1305
01:25:28,570 --> 01:25:34,240
different with half those set of threads

1306
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:36,670
and because it's very good approach that

1307
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:39,099
it will lead to people's eyes opening

1308
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:54,880
understanding the importance of of this

1309
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:56,890
topic to properly learn can you add to

1310
01:25:54,880 --> 01:26:01,330
confuse it you have to bring it closer

1311
01:25:56,890 --> 01:26:08,350
to and our system allows so these noises

1312
01:26:01,330 --> 01:26:11,050
they exist by themselves and then there

1313
01:26:08,350 --> 01:26:17,350
are scripts that imitate the activities

1314
01:26:11,050 --> 01:26:19,900
of the user through selenium browser

1315
01:26:17,350 --> 01:26:23,350
they way they download so that you don't

1316
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:27,639
go to one s1c so they just in it and

1317
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:30,070
they imitate the traffic they will need

1318
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:32,590
to put in some more noise in the form of

1319
01:26:30,070 --> 01:26:33,898
attack centers in ideas the attack is

1320
01:26:32,590 --> 01:26:35,399
not same

1321
01:26:33,899 --> 01:26:37,289
that's given they have the ideas to

1322
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:40,349
figure gate you don't see them very

1323
01:26:37,289 --> 01:26:42,419
special take your press and then and

1324
01:26:40,349 --> 01:26:44,249
then you get to surfing as a user agent

1325
01:26:42,419 --> 01:26:46,648
search that so then there's all this

1326
01:26:44,249 --> 01:26:49,228
attached so they're never that eighteen

1327
01:26:46,649 --> 01:26:51,439
thousand events blow up immediately and

1328
01:26:49,229 --> 01:26:55,110
they're so this is and the students task

1329
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:57,599
is to understand is true if the first

1330
01:26:55,110 --> 01:27:00,030
point was web portal it could not be

1331
01:26:57,599 --> 01:27:02,789
done DMZ to the to the internal network

1332
01:27:00,030 --> 01:27:13,768
the sugar self connection he needs to

1333
01:27:02,789 --> 01:27:16,849
build this network second we have

1334
01:27:13,769 --> 01:27:20,300
developed all scripts of all the times

1335
01:27:16,849 --> 01:27:22,739
developed on the basis of our dentists

1336
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:25,909
penetration tests and so some approaches

1337
01:27:22,739 --> 01:27:34,049
at least back then and then FTP

1338
01:27:25,909 --> 01:27:38,098
vulnerabilities you can do so then we

1339
01:27:34,050 --> 01:27:40,709
work from the outside segment so outside

1340
01:27:38,099 --> 01:27:43,699
Mistral totally down to the domain

1341
01:27:40,709 --> 01:27:47,188
controller then we have the scripts of

1342
01:27:43,699 --> 01:27:49,949
in-house miss Cranston so from the

1343
01:27:47,189 --> 01:27:52,199
developer they attack this segment of

1344
01:27:49,949 --> 01:27:54,348
accounting office for example so we do

1345
01:27:52,199 --> 01:27:54,348
that

1346
01:28:00,870 --> 01:28:12,540
thank you that technically cyber what

1347
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:14,790
kind of side the desire to use sorry if

1348
01:28:12,540 --> 01:28:19,140
developers do not pristine only five

1349
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:20,070
persons I'm not going to go around the

1350
01:28:19,140 --> 01:28:22,790
sushi Agra

1351
01:28:20,070 --> 01:28:25,349
so whether you are a new stadium so

1352
01:28:22,790 --> 01:28:26,880
virtualization questions to her had to

1353
01:28:25,350 --> 01:28:29,460
heal because you'll talk to you because

1354
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:31,170
I am responsible for the developing and

1355
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:34,340
for the attack scripts that's why I

1356
01:28:31,170 --> 01:28:34,340
cannot answer this question

1357
01:28:43,810 --> 01:28:48,260
good afternoon

1358
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:48,260
[Music]

1359
01:28:48,580 --> 01:28:54,980
so not Romanian so you can borrow

1360
01:28:51,590 --> 01:28:59,449
britain from many vendors to put it into

1361
01:28:54,980 --> 01:29:03,769
play so as long as it receives traffic

1362
01:28:59,449 --> 01:29:08,299
so i can use any hardware you do that

1363
01:29:03,770 --> 01:29:21,980
only on FFTs were tested on security

1364
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:26,599
onion we have not yet tested it on paid

1365
01:29:21,980 --> 01:29:31,369
products and only on free products so in

1366
01:29:26,599 --> 01:29:32,989
your in your in your questions so if

1367
01:29:31,369 --> 01:29:35,839
it's a paid product so the only problem

1368
01:29:32,989 --> 01:29:39,110
to test is probably with license but you

1369
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:40,699
can always agree about the the terms of

1370
01:29:39,110 --> 01:29:43,610
the license so that we could bring it

1371
01:29:40,699 --> 01:29:45,409
into play and test it for penetration as

1372
01:29:43,610 --> 01:29:48,619
well even if it's your license flourish

1373
01:29:45,409 --> 01:29:51,619
like checkpoint you know that can be

1374
01:29:48,619 --> 01:29:54,409
downloaded and then used use again to

1375
01:29:51,619 --> 01:29:57,170
which later I don't think a little cyber

1376
01:29:54,409 --> 01:29:59,629
training I said because here set up this

1377
01:29:57,170 --> 01:30:02,420
cyber training in virtualization and

1378
01:29:59,630 --> 01:30:06,170
once you have done so you'll be doing so

1379
01:30:02,420 --> 01:30:09,770
today is using one-time template you

1380
01:30:06,170 --> 01:30:12,230
turn it off and then it erases or can't

1381
01:30:09,770 --> 01:30:14,840
we can store it if you want you can save

1382
01:30:12,230 --> 01:30:19,989
it so then then I can use it later if

1383
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:19,989
you don't erase it thank you for coming
