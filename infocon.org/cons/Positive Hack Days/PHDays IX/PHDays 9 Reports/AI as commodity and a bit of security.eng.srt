00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,450
dobroe utro colleagues possible stow

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:10,200
personalistic random thank you for

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:14,670
waking so early my name is Sergey garlic

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:19,890
I live in Dubai work in Abu Dhabi and I

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:24,150
teach at the University Harbor space in

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:28,080
Barcelona and and I participate in the

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:31,439
program conference so then I used to be

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:35,129
involved in security I was very close as

9
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,620
the pen tests I did as well organised

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,530
friend hunting was the technologist

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:45,000
Kaspersky but now as I changed my

12
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:49,440
profile and I I do not do much of

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,129
security and I do physical security in

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,519
the wider sense of the world and then

15
00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:58,730
and I would like to talk I would like to

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:04,320
talk about AI and machine learning and

17
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:06,330
its condition and status and but kind of

18
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:10,020
products we have and to ask you some

19
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:13,439
questions because for me this is

20
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,479
something new and and so there are more

21
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,990
questions for me than answers so let's

22
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:23,820
let's think what many people understand

23
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:26,369
by a AI about machine learning and so

24
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,579
there is this picture and famous

25
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:35,310
carefully a famous picture who published

26
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:38,030
a book recently on the war of AI between

27
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,860
China and the United States and

28
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:44,990
according to his classifications or

29
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:48,979
development of AI is goes in four ways

30
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:51,839
internal data than business automation

31
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:56,670
then digitalization of the physical

32
00:01:51,840 --> 00:02:01,799
world and then autonomous AI and I think

33
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:04,189
that so these ideas are probably it's a

34
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,890
kind of short-term thinking and

35
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:10,579
because he doesn't look strategically at

36
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:15,349
these things and the statistics say that

37
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:17,110
machine learning and AI so we know but

38
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:21,130
know that this is part of deep learning

39
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:24,940
on the other scale there are visionaries

40
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:29,900
visionaries so it's one of the visionary

41
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:33,069
who regards it in the following way so

42
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:37,069
then so hey eye is very narrow now and

43
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:40,940
so then we operate in a very narrow

44
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:44,750
field but it gives us good results so

45
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:48,200
sometimes even even higher than than

46
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:52,670
expectations so then it's processing

47
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,890
text image recognition etc and they do

48
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:58,700
it much better than their human beings

49
00:02:54,890 --> 00:03:01,250
but this is all very narrow AI and and

50
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:05,720
so then the next step of development

51
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:08,239
there will be will be AI the AI of

52
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:11,480
general purpose the general purpose AI

53
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:15,140
so because cybersecurity kind of a

54
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:17,480
hacker inside the box yes and then

55
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:19,578
inside there is a there is a hacker and

56
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,840
then there is a small hole through which

57
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:26,000
you can feed the hacker with pizza and

58
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:29,780
this is the best approach so then we

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,680
need to widen the functionality of AI so

60
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:37,040
a I were to understand by AI is self

61
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:40,850
learning self learning and and

62
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,150
continuous expansion of capabilities and

63
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:46,700
then space as the sky's the limit

64
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:50,650
so functioning outside human

65
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:54,220
capabilities super brain etc

66
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:59,920
and that so this vision I don't like

67
00:03:54,220 --> 00:04:04,239
very much as well because it does not

68
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:06,339
does not coincide with my ideas as an

69
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,480
engineer so the way design should

70
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:12,819
develop and there's about everyone knows

71
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:16,089
Stanislav lem a wonderful writer and

72
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:19,389
some summer technology is a great book

73
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:23,859
that he wrote and allow me to quote so

74
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:28,539
then in in cybernetics so there is still

75
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:31,000
a middle world about homunculus and I

76
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:33,070
can't can't can't return can't character

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,960
and lead into gold and so but as the

78
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,820
nuclear physicist and he says yes

79
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,460
possible but it's not our business

80
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,560
but chemical cannot build the electronic

81
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:44,080
brain that will be better and better

82
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,510
than than a human brain no one will do

83
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:53,050
it although we can do it because no one

84
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:57,729
needs it and but and and this is why

85
00:04:53,050 --> 00:05:01,180
what we regard as as an AI so then a

86
00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:03,130
robot in the cloud managing the managing

87
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:09,160
the universe we just we don't need no

88
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:14,469
one on the other hand and so what can

89
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:18,280
possibly happen and now so we have very

90
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:24,190
very fashionable subjects like

91
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:30,549
self-driven cars so a big human looking

92
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:34,449
robots and etc and that's that's the

93
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:38,020
that's the limit right now discussed

94
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:41,349
very actively so lots of investments but

95
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:45,219
for me as an engineer because I I was in

96
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:47,199
the railroad engineer and all this so

97
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:50,520
driven cars is something that I don't

98
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:53,919
understand the value of yeah because we

99
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:58,639
so then automatic automatic driving in

100
00:05:53,919 --> 00:06:01,068
the railways exists since 1960 68

101
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,389
and the certain conditions are different

102
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,310
certainly there are very comfortable

103
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:07,039
conditions because you have the track

104
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:10,460
and the track is educated and they have

105
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:13,520
the good signaling so then so then other

106
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,948
sources of great train management is

107
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:20,139
there but still so it's been around for

108
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:24,590
many years so then then self driving in

109
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:27,469
automatic train operation so it's used

110
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:30,650
in the Metro and it's used in some

111
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:34,219
trains of restraints but generally they

112
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:36,529
don't do it why because someone someone

113
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:41,090
should just press the brakes someone

114
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:43,370
should take the responsibility to so

115
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:45,859
today to present a but but from the

116
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:48,610
engineering point of view so who about

117
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:53,779
who we're going to press the brakes so

118
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:57,349
was resolved 40 years ago and although

119
00:06:53,779 --> 00:07:00,830
many elements of automatic train brakes

120
00:06:57,349 --> 00:07:03,409
operation so they they've been around

121
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:06,318
for many years in the event something

122
00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:09,979
goes so the human factor it will just

123
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:12,219
break and so if there's a or or the

124
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:15,500
conductor will have to do that

125
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:18,529
pressing big red button and then cyber

126
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,990
cyber security issues are very high and

127
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:25,189
agenda so I've been involved in it and

128
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:29,000
and so that's exactly what my team was

129
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:32,389
doing so how to how to break train

130
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:38,659
systems so sometimes for the so with the

131
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:41,029
help of how to stop so how to how to

132
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:44,659
stop how to stop a train so that's all

133
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:47,419
you have to do it just is to drop so a

134
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:49,490
piece of metal rod it's just across the

135
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:54,068
rails and then the emotional circuited

136
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:54,069
and the train will derail

137
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:04,479
then turning so what we call AI

138
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,610
so then there was there was a review of

139
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:13,460
the company recently that was involved

140
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:18,370
in hey I and I came across many examples

141
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:20,630
when I was doing this study so when I

142
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:23,360
talked about understanding natural

143
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:26,180
languages so they follow very easy way

144
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,830
so we don't do these models who are not

145
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:34,070
interested so we take Y and X or we take

146
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:36,468
Microsoft api's so then then we throw

147
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:41,020
words into the cloud so the text comes

148
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:44,120
back and then on top of it we we

149
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:47,180
understand the natural language so then

150
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:50,180
I went into it so how this understanding

151
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:52,189
of natural language works because

152
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:54,560
eventual so there is and how to matter

153
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,480
that this needs to be responsible for

154
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,989
all this

155
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:01,610
there is no AI there no AI component

156
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:04,190
from the viewpoint of an every person

157
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:06,529
it's magic because you you compile

158
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:09,170
certain things and then then you say

159
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:11,600
something into into the mic and then it

160
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:12,140
goes into the cloud and then it does

161
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,209
something

162
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:18,830
logically comprehensive say anciently

163
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:20,089
doesn't and gives a good result so like

164
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:23,450
it looks like magic

165
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:26,959
so this voice voice were supporters and

166
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:28,850
automatic calling machines and in the

167
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,279
banking business so then they keep

168
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:36,560
calling then when they distinguish

169
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:38,209
emotions and so can imagine so they

170
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,579
don't have this thing at the back so it

171
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:44,029
keeps calling an old lady so you need to

172
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:46,320
return three thousand robots and the

173
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:51,570
poor lady is scared

174
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:54,660
and that's a different subject at the

175
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:56,579
end of the day so it's not magic so any

176
00:09:54,660 --> 00:10:00,180
school board can do that as a go to

177
00:09:56,579 --> 00:10:07,920
Hubbard and so take OpenCV compile and

178
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:09,959
then and then we usually do this work so

179
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:14,969
but many many pews many blocks are

180
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:18,719
available and this sense to do this

181
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:22,949
project cycle from A to Z no point all

182
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:26,519
we have to do is to take the the of the

183
00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:29,399
box solutions out of out of the box

184
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:35,750
solutions of the shell solutions and the

185
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:45,029
data sets are available these things are

186
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:48,660
existing everywhere and we expect to

187
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:51,360
find something there was a project the

188
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:55,939
analysis of the notes in the lungs and

189
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:59,579
there was this data center and 40,000

190
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:02,670
identified scan so MRI so they are and

191
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:04,560
on the internet and so that's a good

192
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:09,029
start so if you want just to see the

193
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:11,518
lungs and MRIs so then there are 40,000

194
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:13,920
told available on the Internet

195
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,990
but that's something that you need to

196
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:19,860
start so that you could go deeper and

197
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:22,970
and do this eternal eternal circle of

198
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,970
learning and

199
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:34,760
then so that's why you you go to the

200
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:38,570
higher abstract level you don't go into

201
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:41,600
detail and so you can always write a lot

202
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:44,630
of code but it's not always for the best

203
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:49,430
dancer sometimes if you need some kind

204
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:51,580
of Tesla to to teach your model and

205
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:54,859
there so you can always borrow it and

206
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:58,690
rent it and and play with it it's not

207
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:01,970
difficult and then so this is why Oh a

208
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:05,180
cloud cloud API so that we could share

209
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:08,060
we could share with us their data and so

210
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:10,099
all the companies so they they they

211
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,979
place so their information the cloud

212
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:16,370
because from same scent into into the

213
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:19,700
cloud because it's all identified it's

214
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:23,570
all available in the cloud and it's

215
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:27,260
shared and so then the difference

216
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:29,180
between the machine learning and AI the

217
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:31,100
difference is that it's written in

218
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,829
Python it's broke the machine learning

219
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:36,980
but if it's written and PowerPoint is

220
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:40,430
probably higher but effectively I

221
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:43,480
understood but this is an old slide and

222
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:47,150
so it doesn't work anymore it's for

223
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:50,180
soviet-type mathematicians because there

224
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:51,800
are some OpenCV in JavaScript and when

225
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:55,520
you're from the browser you can see

226
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:57,650
there is a triangle and so tell me what

227
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:00,560
kind of objects you have detected you

228
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:02,980
can do it all in front end now all in

229
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,518
front end that's our vision now

230
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:09,339
then the next step from the viewpoint of

231
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:14,470
the development on your technologies so

232
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:17,019
the basic one is is so then it's you to

233
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:20,679
monetize computing resources all big

234
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:24,699
vendors they invest a lot a lot in the

235
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:31,410
development of of processors optimized

236
00:13:24,699 --> 00:13:31,410
for for neural neural networks so then

237
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:41,139
we have the support video for their DG

238
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:44,889
Google in video Google TPU for way

239
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:50,709
ciarán they released the two to two

240
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:52,209
product lines released simultaneously at

241
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:53,888
the same time there is another thing so

242
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:58,079
there are servers of machine learning

243
00:13:53,889 --> 00:14:02,529
how he has them so with their own CPUs

244
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:06,910
so here for that area in Russia so we

245
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:10,869
are mostly for cameras and other just

246
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:13,779
embedded chips so so then we manufacture

247
00:14:10,869 --> 00:14:17,920
manufactures internet of things so that

248
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:19,540
it would do the initial processing and

249
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,209
then there is a classical store at the

250
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:25,839
top servers there's the cloud so it used

251
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:30,429
to be called mainframe then then goes to

252
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:33,730
the server and as general purpose as I

253
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:39,600
can then it goes to the desktop to

254
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:42,249
mobile to coyote and the client-server

255
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:46,029
calculations it took several decades to

256
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:46,990
do that from A to Z to cycle and go back

257
00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:50,829
to the cloud

258
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:54,519
I mean frame server computers

259
00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:58,239
yes I used to be distributed and and

260
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:59,739
then into the cloud so now just it it

261
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,379
has shortened to in the matter of

262
00:14:59,739 --> 00:15:06,490
several days 30 years it has become much

263
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:11,980
faster then I have

264
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:15,100
been watching this and I expect that all

265
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:19,240
these guys who were doing minors for

266
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:21,640
bitcoins so there will be certainly will

267
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:25,170
be going into the computer learning and

268
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:28,780
the cost of a cloud services will

269
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:31,510
considerably go down because it's Oris

270
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:37,140
it's obvious that it will must be much

271
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:41,250
cheaper especially if it will be in in

272
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:46,960
in consonance with the main framework

273
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:50,100
then I'd like to talk about practical

274
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:53,800
application cases product development

275
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:56,620
things and I have a question so when we

276
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:59,079
say red eyes what is it that comes to

277
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:09,180
your mind the first thing that comes to

278
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:14,740
my thought like that and then I met the

279
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:18,250
analysts of GRS and I met them so those

280
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:23,680
that look at g-packs with with the

281
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:25,570
resolution of 150 thousand pixels and

282
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,699
trying just to find something does their

283
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:33,090
work so they've been it all the time

284
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:33,090
so this these guys they love their work

285
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:55,680
share positive doesn't computer vision

286
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:55,680
works pretty well we need to teach

287
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:15,599
cheap satellites in they cover a lot of

288
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:17,429
a lot of firsts and then actually five

289
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:27,389
meters per pixel that's the resolution

290
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:29,549
you can even order point three meters so

291
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:34,320
we launch satellites and we have all

292
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:42,510
these pictures but what do we do next

293
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:44,730
task to make sure that you relate so

294
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:48,658
they go to the interface and say so find

295
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:52,530
all the cars in this region so find me

296
00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:54,840
the place where they grow wheat forest

297
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:58,760
acacia love crops is a very serious task

298
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,760
and so please find that this do this

299
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:16,949
analytics such a huge market for this

300
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:34,500
high-resolution pictures and their so

301
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:37,190
they're working in this area sitting in

302
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,190
that parking lot

303
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:53,720
so they dynamic so the wholesale my

304
00:18:45,870 --> 00:19:02,270
competitor do something to change my

305
00:18:53,720 --> 00:19:02,270
approach this is burgeoning

306
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:12,699
so there's Coco didn't study it's a very

307
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:12,699
good information which companies do what

308
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:37,450
banking culture security security oil

309
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:42,080
and gas satellite pictures and then the

310
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:56,200
useful information that needed by

311
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:56,199
different industries and then based so

312
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,990
so for example oil spills

313
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:23,860
big fines for the company producer and

314
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:23,860
if you so then it's done quite easily

315
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:44,960
in in the region you need to watch the

316
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:51,539
training colleagues from a South Korean

317
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:59,549
small holding cell farmers dancers they

318
00:20:51,539 --> 00:21:03,270
contribute no they all the crops which

319
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:08,250
which crop and furniture which crop will

320
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:10,529
eventually end up in our storage they

321
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:13,080
don't know this data in the United

322
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:22,130
States the data that they collect are

323
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:22,129
using drones how much of each cross

324
00:21:35,539 --> 00:22:03,020
monitoring oil oil storage especially if

325
00:21:45,020 --> 00:22:14,149
catches open figures that they calling

326
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:14,149
activity-based geo-economics this term

327
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,360
terms

328
00:23:49,460 --> 00:24:00,110
we need to build a new friend experience

329
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:12,530
the mining and the big data processing

330
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,530
same challenges

331

333
00:25:55,149 --> 00:26:05,109
warrants ocean is one thing and

334
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:08,600
they're processed stored so that and

335
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:12,320
then the preliminary processing is very

336
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:18,409
important because they provide different

337
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:26,570
angles so different culture colors color

338
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:32,830
correction photo mosaics and then they

339
00:27:26,570 --> 00:28:00,950
come the model steady process people

340
00:27:32,830 --> 00:28:03,020
correlation so recently morality of

341
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:05,300
homelessness

342
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:10,160
so again the article about different

343
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:16,659
options of Wharf it's very interesting

344
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:21,250
case that is in in a moment for

345
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:27,170
identifying it get skin cancer it was

346
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:31,429
funny overfitting many photos contained

347
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:34,490
in line because people would use it to

348
00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:37,880
total or see the size of the

349
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:40,929
malformation and the model actually was

350
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:43,640
learning and I decided that if it is a

351
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:46,880
ruler than members of other people

352
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:51,280
measure then it's positive not false

353
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:55,040
positive so that's why I am saying it

354
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:58,450
because numbers are false positive and

355
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:03,980
false negatives are artificial in

356
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:06,170
practical life available there is an

357
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:08,750
interesting direction developing in the

358
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:10,270
computer security that identifying

359
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:17,600
so-called

360
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:20,210
adversary' examples some people you know

361
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,340
wear a special t-shirt and the computer

362
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:27,559
recognition system doesn't see himself

363
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:30,860
I'm skeptical so we can arrange that

364
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:32,990
this system will identify you still no

365
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:35,090
matter what t-shirt you wear but

366
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:38,179
certainly the future belongs to those

367
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:41,419
machine system and certainly so far you

368
00:29:38,179 --> 00:29:46,700
cannot trust them if we're detected

369
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:50,390
that's good if it doesn't detect most of

370
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:53,750
us security guys here we trust our

371
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:56,000
antivirus and firewalls in the same

372
00:29:53,750 --> 00:30:00,130
manner if it works it's good if it

373
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,130
doesn't work you go and fix it manually

374
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:11,370
the improving the models trying to

375
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:14,610
install some backdoors and the model is

376
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:17,250
very popular as models evolve even

377
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:19,800
faster all in those cases you know you

378
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:23,150
publish and you fix about very soon it's

379
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:26,280
going to be a very interesting concept

380
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:28,850
we keep in with that we face all the

381
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:31,950
time in our organization there is a team

382
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:39,120
science these are fundamental scientists

383
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:41,160
who I am supposed to make a product

384
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,620
forbidden effort that will be

385
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:46,350
interesting for specific customers how

386
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:54,870
do I compile this PDF how shall I put it

387
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:57,300
into a doctor because for instance you

388
00:30:54,870 --> 00:31:00,659
have a prototyping team and then it will

389
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:03,620
do something for it then it's easy to

390
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:07,200
convert all the growth is simple but

391
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:09,360
what those guys are doing PDF sometimes

392
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,460
takes half a year to compile into a

393
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,860
working model because they do something

394
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:16,500
specific they say oh yes we have

395
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:18,929
improved here by half percent we know to

396
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:23,160
conference you look at the real data in

397
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:24,810
about in fact it's not even a race but

398
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,060
decline because they made it for

399
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:30,629
specific story and the quality of the

400
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:37,399
code requires verification of the model

401
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:40,320
that they teach of machine time you

402
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:42,420
really educate the model then they use

403
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:52,050
on test data compared with perfection

404
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:54,210
look at the gap fix it standard and

405
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:57,060
become more difficult with big volumes

406
00:31:54,210 --> 00:32:05,270
if you do data centers and then you have

407
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:05,270
another headache use the GPU resources

408
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:24,399
you see in the picture some nice guy

409
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:26,260
just failed it lives there and after

410
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:33,820
that the person comes to you said my

411

memory is over my dgx d2 is over youwant

412
00:32:33,820 --> 00:33:01,870
OC was wrong but it's just using only

413
00:32:36,010 --> 00:33:07,650
one card of another video you must of

414
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:07,649
the sharpness of an image you see that

415
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:29,800
did some magic allows from the plate

416
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:39,280
number when I called my colleagues no

417
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:43,590
guesses super resolution just some

418
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:49,750
physics because it's the air that's

419
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:52,510
torching the image you have different

420
00:33:49,750 --> 00:34:05,260
information you have to do this to check

421
00:33:52,510 --> 00:34:08,350
you know equation use it because when

422
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:13,630
they just highlight the dots near the

423
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:16,639
star then show that there is no magic no

424
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:22,290
no magic at all

425
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:33,840
Russian Martian probes in the

426

information so many times people believe

427
00:34:33,840 --> 00:36:17,030
people don't understand in my opinion

428
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:17,030
from IBM I apologize

429
00:36:29,210 --> 00:37:56,040
it's conventional security that answered

430
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:58,500
it's the data integrity as data come

431
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:00,540
from different sources and they're so

432
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:09,960
different than first and you have

433
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:16,910
different processing it's very antivirus

434
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:20,010
process one which is satellite image no

435
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:22,529
because they just look at the headers

436
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:26,010
and say come on that's big

437
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:28,550
I want but if you load it into the

inside integrity if you take that image

about implementation of digital

447
00:39:55,909 --> 00:40:05,309
fingerprints I have tried I don't know

448
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:13,439
but I'm concerned that it will impact

449
00:40:05,309 --> 00:40:15,689
the source data the model may not see it

450
00:40:13,439 --> 00:40:18,989
may try to recognize digital

451
00:40:15,689 --> 00:40:22,919
fingerprints instead of cracking 3:46

00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:39,300
confident data confidentiality is

455
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:44,380
important dentistry first IP protection

456
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:53,970
orders of life box and we work with many

457
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:57,360
partners and I can large grub streams I

458
00:40:53,970 --> 00:41:03,220
never used more than 15 minutes that

459
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:10,120
tool to understand how it works so try

460
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:12,339
to make some security around it I have a

461
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:19,270
feeling that now we are back in the

462
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:21,580
nineties and the security in serial key

463
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:23,950
and I will activate them but the model

464
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:27,940
especially for the enterprise solution

465
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:31,060
is an expensive toy so in order to bring

466
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:37,480
it well in order to use it that you need

467
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:39,520
money someone tries to live use this

468
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:42,040
intellectual property it doesn't really

469
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:45,400
need to understand how it works because

470
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:48,940
if you just the input of here and there

471
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:52,060
you have the results and before it may

472
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:54,850
take two years to deviate from reality

473
00:41:52,060 --> 00:42:02,049
and you can still use it on the second

474
00:41:54,850 --> 00:42:12,790
problem that we do you train your models

475
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:14,830
so it's good but not in your in my

476
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:17,140
specific network here so you're here the

477
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:19,720
system and the system gives keeps giving

478
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:22,540
him false alarms you want to remove

479
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:28,060
those false positives ideally you need

480
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:30,009
to take his data and take it using to

481
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:32,730
your model he said no I'm not I'm not

482
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:36,250
giving you the data according to the law

483
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:38,320
152 so it's clear

484
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:42,550
you can do it for large plans you can go

485
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:45,550
to his place and educate and use the

486
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:47,730
model but if it is you know many small

487
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:52,530
clients you need to find other options

488
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:52,530
you cannot do it for each and everything

489
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:57,030
so there is another problem

490
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:05,520
which for me is to what extent the

491
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:09,849
source data mainly

492
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:12,820
from the model there are several studies

493
00:43:09,849 --> 00:43:23,650
in this respect in this area I believe

494
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:24,160
most of you are familiar confidential

495
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:26,230
data

496
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:35,410
you still keep a bit more like in

folders username try on spam day that's

498
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:41,830
here what still there somehow all date

499
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:44,290
in the model clearly that this amount is

500
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:48,509
less on the graphic data I don't have

501
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:52,589
much time I wanted to show you this one

502
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:53,900
you must have seen but synchronicity

503
00:43:52,589 --> 00:43:56,989
nationalizations

505
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:08,619
these are guys they try to do rivers

506
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:11,140
reverse engineering on computer vision

507
00:44:08,619 --> 00:44:13,990
they try to understand which layer does

508
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:18,819
what so they show you kitchen lamp and

509
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:21,669
looper this neuron is activated is this

510
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:24,369
one is responsible for the face and then

511
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:27,650
it turns out that there are levels which

512
00:44:24,369 --> 00:44:33,930
are responsible for text recognition

513
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:40,290
the model was using faces but if there

514
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:43,879
is text then this one this neuron will

515
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:48,870
be activated though it should recognize

516
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:53,820
other things and this is residual

517
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:59,040
information look I was showing you the

518
00:44:53,820 --> 00:45:02,850
printed text and activated the upper the

519
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:06,590
model for faces position it's not

520
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:09,240
transparent it's murky and just like

521
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:12,560
paranoid security guy

522
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:16,229
we have questioned your cells can't be

523
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:18,799
hiding inside certainly the volume is

524
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:24,300
restricting here you cannot squeeze in a

525
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:30,410
gigabyte file into this model and there

526
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:33,480
is another fresh study made me happy

527
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:50,000
depending if what side you're on

528
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:53,220
offensive or defensive this cut because

529
00:45:50,000 --> 00:46:00,060
neuro grades into smaller glasses the

530
00:45:53,220 --> 00:46:02,069
function so if you had a huge grid with

531
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:05,310
hundreds of layers that you take only

532
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:09,960
ten and you use it for your goal that's

533
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:15,540
done for optimization it's a good tool

534
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:19,410
for IP violations or protector so if you

535
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:21,840
have any ideas or developments I would

536
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:24,200
be happy to talk to you because this is

537
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,200
my

538
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:32,009
20 of interest and their cybersecurity

539
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:35,070
as usual considering the complexity and

540
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:37,589
the volumes it would add new keywords

541
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:38,640
for instance at the network level they

542
00:46:37,589 --> 00:46:41,790
can finish band

543
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:43,740
where's which which has less security

544
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:53,070
than other than all software-defined

545
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:57,899
network that is difficult to protect GPU

546
00:46:53,070 --> 00:47:01,560
security is an issue because it's a

547
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:03,839
video card why protect but if you look

548
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:06,710
at the risk of vulnerabilities in an

549
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:10,049
video it's huge

550
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:14,550
if GPU in this cloud and you provide

551
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:18,480
access to this GPU there was a wonderful

552
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:22,440
example how to do all hammer attack the

553
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:25,530
GPU on Android so it works it is great

554
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:30,930
so you can just treat the memory not

555
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:33,890
only yours but someone else's unpleasant

556
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:37,319
things and a big problem

Dockers security there is no security

558
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:41,030
and per se because a doper

559
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:49,200
if you allow TCP socket you give him

560
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:51,029
access so you need permission and round

561
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,460
their abilities in machine learning with

562
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:57,089
frameworks I just told you that it's

563
00:47:53,460 --> 00:48:00,140
good but no one really took care of

564
00:47:57,089 --> 00:48:07,580
their security expansion libraries and

565
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:07,580
many vulnerabilities good for mobility

00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:18,530
in Harbor space cyber security force in

567
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:18,530
big data and artificial intellect

568
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:26,400
at least to be able then I'll be able to

569
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:26,940
answer at least couple question I hope

570
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:33,960
so

571
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:36,570
in conclusion so this is a cycle of

572
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:41,369
artificial intelligence in fact or some

573
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:44,040
extent know the situation in machine

574
00:48:41,369 --> 00:48:47,780
learning reminds a blockchain and

575
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:53,869
everything around it if you remember

576
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:57,210
John McCarthy just before Bitcoin

577
00:48:53,869 --> 00:48:59,190
you know it's expected it to cost a

578
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:08,640
million because he invested heavily he

579
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:10,500
wants it to be to to himself has a

580
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:16,650
similar message because they said you

581
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:19,170
know artificial intellect eraser should

582
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:22,109
go to China invented into Chinese

583
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:27,720
company invested into Chinese custom on

584
00:49:22,109 --> 00:49:31,259
the other hand that we can see the

585
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:36,689
certain situation for instance of face

586
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:40,140
recognition technology here on here they

587
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:44,490
only changes less than 1% in the quality

588
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:49,279
and good in addition the Russian company

589
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:53,069
is in the first time in this race

590
00:49:49,280 --> 00:50:07,500
sustainably the first but we cannot

591
00:49:53,069 --> 00:50:12,060
expect another quality yet that are

592
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:17,780
still under estimated coming back to

593
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:20,970

you know headset VFX one I was some

598
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:49,089
maybe 15 or 14 years old and I could

599
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:49,720
play it was so inconvenient but in five

600
00:50:49,089 --> 00:50:52,420
minutes

601
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:54,549
my eyes were watering but I realized

602
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:57,670
that is the future that belongs very

603
00:50:54,550 --> 00:51:08,109
soon instead of black and white TV it

604
00:50:57,670 --> 00:51:18,190
will it will penetrate every house the

human machine interface our emotion

606
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:36,059
solution this lines I mean you should

607
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:49,859
those devices that didn't find much

608
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:04,180
interfaces that should really change our

609
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:11,290
interaction with virtual world is where

610
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:13,299
the artificial so there are some

611
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:16,509
developments let me mention I've rented

612
00:52:13,299 --> 00:52:19,140
a Russian company work in that

615
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:35,460
this virtual reality's not a matrix that

616
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:38,009
you know appears but we still perceive

617
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:44,730
the world through information and the

618
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:47,340
information once generated properly can

00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:49,560
influence our behavior and the

620
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:54,230
perception of the world so let me give

621
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:58,799
you a simple example all banks now want

622
00:53:54,230 --> 00:54:02,250
when when you come to their there would

623
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:05,190
be a radius thing that you can buy so a

special occasion with special needs

625
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:14,060
depending on your music preferences the

the current needs

we have a special administrative control

if you compare it's the same we will be

the future the future be in the black

00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:51,330
I respect the humanity because it went

to the outer space it built him the

634
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:56,369
human can build an artificial culture

635
00:55:53,839 --> 00:56:04,859
comparable or probably exceeding the

636
00:55:56,369 --> 00:56:07,920
natural know I respect human rights

637
00:56:04,859 --> 00:56:15,270
survived and is going to survive in the

638
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:18,650
future am I afraid any certain time I

639
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:23,060
can just turn off the electricity in all

you spin the bottle gross we have still

00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:37,589
time I would like to remind you to first

643
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:39,870
round question as two guys who asked the

644
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:43,940
question first of all get the t-shirts

645
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:43,940
Rises first thank you

646
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:56,460
the chief of artificial sight this

647
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:59,010
Marcus city and things like that maybe

648
00:56:56,460 --> 00:57:07,980
you have some cases and stories and

649
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:13,080
opinions like an infinite process you

650
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:15,750
can deceive everything and if the

651
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:18,150
question is how many times if you can't

652
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:21,210
cheat a specific camera of specific

653
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:23,100
preferred producer in specific ways it

654
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:25,050
does not mean that you will be able to

655
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:35,100
cheat code cameras because there are

656
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:38,520
ways to track you a port cesium then

657
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:42,480
they for example the access control on

658
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:45,930
the basis of biometrics it's not cast

659
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:48,540
because access access control is based

660
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:50,850
on a secret because your face is not the

661
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:54,120
same it's public domain you will talk

662
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:56,850
about the way how to how to monitor you

663
00:57:54,120 --> 00:58:01,529
how to identify you how to recognize

664
00:57:56,850 --> 00:58:03,029
your face so then so there are some so

665
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:05,610
there are different different options so

666
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:07,500
they they hold it like this so if you

667
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:10,110
turn your hand like this they don't they

668
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:12,530
disappeared for example second cheat so

669
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:15,050
it will be my son cat game all the time

670
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:18,230
though we should have a kebab across

671
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:18,230
Napa toast

672
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:29,810
what guerrilla para Mirai

673
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:31,220
we talked about morality okay hi so

674
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:34,580
they're the most frequent question

675
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:35,689
here's a situation whereby than a

676
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:39,560
self-driving car

677
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:42,220
so there is a wall and the on the right

678
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:47,840
is the lady with the baby on the left

679
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:52,339
and and so who the who the a I will hit

680
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:54,560
run down it's not it's not the correct

681
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:59,150
so what which which answer will be

682
00:58:54,560 --> 00:59:02,900
programmed into into into record because

683
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:04,640
the the human the programming the

684
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:07,670
programming engineer is getting us to

685
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:10,339
program program the color so now just to

686
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:14,360
go into the wall what to go into what

687
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:17,140
they run down the lady of the child so

688
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:21,920
what they do what the regulatory

689
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:24,290
authorities will will set standards so

690
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:27,590
then they will get together they will

691
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:29,870
decide that good like this because

692
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:34,120
certainly then the machine has no

693
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:34,120
morality that's true

694
00:59:40,069 --> 00:59:46,799
thank you for the presentation so in

695
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:51,720
your everyday like how do you protect

696
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:57,059
your model so either the cloud or or

697
00:59:51,720 --> 01:00:01,140
just papers so we will encrypt certain

698
00:59:57,059 --> 01:00:04,109
things away but it's only at its at an

699
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:08,160
initial initial level of trust because

700
01:00:04,109 --> 01:00:11,779
we have Enterprise Products for the mass

701
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:14,879
market it's not been resolved this issue

702
01:00:11,779 --> 01:00:16,829
because at enterprise big clients you

703
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:19,170
can always talk to them agree with them

704
01:00:16,829 --> 01:00:26,339
but if you start mass producing then

705
01:00:19,170 --> 01:00:30,809
this issue will the machines provide

706
01:00:26,339 --> 01:00:33,630
good results and you were talking about

707
01:00:30,809 --> 01:00:36,420
some some places where there will be no

708
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:39,359
results because the experts analytics

709
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:42,569
will be required anyway and the machine

710
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:46,230
will not do anything for example we take

711
01:00:42,569 --> 01:00:50,819
the existing stack security products

712
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:53,490
until our fraud and the soccer and call

713
01:00:50,819 --> 01:00:57,630
center operators efforts so are there

714
01:00:53,490 --> 01:01:00,660
any any instances when they say what you

715
01:00:57,630 --> 01:01:04,319
can automate and what tests we can do it

716
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:07,170
would help a I and and what so the

717
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:10,920
expert opinion will be required anyway

718
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:14,190
so the human interference will be needed

719
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:17,069
anyway so in the last year and a half I

720
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:22,230
haven't been watching this but in my

721
01:01:17,069 --> 01:01:25,740
experience so it works well where there

722
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:28,769
is a there's a there's a there's a big

723
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:31,529
data volume but they cannot properly

724
01:01:28,769 --> 01:01:33,508
properly process it so for example that

725
01:01:31,529 --> 01:01:37,950
it execution from 1 million and

726
01:01:33,509 --> 01:01:40,440
endpoints so you cannot graph or index

727
01:01:37,950 --> 01:01:41,750
for whatever you cannot you cannot do it

728
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:50,270
well anyway

729
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:53,030
and then there is a huge database and so

730
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:55,910
that you can automate and then on the

731
01:01:53,030 --> 01:02:01,780
basis of its automation you can already

732
01:01:55,910 --> 01:02:03,170
do it manually I like white lists

733
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:06,260
security

734
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:10,060
I like those worthless but how to build

735
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:14,810
those white lists for example for graphs

736
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:20,390
so the majority worse so that's a

737
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:33,770
baseline for for for the follow-up

738
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:36,000
effort okay thank you thank you thank

739
01:02:33,770 --> 01:02:39,050
you very much boys

740
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,050
[Applause]
