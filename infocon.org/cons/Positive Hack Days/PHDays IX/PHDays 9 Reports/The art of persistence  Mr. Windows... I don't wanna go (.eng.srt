1
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:36,000
sorry a little bit more and also

2
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:40,969
developer assembly for microcontrollers

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:46,140
and microprocessors and C++ Python golem

4
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:48,750
as Speaker I get that F connect apart in

5
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:52,260
Argentina hiking box another security

6
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:55,230
conference it's my first time here in pH

7
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:59,608
stays in the first time in Moscow as

8
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:04,140
well so thanks for the opportunity well

9
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:07,619
this song is about persistence when an

10
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,729
attackers compromised a system he or she

11
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:15,270
looks for at least two different things

12
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:20,700
first it the highest privilege the

13
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:24,110
system and second try to persist as long

14
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:30,200
as possible inside the system that means

15
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:34,650
survive to reward detections and so on

16
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:37,340
sounds like a long time ago the most

17
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:42,930
common way to persist on Windows system

18
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:45,600
using Frankie's sir but inside the

19
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,899
window fresh history where we can't find

20
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:52,199
those programs starting together with

21
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:56,549
Windows the most common one is the one

22
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:59,360
that we can see in the screen and hecu

23
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:03,740
the main hkey current user software

24
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:08,369
microsoft windows currentversion run as

25
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:11,160
example you have two very ultrasounds

26
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:14,099
I'm sure that if there are hackers from

27
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,730
the old school here they can recognize

28
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:18,859
them

29
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:23,429
these are poison ivy on spine it and

30
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:27,230
what use rank is to make persistence but

31
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:34,230
use the same key in the Windows registry

32
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:37,290
and today we still use Frankie's to make

33
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:39,988
persistence for example in Metasploit

34
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:43,859
one of the most popular security tools

35
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:46,799
if we run the persistence comment on a

36
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:49,230
matter preserve session we see that this

37
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:53,370
model will create an entry in the

38
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:57,390
windows path of the rank keys so we are

39
00:02:53,370 --> 00:03:00,060
using the same technique to versus there

40
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:04,559
are a few variants some of my work

41
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:08,099
writes there use others Franky's to

42
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:11,090
persist for example these ones under

43
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:14,578
current version policies program or

44
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:17,970
current version special folders there

45
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:19,859
are other to reign keys that we can use

46
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,530
in the window registry there are other

47
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:28,170
programs starting together with Windows

48
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:31,799
sir in fact is we use autoruns

49
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:34,559
a tool from CSIS tunnel suite we can see

50
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:36,810
the list with all the programs starting

51
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,190
together with Windows with their

52
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:44,489
respective Brian key so use disperse

53
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:50,400
this technique to persist path of least

54
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:52,680
two counts first adding an entry in our

55
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,519
right key is suspicious for the

56
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:59,639
antivirals and second is very easy to

57
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:02,549
find the my work and user can check the

58
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:06,060
registry or use a tool like this one and

59
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:08,459
find my work and delete or disable the T

60
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:12,750
entry in the registry and kill the

61
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:18,329
persistent so the great question is this

62
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:20,510
is the best way well now we will see

63
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:24,140
three different techniques to

64
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:26,750
ceasing Windows system and really they

65
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:30,530
are not new techniques they are not

66
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:32,570
found by this by me but there is not

67
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:36,229
much documentation on how we can

68
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:41,360
implement them so I will show you how we

69
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:43,940
can use them in practice before starting

70
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,120
I would like to explain some basic

71
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:53,110
concepts the store like you review about

72
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:56,470
come office they are a C++ class with

73
00:04:53,110 --> 00:05:01,060
instructor define by Microsoft and

74
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:05,300
usually they I compile as DLL files and

75
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:09,650
they can be loaded by our program outers

76
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:12,650
process or in process in the case of in

77
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:16,099
process we have the account object the

78
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:18,770
DLL loaded inside the program inside the

79
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:24,070
the client process which is the program

80
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:24,070
that means the functions of the object

81
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:30,050
if we want to know what kind of we

82
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:32,420
have in our computer we can use this

83
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:35,780
tool this is the kind of ship viewer

84
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:37,970
it's a total native in Windows and there

85
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:42,859
we can see the list with all the count

86
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:46,250
objects available in our system if we do

87
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:50,600
a little bit of soon we can see that for

88
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:54,580
each count option we have a CLS ID which

89
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:59,120
is sum and 16 bytes all right known as

90
00:05:54,580 --> 00:06:03,169
widely and this identified the object as

91
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,890
unique in the world and it's always

92
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:08,930
straight and it's always the same and

93
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:11,270
for example in in my Windows

94
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:15,110
installation I have thought oh with

95
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:17,390
that why D and in yours installation is

96
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:20,420
the same even it's the same between

97
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:22,940
different version of windows in Windows

98
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:25,340
7 we have this object with this variety

99
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:28,550
and in Windows 10 we have the same

100
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:31,549
option with the same gliding is we want

101
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:34,080
to generate our own option we can use

102
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:38,189
this tool the disability

103
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:41,280
sigh peacefully to you or an easy way is

104
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:44,280
to use a online generator there are a

105
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,780
lot of websites where we can generate

106
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,679
our own wighting

107
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:54,750
this very very easy to create our own

108
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:57,990
identifier every common option is inside

109
00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:02,310
the Windows registry we can't find them

110
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:06,930
below the e key local machine or to a

111
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:09,509
user under the pad software classes clsi

112
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:13,379
beans and the go ID of the count option

113
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:17,520
and in silas inside the key of the color

114
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:20,280
option we have different soft key that I

115
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,789
used to give some information to the

116
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:27,299
client process to load them but we are

117
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:30,229
interesting on this specific sub skills

118
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,879
in truck server salsa to improve server

119
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:37,139
impact had resulted to our impact

120
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:41,430
angular because days of key specified

121
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:43,949
the path to the DLL so they pass to the

122
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:46,229
code of the calm option the client

123
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:51,300
processes the program will load this

124
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:53,610
specific DLL okay we are ready so let's

125
00:07:51,300 --> 00:08:01,979
start with the first technique this is

126
00:07:53,610 --> 00:08:05,159
persistence we shall accept let's start

127
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:11,849
with the first magnet overseas in shell

128
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:17,449
extensions those Microsoft if developers

129
00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:21,029
the possibility to integrate some

130
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:24,990
applications the Windows user interface

131
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:28,770
the Explorer we can use differential

132
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:31,560
extensions probably the most common is

133
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:34,198
this one the context menu shalt

134
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:38,219
extension there are a lot of application

135
00:08:34,198 --> 00:08:42,120
on using it for example notepad plus

136
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:44,850
plus let's the user open a text file or

137
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,579
any file with a right click in the

138
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:49,769
nose so if this is a context menu shell

139
00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:54,359
extension or WinRAR or other

140
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:57,420
applications shell extension already

141
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:00,930
signed a Windows registry as well but

142
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:03,899
those which are system-wide they are

143
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:06,300
inside the local machine key software

144
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:09,810
classes will car shellacs

145
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:12,540
assign it the context menu hundred kids

146
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:15,508
and inside it we have all the programs

147
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:20,399
using shell extensions for example there

148
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:23,430
we have the winner are on the other hand

149
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:27,420
we have shell extension for the current

150
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:30,689
user and we have to know that sustain

151
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:33,120
those extension for the current user can

152
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:36,959
be registered without asking for

153
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:42,060
permissions so we can create create our

154
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:44,729
ocean extension with a admin rights and

155
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:47,489
we will do it we will create our own

156
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:50,790
shell extension that of course it will

157
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:53,639
be a malicious one and if we do the

158
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:57,630
process manually we should start

159
00:09:53,639 --> 00:10:01,589
creating the key for the shell extension

160
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:04,980
and due to shell extension our count of

161
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:08,370
shots we have to identify them using a

162
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:11,490
quiet in a random Kuwaiti so we will

163
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:14,579
generate one and after that we will

164
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:19,170
create the corresponding key for that

165
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:21,899
specific avoid in below the password all

166
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:24,389
come options are located yes

167
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:25,259
below the current user software classes

168
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:27,600
clsid

169
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:30,990
and the corresponding quality that we

170
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:34,410
will we have to generate it and then

171
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:38,759
below the quality we have to create the

172
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:41,189
improv server key where we are able to

173
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:45,509
specify the path to a dll this is the

174
00:10:41,189 --> 00:10:49,980
dll our malicious DLL the DLL of our

175
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:54,110
shell extension we can use Metasploit to

176
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:56,240
create a malicious DLL we are creating a

177
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:58,970
reporter DLL

178
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,300
so we can use these endless effort panel

179
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:07,550
to generate them which is paler in DLL

180
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:09,859
format and then to infect the computer

181
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:13,969
we can use up our transcript

182
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:18,319
you have a little PowerShell script it

183
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:22,329
has three main parts in the first part

184
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:25,969
we are creating the necessary keys to

185
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:30,309
register our shell extension using our

186
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:34,009
random boy ID and then we have the

187
00:11:30,309 --> 00:11:35,089
create then we are creating the keys for

188
00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:37,189
the comb option

189
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:39,679
remember that share extension are come

190
00:11:37,189 --> 00:11:42,139
options so we have to create a key for

191
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:45,759
the shell extension itself and the key

192
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:50,269
for the object using always the same yd

193
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:53,689
and finally we have a marathon ladder so

194
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:57,679
we are downloaded the met reporter DLL

195
00:11:53,689 --> 00:12:01,969
and let me say that this clip is not

196
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:03,649
detected by virus looks like it is doing

197
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:06,889
nothing suspicious

198
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:10,339
we are totally done member but we are

199
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:16,519
not executing it so it is not detected

200
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:20,600
by antivirus let's see what happened you

201
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:24,110
have our malicious power shot it is

202
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,639
creating the necessary keys and on the

203
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:29,029
other hand we have an attacker machine

204
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:31,549
waiting for the better registration and

205
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:35,600
when the user tries to do a right-click

206
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:38,110
on any file the attacker receives the

207
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:42,319
connection why this happen

208
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:45,439
well Windows is loading our malicious

209
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:48,259
shell extension and the DLL of our shell

210
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:51,049
extension is the meterpreter shell so

211
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:54,170
it's winner Explorer which is flooding

212
00:12:51,049 --> 00:12:58,249
our meterpreter and executing it so the

213
00:12:54,170 --> 00:13:00,769
attacker receives the connection okay to

214
00:12:58,249 --> 00:13:02,809
set up this first technique we can use

215
00:13:00,769 --> 00:13:06,799
shell extensions to make malware

216
00:13:02,809 --> 00:13:09,390
persistence and the record doesn't need

217
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:14,400
any admin right

218
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:17,040
and we can register any shell extension

219
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:19,880
without permissions high permissions

220
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:23,790
even it works in a standard account and

221
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:28,290
it's just it's stealthy method at least

222
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:30,810
more stealthier than use rang keys okay

223
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:34,740
let's go to the sorry our accumulation

224
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:38,099
use PowerShell because PowerShell is a

225
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:43,550
trust finally for for Windows so we can

226
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:47,130
modify the registry with that extensions

227
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:49,500
power series up by level in any user in

228
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:53,220
Windows so by default so we don't have

229
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:57,540
problems ok let's go to the second tenet

230
00:13:53,220 --> 00:14:02,490
this is persistent using Kawasaki what

231
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:06,180
is called hijack well most application

232
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:08,850
loads come off checks usually they come

233
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:11,939
option that the application are looking

234
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:17,250
for it's located at the local machine

235
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:20,550
pad software classes clsid the problem

236
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:25,820
is that usually applications to our

237
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:29,969
first search below the current user pads

238
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:32,180
it's the quality doesn't axis we have

239
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:36,870
the possibility to do work on her Shack

240
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:39,479
because we can create the key that the

241
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:42,690
application is looking for or is trying

242
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,770
to find and we can write a path to a

243
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:48,110
malicious DLL

244
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:53,250
and we can do it without admin rights

245
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:55,170
and maybe you can't believe it but most

246
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:58,830
application that we use everyday are

247
00:14:55,170 --> 00:15:03,959
vulnerable to call hijack we can hunt

248
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:06,390
them and use process monitor and this is

249
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:09,570
a tool for us with ASUS internal suite

250
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:15,060
and make sure that using these filters

251
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:18,870
here we are filtering my result with not

252
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,760
named not found in path which contains

253
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:22,970
the

254
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,519
subkey that we are interesting on the

255
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:29,930
rocks are wearing improv collar kiss

256
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:33,110
were to specify the path to the dll so

257
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:36,500
here we have an example is weeks cute

258
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:40,329
crumb we can see that the browser is

259
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:44,149
looking for a lot of count of

260
00:15:40,329 --> 00:15:47,239
without positive results the scroll was

261
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:51,110
too long so we have a lot of come up

262
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:54,709
 vulnerable to call high shock we

263
00:15:51,110 --> 00:16:01,399
just have to choose one and use it to

264
00:15:54,709 --> 00:16:05,569
make persistence again we can use a

265
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:08,510
PowerShell script we are just creating

266
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:11,120
the key for the count of shots we are

267
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:13,959
using the quality of the calm object

268
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,610
come option one rebel to come hijack and

269
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:22,810
after work we out on lady they met

270
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:22,810
repeated DLL so let's see what happened

271
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:31,310
again we run the PowerShell to create

272
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:33,410
the kiss and we have the attacker

273
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:34,209
machine waiting for the metal photo

274
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,730
session

275
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:40,849
when the user clicks on google chrome

276
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:42,709
the attacker receives the connection so

277
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:46,699
this white currently study in our

278
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:50,839
malicious DLL do it to the kohai shock

279
00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:52,670
and let me decide that a lot of cohosh

280
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:55,250
acts are in common with other

281
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:58,279
applications for example this one that

282
00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:01,910
we use for Google Chrome is in common

283
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:04,849
it works on Firefox you so you don't

284
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:08,569
have to know what web browser will call

285
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:13,549
the installed in the target machine but

286
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:15,740
we still depend on application so I

287
00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:19,760
thought that it would be nice since we

288
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:25,730
can do a con hijack to an ad become

289
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:28,940
option and I've set of windows and if we

290
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:31,010
go to the classes root key we can see

291
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:34,790
all the chrome options now

292
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:36,830
system and we can check the data you

293
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:40,129
have an idea if the account options

294
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:45,050
might be an eight account option from

295
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:47,290
windows or Microsoft or not but we could

296
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:50,600
do a cohosh out here but we cannot

297
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:54,110
modify anything in the class route a

298
00:17:50,600 --> 00:18:02,570
king without permissions without arming

299
00:17:54,110 --> 00:18:06,020
admin rights so I thought I discovered

300
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:08,840
that that's a route is a mix between the

301
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:11,570
local machine key in the software cassis

302
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:16,340
pad and the curing user kid in the

303
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:20,169
software cassis is a mix of those keys

304
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:22,970
so we cannot modify a dealer claim

305
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:26,840
that's a fruit king in a local machine

306
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:30,830
without admin rights but we can write

307
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:34,250
the current user key without rights so

308
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:39,980
we can do a kind of poisoning to the

309
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:42,950
classic fruit team we are using again a

310
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:46,040
powers we clipped the same that we used

311
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:49,850
before with Google Chrome but we changed

312
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:51,980
the account object now we are using a

313
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:56,270
common object that isn't native in

314
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:58,400
Windows 10 and in Windows 8 I don't know

315
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:00,830
which other windows but at least I tried

316
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:05,740
to do it in Windows 10 and windows 8 and

317
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:10,659
it's works here windows will load our

318
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:12,650
our malicious DLL and at the starting

319
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:15,080
let's see the video and pay attention

320
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:19,550
because it is the best way to proceed

321
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:23,110
at least my favorite one here we have

322
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:26,120
two machines the attacker one and the

323
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:30,500
target machine and the record has some

324
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:33,050
sessions in the target machine but the

325
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:36,410
user restores the record loss

326
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:41,030
the session and without persistent it's

327
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:44,230
the end but we widow persistence using

328
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:50,570
the technique that we we saw recently

329
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:55,180
so when the users rights they they Carol

330
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:55,179
his password windows we love

331
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,970
that's right

332
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:50,920
hi-yah perfect okay did you see the

333
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:54,049
video do you want to see a game okay

334
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:57,799
okay the attacker receives the the meta

335
00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:59,650
protestations and when the user writes

336
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:04,520
his password help our words and

337
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:07,220
authenticate so it's good because the

338
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:10,270
best policies is that native account of

339
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:12,290
Ships unloaded before any program

340
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:15,410
including the antivirus

341
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:17,690
so we assert occurs which received a

342
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:21,320
connection before the antivirus starts

343
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:26,830
so it cannot detect us and delete the

344
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:30,049
memoir good for attackers the synapse

345
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:33,530
application and native objects are

346
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:36,918
vulnerable to kaha shock and can be used

347
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:39,950
to make many word persistence and again

348
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:43,549
the attacker doesn't need admin

349
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:48,710
privilege to do this even its work on

350
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:51,410
standard Windows accounts and even in

351
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:53,780
the last techniques even we can do a

352
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:56,870
contract to natively come options

353
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:58,820
without admin rights this is a super

354
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:01,459
super stealthy metal because it's very

355
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:04,189
hard to detect that there is a culture

356
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:07,330
shock in our system is is window which

357
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:09,530
is love in our malicious DLL and

358
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:12,168
remember the recommendation use

359
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:16,940
PowerShell to bypass the restrictions to

360
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:18,650
alter the president because it's again

361
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:23,140
it's not a problem because PowerShell is

362
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:23,140
available by default in all the systems

363
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:29,929
let's go to the last technique

364
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:34,460
persistent using extension hundred hi

365
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:37,970
shots and if we go to the classes routes

366
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:41,840
paths in the registry we can find all

367
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:45,740
the extensions that our system is able

368
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:48,678
to handle and we can see what is the

369
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:52,160
problem responsible of that for example

370
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:52,690
here we can see that VLC is a program

371
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:59,259
that

372
00:22:52,690 --> 00:23:02,859
handle the mp4 extensions um if we go to

373
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:06,190
the in the st. pat's if we go to the to

374
00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:10,899
the PLC program key we can see the open

375
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:12,849
command and we can see what well what we

376
00:23:10,899 --> 00:23:16,539
will take the comment that will be

377
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:22,210
executed when the user clicks on an mp4

378
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:24,940
file we could change this but remember

379
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:27,759
that we are below the classes root key

380
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:30,129
so we are not able to modify anything

381
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:33,460
here it is both that we cannot modify

382
00:23:30,129 --> 00:23:43,899
anything here because it's only allowed

383
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:48,429
or admin accounts but I don't know why

384
00:23:43,899 --> 00:23:52,209
but if we create the common the keys

385
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:54,340
below the users key in the registry

386
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:59,229
below the path that we can see in the

387
00:23:54,340 --> 00:24:01,658
screen we can overwrite the main conmen

388
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:03,639
the main key we can overwrite the

389
00:24:01,659 --> 00:24:09,070
comment that will be executed when the

390
00:24:03,639 --> 00:24:12,758
users open an mp4 file so we can change

391
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:16,059
this and execute meterpreter dot exe

392
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:18,970
file we are not dealing with come

393
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:22,779
options right now so that's why we can

394
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:29,289
we are using but yet he files instead

395
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:32,369
comm options instead DLL so again we can

396
00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:37,210
use a PowerShell script this time for

397
00:24:32,369 --> 00:24:40,899
right the key for open for overwrite the

398
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:43,929
open command of the PLC and replace the

399
00:24:40,899 --> 00:24:48,928
original one to execute a malicious file

400
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:52,570
instead the PLC program but let's do a

401
00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:55,590
simple proof of concept we will execute

402
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:59,049
a calculator when they use our open an

403
00:24:55,590 --> 00:25:02,080
mp4 file because there are something

404
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:05,950
that I want to yo show that we have to

405
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:09,129
fix he will have our empty

406
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:12,220
for file and when the users do clicks

407
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:15,340
way around the calculator and it's good

408
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:18,960
because this works but we have a problem

409
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:22,600
because the user is not seen the movie

410
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:25,120
so probably he or she will will think

411
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:28,000
that the computer is not working fine

412
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,850
and probably will form athletics and we

413
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:35,440
will lost the person so we have to fix

414
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:38,408
this I thought that it will be nice is

415
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:42,220
we can execute the malware and the

416
00:25:38,409 --> 00:25:46,179
original program I developed a kind of

417
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:48,730
proxy that executes the the malware and

418
00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:52,510
receive as parameters the original

419
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:57,130
comment to open a file I developed this

420
00:25:52,510 --> 00:26:00,639
single it's a very simple code as you

421
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:03,760
can see we are executing the meterpreter

422
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:06,939
dot exe and then we are receiving the

423
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:11,889
arguments so the original comment to be

424
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:15,610
executed and open the file let's see

425
00:26:11,889 --> 00:26:20,769
what happened now again with having word

426
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:23,610
dot mp4 file and the attacker machine

427
00:26:20,769 --> 00:26:27,190
waiting for the meta browser session

428
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:30,299
when the user open will receive the

429
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:33,190
connection and the users see the movie

430
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:37,149
it's good because it's very transparent

431
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:40,330
for the user even we can do a high shock

432
00:26:37,149 --> 00:26:42,699
to all these tensions each want with a

433
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:47,019
high shock to and before but we can do

434
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:50,409
it to txt or even to all extensions I'll

435
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:55,590
execute memoir in a transparent way to

436
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:58,330
the user to sign up this third technique

437
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:59,889
we can use shall extensive handlers to

438
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:02,408
make my word persistence

439
00:26:59,889 --> 00:27:05,949
again the attacker doesn't need

440
00:27:02,409 --> 00:27:08,380
privileged to do things we can alter all

441
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:12,429
the handlers without asking for any

442
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:14,279
permission it's a steady metals and in

443
00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:18,429
this game with don't need PowerShell

444
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:19,330
because we can modify the edge key you

445
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:24,629
precious

446
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:27,489
without restrictions as completion

447
00:27:24,629 --> 00:27:31,719
features because Microsoft called them

448
00:27:27,489 --> 00:27:33,970
features the windows we can use them to

449
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:36,700
abuse abuse them to make my work

450
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:40,269
persistence sales here and more

451
00:27:36,700 --> 00:28:01,350
sophisticated oh I hope you like this

452
00:27:40,269 --> 00:28:01,350
bug and thank you questions

453
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:25,010
but you can use these a by the way thank

454
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:28,250
you for the time

455
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:31,370
well it's all about integrity checking

456
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:35,690
integrity if you know software like

457
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:39,679
other kids you can detect your DOL you

458
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:45,620
can detect your shell script and you

459
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:51,520
just use if your user using whitelisting

460
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:56,780
you know you can't detect this software

461
00:28:51,520 --> 00:29:00,950
and it's so very interesting type of

462
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:05,420
detection if you know system internals

463
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:12,260
system on yeah you can write your own

464
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:14,120
policy about your hash and if has

465
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:17,000
changes cause you're injecting

466
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:20,479
interpreters you can detect using this

467
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,840
month thank you yes it's true yeah you

468
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:27,140
have to to try to detect a malicious DLL

469
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:30,020
is the easy way to stop this attack

470
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:31,940
because you cannot detect that maybe you

471
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,889
cannot do that that is a kind of

472
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:38,170
contract but you can detect that is a

473
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:38,170
malicious DLL running in the system

474
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:43,700
yes you heard you can check what's the

475
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:47,410
DLL are loading but you have to inspect

476
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:48,840
the DLL to know that is a malicious one

477
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:52,000
another question

478
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,000
[Music]

479
00:29:55,610 --> 00:30:03,229
oh thank you for your talk in the last

480
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:06,010
video you showed how you develop the

481
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:11,320
proxy to make your program a stealth but

482
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:11,320
in the first and the second cut when you

483
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:18,710
exploited the right click the menu

484
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:22,760
didn't pop up so and the chrome didn't

485
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:27,770
opened is there any way to make itself

486
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:29,660
as in the last video yes you are asking

487
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:33,620
if we can run Google Chrome for example

488
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:35,840
yes if we could perform some I don't

489
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:40,729
know maybe modification on our exploit

490
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:45,199
and in the first in the second trick you

491
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:49,090
showed us also make it more sense for

492
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:52,490
user yes we can improve the the other

493
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:56,000
idea that kind of proof of concept but

494
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:58,010
we can improve it to execute the Google

495
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,350
Chrome the the application that we have

496
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:02,420
to execute it was just a proof of

497
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:05,929
