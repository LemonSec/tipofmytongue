1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:12,540
operating actually people have told me

2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:15,030
that I'm going to be the last speaker in

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,970
this session so if I'm going to go for

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:22,789
too long please let me know and tell the

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:25,710
organizers of the events that i'm

6
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:31,279
alexandra bakker voice from Red Hat and

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:34,230
I'm in charge of the development of the

8
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:38,219
authentication and registration of the

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:41,370
users actually it sounds pretty rough in

10
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:44,930
Russian and it's kind of hard to

11
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:48,199
translate you should notice that

12
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:50,910
actually on the slide it's written

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:54,690
slightly differently than it was written

14
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:56,610
on our gender but that's just how tough

15
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,180
it is to translate from English into

16
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:02,370
Russian in proper terms as it were I

17
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,199
would like to start from a very

18
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,470
interesting anniversary seems like it's

19
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:10,470
this year that's been 40 years ever

20
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:17,610
since we started using those functions

21
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:22,408
get aw Nam get Yui UI I mean and so

22
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:31,380
forth at the system level

23
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:38,810
that's API version 780 UNIX it was 40

24
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:38,810
years ago in 79 and some of those

25
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:50,830
have so far been fixed the users

26
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:54,940
information would belong to different

27
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:57,480
files and approximately in 1993 the Sun

28
00:01:54,940 --> 00:02:01,360
Microsystems had developed the Solaris

29
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:08,940
version which would add the name service

30
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:12,280
switch which is a mechanism of login and

31
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:15,880
it allowed to use different mechanisms

32
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:21,280
and different methods of data storage

33
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:23,920
for the users it needed to support needs

34
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,190
and other moments but later they started

35
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:31,239
to using it for other purposes in terms

36
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:35,070
of authentication such a mechanism which

37
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:40,810
would allow us to build in plugins

38
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:45,010
appeared in 1995 which was not far away

39
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:47,770
from 1993 it was the UNIX system

40
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:54,130
authentication in 1997 approximately

41
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:57,370
since then Linux Pam started getting

42
00:02:54,130 --> 00:03:00,340
implemented so if we take a look at what

43
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:04,209
we have been using at the low system

44
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:07,980
level at the system library level has

45
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:14,230
been in existence without significant

46
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:17,560
changes but for 40 at least 25 years to

47
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:19,540
say the least so on the one hand it says

48
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,200
that the people who had developed those

49
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:24,609
interfaces were actually thinking

50
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,440
properly because they have stood the

51
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:31,209
test of time that's on the one hand on

52
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:34,000
the other hand I guess that nobody

53
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:36,880
nobody really wanted to break the

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,720
existence solutions that much and that

55
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:42,850
evolution that was not a revolution with

56
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:46,550
evolution rather it was a pretty slow

57
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:50,060
process and those changes had

58
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:52,610
occurred in the 1990s like Kerberos

59
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:56,660
dates back even to the nineteen eighties

60
00:03:52,610 --> 00:04:00,620
and nice goes back to 1992 and then

61
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:03,109
Microsoft Microsoft took them all over

62
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:07,490
all those UNIX solutions and packaged

63
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:11,390
them in 1998 into an active directory

64
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:15,470
and it started getting used the

65
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:20,000
industrial-scale and it remained in such

66
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:24,980
a state ever since this is the finished

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:28,640
picture those graduates school graduates

68
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:32,300
would go on to such trucks dressed in

69
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:35,750
very interesting clothes and those are

70
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:39,200
the gradients from the 1990s that they

71
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:42,590
are on the parade ever since we have not

72
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:45,950
had much breakthrough so we deal with

73
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:49,369
technologies that date back to 20 years

74
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:53,570
something and these standard solutions

75
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:57,010
have grown there are different solutions

76
00:04:53,570 --> 00:05:03,770
which allow to use different protocols

77
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:06,770
that I have mentioned to communicate and

78
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:08,750
this multitude of system says on the one

79
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:10,940
hand good and dear on the other hand

80
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:14,840
it's pretty bad so which helps us

81
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:18,680
resolve on result different tasks but on

82
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:22,060
the other hand vendor wise the vendor

83
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:25,850
that supports the base operating systems

84
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:28,419
seems to have a problem because he needs

85
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:32,060
to test all those interoperability

86
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:35,450
things in terms of interoperability of

87
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:42,530
the modules plus even more if you take a

88
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:45,530
look at the usage NSS and Pam Red Hat

89
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:48,770
Enterprise Linux 7 would look

90
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:51,799
approximately like the ones I am showing

91
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:55,130
you on this slide naturally there are

92
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,930
modules that people would install on

93
00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:00,610
their own

94
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:05,590
but we believe that these are the

95
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:10,120
modules provided by SS SD the system

96
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:15,599
library module the standard pam modules

97
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:18,970
that belong to all of the linux's from

98
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:23,380
five and ten eleven which I will

99
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:29,199
elaborate and NSS and ten modules from

100
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:33,990
Samba and SS in spann modules from L tab

101
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:41,800
D project these modules seem to do quite

102
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:44,560
nicely but they have long-term common

103
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,860
problems that date back with their

104
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,690
sources to a couple of dozens years ago

105
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:54,849
because lots of modules have been

106
00:06:49,690 --> 00:07:00,370
created having in mind the actual take

107
00:06:54,849 --> 00:07:02,740
on them in the 1990s so to be more clear

108
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:06,070
those modules would be uploaded to the

109
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:08,410
calling application directly so if

110
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:12,780
that's the NSS module that would have to

111
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:15,130
connect to the LDAP server a remote one

112
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:17,710
basically it means that into your

113
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:21,000
address space there is a module

114
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:22,270
springing up with the LDAP library

115
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,470
uploader

116
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:31,060
which would have to have an access to an

117
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:35,099
account of a specific user which had

118
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:39,159
configure eight configured that module

119
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:45,130
etc in other words what we have here is

120
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:48,969
the heterogeneous approach so this is so

121
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:53,889
these users would get access to more

122
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:57,610
information rather than they need to so

123
00:07:53,889 --> 00:08:01,570
then there was a need to isolate it and

124
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:06,580
put this into smaller modules so that

125
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:07,639
the modules would interact via the UNIX

126
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:13,068
domain

127
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:19,310
socket this is what the NSS palm l-dub D

128
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:24,379
works this is what some other ones work

129
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:27,319
that have been with us for the last 15

130
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:30,080
years and these modules were all

131
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:33,469
targeted at the local tasks they were

132
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:37,549
not about deployed they were not to be

133
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:42,320
deployed at some hundreds and thousands

134
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:44,510
of machines and as far as the user

135
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,899
limitations are concerned the user

136
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:50,300
rights are concerned all these user

137
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:52,779
rights would have to be deployed to all

138
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:56,569
of these hundreds of machines so

139
00:08:52,779 --> 00:09:00,410
ultimately it would all get pretty

140
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:02,029
clumsy and the maintenance of such

141
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:04,610
modules was also getting pretty

142
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:07,459
difficult yet there is another problem

143
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:10,250
we all get older when I just started

144
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:16,219
doing that I was a very young kid I was

145
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:19,190
just 18 now I'm over 40 and there is yet

146
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:24,500
a new generation of the people who can

147
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:28,339
cope with this and this topic is not

148
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:31,490
that attractive for younger guys for the

149
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:33,740
younger developers because this topic

150
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:36,649
does not look that interesting and

151
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,600
attractive for them they have better

152
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:40,399
things to do more attractive things to

153
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,110
do it seems like that these projects

154
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:47,510
that I'm talking about are simply dying

155
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:51,199
out some people go and new people do not

156
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:55,189
come and some of them change their mind

157
00:09:51,199 --> 00:10:00,079
and start doing something else so in

158
00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:04,320
terms of Red Hat Enterprise Linux which

159
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:06,719
has 1012 years of support

160
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:13,320
you know we'd have to work with with the

161
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:20,880
projects that have to be buried with the

162
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:23,220
creators and be along gone forgotten so

163
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,250
therefore naturally people tend to say

164
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:30,329
no to some projects and ten years ago

165
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:35,480
started the SSD project which would try

166
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:37,079
to uniformly represent the access to the

167
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:42,750
user data

168
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:46,229
the authentication the authentication

169
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:53,610
for the different systems primarily for

170
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:58,620
Linux in many standard distributive the

171
00:10:53,610 --> 00:11:00,769
main tasks for SSD is to take from the

172
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,240
modules that are loaded to the

173
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:07,230
application all the meaningful part of

174
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:11,130
the work so that the application would

175
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:14,209
not have anything as far as the leakage

176
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:17,730
is concerned so it's all on the back end

177
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:22,279
in the different context under a

178
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:25,829
different user so with this particular

179
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:30,630
framework with this particular tool with

180
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:36,300
more functions added to it we provide

181
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:43,680
the seamless integration of Linux to

182
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:49,410
different systems with the Active

183
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:52,739
Directory environment and with the

184
00:11:49,410 --> 00:12:01,290
standard al-jabr CalPERS environments as

185
00:11:52,740 --> 00:12:06,839
well in terms of the modules belonging

186
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:17,819
to Red Hat Enterprise Linux with get rid

187
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:20,730
of two modules found pix11 and NSSI LDAP

188
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:25,319
and pom LDAP they are rendered obsolete

189
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:27,920
and will be removed from the upcoming

190
00:12:25,319 --> 00:12:34,189
versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux

191
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:36,059
because those tasks are covered

192
00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:40,949
completely and they are no longer

193
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:44,939
required so I will start with Pam care

194
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:48,469
be five-pump care b5 is responsible for

195
00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:51,209
the authentication of the users by the

196
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:55,019
utilization of the Kerberos keys it

197
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:58,859
looks simple but there are subtleties

198
00:12:55,019 --> 00:13:03,600
hidden capparis is not in charge of the

199
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:06,029
user authentication as such so at the

200
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:10,130
operating system level there should be

201
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:17,819
the transformation conducted by that

202
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:27,300
recognition principle so that we'd be

203
00:13:17,819 --> 00:13:32,610
able to work with the user there must be

204
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:36,319
a chart the transformation chart not

205
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,319
normally it was static

206
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,760
imagine there are millions of users and

207
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:47,380
you would have to be able to have 50,000

208
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,050
users to connect to that machine you'll

209
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:52,959
have to arraign the return manually and

210
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:55,990
that's not the case that's not how it

211
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:58,989
should be done so on the one hand we

212
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:00,839
tried to find cameras in the library and

213
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:08,709
tried changing it

214
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:11,829
adding the login possibility and then we

215
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:14,439
added the login on the SSD side because

216
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:19,589
they are aware of this user they know

217
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,589
what this user is all about in terms of

218
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:26,890
this system and they know what would be

219
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:32,500
the user Kerberos or Active Directory

220
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:36,970
name etc etc but here is a special

221
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:40,480
feature when we speak about Pam care b5

222
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:44,370
there are actually two modules having

223
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:47,440
one same name and they tend to be

224
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:49,570
confused with one another there are

225
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:55,360
completely different but they're named

226
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:57,610
one of the red hat ones been rendered

227
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,149
obsolete hands been deleted the other

228
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:08,829
one B has a lot library from the Debian

229
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:13,120
project the other one does exist but it

230
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:18,729
has not been committed to for the over

231
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:22,180
the last two years the only initial Pam

232
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:24,820
care b5 function which is not supported

233
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:28,630
with is the token generation for Andrew

234
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:31,660
file system that is not very commonly

235
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:33,399
used by a loss of customers but for that

236
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,750
purpose there is a standalone module

237
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:37,150
which

238
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:40,360
allow us to generate such a session and

239
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:43,380
there there is a detailed instruction on

240
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:47,070
how to do that and this smart cards

241
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:51,490
access the traditional smart card access

242
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:56,140
to the system locally or remotely this

243
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:59,860
module is pretty nice and highly

244
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:04,030
developed it has a capability of

245
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:09,610
changing the names that we get in a

246
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:12,400
certificate to the user names it has

247
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:14,620
such a function but it's all tuned

248
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:21,819
locally and they all have to cascade it

249
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:24,820
down all of the machines anyway and we

250
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:29,320
did that with a number of customers of

251
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:33,640
Red Hat with different US governments

252
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:38,880
that all use such cards and they added

253
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:44,530
the login support with a smart card

254
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:46,840
capability and like three or four years

255
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:49,660
ago they did this capability and then

256
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:56,140
they expanded the ability of storing

257
00:16:49,660 --> 00:17:00,730
this data in a centralized way so you

258
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:04,000
you just change this in the Active

259
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:06,849
Directory in a centralized way and then

260
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,770
as cascaded down automatically and in

261
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:15,010
the RSS 8 they added the rollback

262
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:18,849
capability when you just need to tune it

263
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:23,379
for the users that are the local users

264
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:28,780
only thus we have covered all the

265
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:31,660
functions by damn take ACS 11 and the D

266
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:34,420
actual developer had announced a few

267
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:38,080
years ago that if there's no one who

268
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:40,690
would like to take the mission from them

269
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,850
they would discontinue anyway for

270
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:45,850
various reasons they would discontinue

271
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:47,010
for not having enough enough time for

272
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:51,480
some

273
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:54,780
private issues some issues like that

274
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:57,350
they are very common reasons for people

275
00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:03,000
stopping their work on their solutions

276
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:05,209
some time ago people found time and they

277
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,160
started generating the requests and

278
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:10,950
started going through all of the

279
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:16,830
requests that had had accumulated since

280
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:23,220
2016 people would find errors and such

281
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:25,110
errors could be exploited to use them to

282
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,900
gain access to the system and for three

283
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:29,639
years nothing had been done just for

284
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:33,000
that simple reason that it was not a

285
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:39,560
commercial project it was a free of

286
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:45,000
charge based one and if we move from

287
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:48,330
eleven to SSD all the functions are they

288
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,750
are in SSD anyway but to make good use

289
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:56,220
of that you should be capable of tuning

290
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:59,450
the whole system up and and since 1999

291
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:02,700
there's been a module in the Red Hat

292
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:06,500
distributive that is familiar to most of

293
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:11,070
you off config it's a utility which has

294
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:15,060
gathered all this logic of how to put

295
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:20,189
the palm and SS which all these files so

296
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:21,960
that they would be able to run with all

297
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:24,650
of these parameters that people would

298
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,300
like to get like the fingerprint

299
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:31,140
authentication the smart card

300
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:34,320
authentication plus some more so that

301
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:36,780
utility had become quite heavy to

302
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,629
maintain and support and each time when

303
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:42,450
the question was asked should we rewrite

304
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:46,290
the code really the Creator would say

305
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:50,910
well you know if I touch it here it

306
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:54,690
would crumble there so a couple of years

307
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:58,170
ago they said that's it . i'm not going

308
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:59,500
to touch it even if you pay me i don't

309
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,940
really want to

310
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:08,710
seniors so we decided to take a

311
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:13,300
different loan cut that you can figure

312
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:16,570
out some activities drive it podcast du

313
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:18,490
chateau de staat see the emotions have

314
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:22,540
seemed so pretty piece of it configured

315
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:24,940
so no file you've practiced King yet as

316
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:31,629
I advanced lip resource lost and riches

317
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:35,490
ad set a schedule don't conclude usually

318
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:39,250
potato dragoman no really post was also

319
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:42,660
a t-shirt what's a traverse to boy

320
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:47,470
rabbit is configured see a tourist and I

321
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:49,630
noticed Iranian in order to develop the

322
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:52,290
kind of configurations and it would be

323
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:56,590
easier to support they are

324
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:59,409
understandable both on the side of those

325
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:01,449
who use it and on the side of those who

326
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,720
answer the questions from those who use

327
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:04,380
it

328
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,640
another interesting trend is that

329
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,180
developers are sponsoring and policies

330
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,570
admins

331
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:14,320
is a different case settlements are

332
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:16,840
quite young and they come from spheres

333
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,760
that never dealt with UNIX was the

334
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:22,780
traditional unix approaches was they

335
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:27,850
conveyor about between you know call

336
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:32,410
utility they are used to other stuff in

337
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:34,830
the woman run it appeared that when you

338
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:37,840
would get a call to the call center

339
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:40,300
rather than trying and solve the problem

340
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,000
of a specific configuration you have to

341
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:46,149
actually go ahead and explain the

342
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,670
concept how UNIX system works what it

343
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:50,680
what was in it the whole generation

344
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:52,780
changed and the spectrum of people who

345
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,210
are involved in dealing with it has

346
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:56,770
changed and to say that you can just

347
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:58,510
launch this you till there was this

348
00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:01,179
parameters and there you go everything

349
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:04,408
would work is not enough

350
00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:07,359
I give an example here of a challenge

351
00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:12,969
one it was actually not launched by a

352
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:21,718
human inside of setting script for F

353
00:22:12,969 --> 00:22:27,489
print D a utility that inputs Damon on

354
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:30,489
fingerprints application so there was a

355
00:22:27,489 --> 00:22:34,599
call one you it would call disabled

356
00:22:30,489 --> 00:22:37,479
fingerprint option and it would write

357
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:41,349
over all the other sadness it would

358
00:22:37,479 --> 00:22:44,229
delete the module of control of a

359
00:22:41,349 --> 00:22:45,729
fingerprint and overrides the whole

360
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:51,029
configuration of the system and the

361
00:22:45,729 --> 00:22:53,830
system was no longer capable to login

362
00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:56,440
thankfully it was caught in federal

363
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:58,809
rather than in distributor but it was

364
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,089
one of the points when we realized the

365
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:03,178
situation has changed we really need to

366
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:07,989
rewrite the whole thing the whole thing

367
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:10,629
well so we have all select that has

368
00:23:07,989 --> 00:23:14,469
three basic recommendations the one that

369
00:23:10,629 --> 00:23:20,668
is used by SSD by default another

370
00:23:14,469 --> 00:23:25,239
configuration that uses pom and this has

371
00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:28,919
win bind to integrate with other systems

372
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:31,239
like exterior Vittori and the obsolete

373
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:36,899
nice-nice is obsolete for support in

374
00:23:31,239 --> 00:23:40,989
certain spheres applications fears when

375
00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:43,449
uses with Bernice are they are more

376
00:23:40,989 --> 00:23:45,519
lightweight its high-performance cluster

377
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:48,249
systems where you have computations and

378
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:51,190
you have to send thousands of machines

379
00:23:48,249 --> 00:23:55,619
and the tasks so for those who need to

380
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:58,629
execute them and the certain share like

381
00:23:55,619 --> 00:24:02,168
200 milliseconds or 20 milliseconds it's

382
00:23:58,629 --> 00:24:06,869
a big difference right how this users

383
00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:06,869
are resolved for systems of this kind

384
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:16,350
so the target for all select was to tune

385
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:22,270
the identification system and

386
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:24,699
registering systems to make it usable if

387
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:27,190
you want to make your own configurations

388
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:31,800
yes you can write additional profiles

389
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:36,640
but they are not going to be kind of

390
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:40,649
module and combined able there is a

391
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,650
certain functional that you can permit

392
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:48,520
like automated creation of home

393
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:53,410
directories or the use of SSD in order

394
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:56,650
to drag public keys for machines and it

395
00:24:53,410 --> 00:25:00,250
uses an automatical again through SSS HL

396
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:03,400
and these are the features inside the

397
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:05,260
separate profile if you create separate

398
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:11,740
another profile and you identify your

399
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:15,180
own features and you have to be

400
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:18,670
accountable for each of the profile and

401
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:21,490
ensuring test specific associations for

402
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:25,200
each of them in order to migrate from

403
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:31,030
the legacy systems a special module was

404
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:36,720
created in config so in the rel 8 you

405
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:42,010
would find it it translates the most

406
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:45,820
frequent calls into the Select calls so

407
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:49,090
all this is nice it's all new there is a

408
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:54,189
fun example of one case when the fact

409
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:55,810
that you need to support certain modules

410
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:57,720
for a certain period of time and you

411
00:25:55,810 --> 00:26:04,060
cannot just go ahead and throw it out

412
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:07,590
actually played voiceless

413
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:12,070
there was this project that made use of

414
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:14,740
dns to store users credential not pass

415
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:16,020
codes not passwords but information on

416
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:18,150
users

417
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:22,379
somebody saw that it's

418
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:27,750
a good thing that you can put it in DNS

419
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:31,290
server it's a distributed and it's a

420
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:35,850
load resistance kind of thing so it has

421
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:39,500
your project no longer it is no longer

422
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:44,939
used but then Red Hat Enterprise Linux

423
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:47,880
and hazard support in Red Hat is inside

424
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:52,550
the document that's called application

425
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:55,770
compatibility guide that is Huestis

426
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:59,280
guarantee that we give in Redis respect

427
00:26:55,770 --> 00:27:02,010
to the interfaces it's on level one

428
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:12,680
which means that within three major

429
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:15,420
versions we don't have right not to

430
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:19,170
change anything or throw anything away

431
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:24,840
and when we launched round eight we just

432
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:30,270
automatically added back on level one so

433
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:34,649
seven eight eight nine ten the major

434
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:37,260
versions only in the tenth version it

435
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:42,060
can be thrown out although there are no

436
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:44,430
longer any users of this module to throw

437
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:50,149
this code out of the distributive would

438
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:53,640
actually decrease the attack surface

439
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:57,210
because the attacker can actually make

440
00:27:53,640 --> 00:28:02,700
your system might make your machine use

441
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:08,430
the system similarly was miss this that

442
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:11,930
created it was created back in 89 Ness

443
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:19,230
plus in 92 is still used although it's

444
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:20,790
insecure to store open hashes and not

445
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:24,680
encrypted

446
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:29,610
in the prodigal that doesn't have any

447
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:33,390
any kind of channel encryption is fast

448
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:35,060
but not secure at all it's very very

449
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:37,590
very inappropriate and unacceptable

450
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:41,639
there are certain tasks where such

451
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:47,280
clients are indeed used and in demand

452
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:50,700
and so together with customers of this

453
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:52,440
kind we decided to get rid of this

454
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,030
server in the next major version the

455
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,860
client will be still there but then

456
00:28:54,030 --> 00:29:00,320
we'll have to part with the client as

457
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:03,360
well hopefully by this time some other

458
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:08,010
protocols would come by and live with

459
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:10,439
rice the performance but as far as the

460
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:20,720
cipher channels is concerned it's still

461
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:20,720
a big issue as far as LDAP is concerned

462
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:31,740
last fall there was a lot of noise

463
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:35,520
around several opal depth going out of

464
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:39,300
RAL and Red Hat Enterprise the next

465
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:46,590
eight just hum it so it's about several

466
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:51,600
things first off Red Hat doesn't have a

467
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:54,870
team to work on open LDAP and from my

468
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:57,149
personal experience working with

469
00:29:54,870 --> 00:30:01,250
upstream of open LDAP is a challenging

470
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:04,800
task just to give you an example at San

471
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:06,870
Line patch that would just add the

472
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:10,290
already existence functioning to open

473
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:12,330
end up in the publicly accessible file

474
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:14,250
so that others would be able to use

475
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:16,830
these libraries while the function has

476
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:20,370
already existed would only be possible

477
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:21,570
in the next major release of open LD

478
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:25,010
LDAP

479
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:29,879
elaborate so two years have passed and

480
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:31,560
this is just about relocation of

481
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,870
existing code

482
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:36,629
it's that complicated or the other hand

483
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:39,510
there are companies that are prepared to

484
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:42,650
support open LDAP and they have much

485
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:46,830
greater experience in doing that and

486
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:51,450
they would be happy to enter this nation

487
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:55,830
to cover this gap open LDAP libraries

488
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:58,770
are being used because they are in sea

489
00:30:55,830 --> 00:31:02,100
and they support all the Soltys of this

490
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:04,170
protocol they're going to still exist

491
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:07,939
only without server there's an

492
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:07,940
alternative alternative to this server

493
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:18,750
380 90s in particular the directory

494
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:22,170
server that's his that uses Red Hat

495
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:26,730
directory server so you can just have a

496
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:30,240
run on diem and you can then execute

497
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:33,870
it's over there with support on higher

498
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:38,630
level so you have it on the other hand

499
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:41,340
all these systems are nice but they are

500
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:45,180
supposed to be used together with

501
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:48,709
something we have the system to tackle

502
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:52,970
our tasks right not just out of the blue

503
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:59,490
so one of the layers in the system

504
00:31:52,970 --> 00:32:04,680
modules in web server actually we had a

505
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:09,380
whole set of modules and they resolve

506
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:14,220
various tasks from for Kerberos

507
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:15,840
authentication we used to use the module

508
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:18,660
that he hung on the slide when we are

509
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:21,980
going to use a different module that

510
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:25,020
read from scratch when we systematically

511
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:29,340
started to going from low level and

512
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:32,430
going to the high level a server that

513
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:35,000
allows us to do a lot of nice things in

514
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:35,000
terms of security

515
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:41,300
as far as a certification for

516
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,610
certificates we used to support more

517
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:49,700
than the sass and now we'd get away from

518
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:56,750
it for the sake of consolidation on mod

519
00:32:49,700 --> 00:33:01,070
SSL mode Auto kerb is almost dead nobody

520
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:03,560
is doing anything as far as rewriting

521
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:07,850
the whole set of applications it has

522
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:18,830
already been finalized that route two

523
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:24,110
years before this particular talk around

524
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:28,270
ten years ago rad had had its take on an

525
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:30,889
assess it's a crypto library on Mozilla

526
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:33,050
Netscape started to write it Netscape

527
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:35,630
actually if you if you happen to know

528
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:38,930
about from the browser pond they also

529
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:42,140
had a server parts they wanted to create

530
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:47,060
a vertical they had a nut scape

531
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:54,800
directory server that I made several

532
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:57,560
acquisitions mergers and became the guy

533
00:33:54,800 --> 00:34:01,250
that also rat had on the other hand they

534
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:04,340
had browser yet on the other hand they

535
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:09,310
had a system for writing certification

536
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:09,310
that same kind of registry center

537
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:17,368
the only thing that Mozilla still has is

538
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:21,609
the browser support and crypto libraries

539
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:25,329
printer libraries are great because they

540
00:34:21,609 --> 00:34:30,549
allow to work with smart cards were

541
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:33,999
special tokens it's better than open SSL

542
00:34:30,549 --> 00:34:37,268
in this respect but upstream NSS the

543
00:34:33,998 --> 00:34:39,908
Mozilla developers they think that this

544
00:34:37,268 --> 00:34:42,668
library is basically part of Firefox

545
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:45,249
it's a and they don't view it as an

546
00:34:42,668 --> 00:34:51,509
external library so they keep changing

547
00:34:45,248 --> 00:34:54,638
say P eyes and cosmetics not just titles

548
00:34:51,509 --> 00:35:01,240
so the name is unchanged but semantics

549
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:04,480
semantics has changed so we couldn't go

550
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:07,299
to an assess we started to go to SSL

551
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:13,089
with modest SSL it turned out to be much

552
00:35:07,299 --> 00:35:17,140
more simple much simpler but for modern

553
00:35:13,089 --> 00:35:20,349
assess there was a a locator model that

554
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:26,170
would allow us to go through the list of

555
00:35:20,349 --> 00:35:28,450
certificates and make sure we don't use

556
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:30,579
the ones that were revoked by the

557
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:32,589
special listing and this river kata was

558
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:35,380
done I would would do this check up

559
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:36,970
automatically and that's all you don't

560
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:41,470
do it automatically you have to do it

561
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:43,749
kind of through external integration but

562
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:46,269
it's not not not too complicated and

563
00:35:43,749 --> 00:35:50,680
there are examples of people doing it in

564
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:56,078
cameras they added added new functions

565
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:59,980
are we going to have more in the next

566
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:06,609
release they minor release as compared

567
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:10,150
to 7 we have KCM support added cameras

568
00:36:06,609 --> 00:36:15,808
credential manager KCM and as we try to

569
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:15,809
rewrite most of code to use gssb a

570
00:36:16,589 --> 00:36:23,589
low-level cameras a Cobra's function

571
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:27,960
certain elaborate especially

572
00:36:23,589 --> 00:36:32,710
pasen ones were no longer necessary and

573
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:38,670
substituted by poison GSS api and Jesus

574
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:42,880
cast abiy I can see em is a mechanism of

575
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:46,329
storing Cobras tickets in MIT Cobras a

576
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,950
library they used to have three four

577
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:52,450
more depending on platform we're

578
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:54,640
referring to more often than not they

579
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:56,439
are stored in files and directories when

580
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:00,960
you need a lot of tickets for various

581
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,960
realms stored simultaneously or in

582
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:12,660
keyring the O'Malley memory but this a

583
00:37:07,029 --> 00:37:19,269
part of the memory it's not subject to

584
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:21,700
the username space it doesn't work so if

585
00:37:19,269 --> 00:37:23,950
you have a lot of containers and you

586
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:25,899
want to use Kerberos saying this

587
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:27,960
convenient keyring cannot be used

588
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:32,319
because any of the container would see

589
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:39,599
the contents of the global caring if

590
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:42,788
they say launched in the same user

591
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:45,999
gaseum is a server client protocol

592
00:37:42,789 --> 00:37:51,150
through UNIX domain socket units among

593
00:37:45,999 --> 00:37:51,149
UNIX the main circ socket is

594
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:59,520
you know it's something that can be

595
00:37:54,710 --> 00:38:05,100
petitioned and use in certain criteria

596
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:07,619
containers such as the stores this in

597
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:13,589
its database and can make a lot of

598
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:17,520
interesting stuff like updating the

599
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:24,300
tickets or restoring them after reboot

600
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:28,550
if they are still usable in force as far

601
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:35,580
as global stuff is concerned that uses

602
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:41,700
excuse of all this functional rel8 added

603
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:46,440
something called modules it's a

604
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:52,560
mechanism for extension of repositories

605
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:55,380
that allows to manage several streams of

606
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:59,190
the same application or packages

607
00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:01,080
independent of each other so you cannot

608
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:03,720
put them in parallel in one system but

609
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:08,000
you can get access to them in parallel

610
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:17,299
so if in your repository you would have

611
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:20,280
four or five types of not GS or Postgres

612
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:24,590
then on different machines you can put

613
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,590
various versions but you won't have to

614
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:31,350
break your hide around how to store it

615
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:33,710
and give permissions within one

616
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:33,710
repository

617
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:40,560
besides it gives you the opportunity to

618
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:44,270
make groups of packages on the level of

619
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:48,150
models but not the global repository

620
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:51,780
this is the way you can create profiles

621
00:39:48,150 --> 00:40:00,180
for Postgres server from DM all the

622
00:39:51,780 --> 00:40:02,490
service that would locally within this

623
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:05,910
that model resolve into the packages

624
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:09,660
specific of this model in case of IDM

625
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:12,420
were created to of flows like that in

626
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:14,580
one flow what is called IDM client and

627
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:19,050
it only contains clients library and it

628
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:22,549
is switched on by default so I should

629
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:31,500
you switch room and switch it to the

630
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:34,920
existing server from config kickstart it

631
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:43,500
would keep working and the nothing as a

632
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:47,160
server component it's a separate one and

633
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:49,980
if we change this server part then the

634
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:51,200
incompatible changes would be in a

635
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:55,020
separate module it would have a

636
00:40:51,200 --> 00:41:00,509
different name and that way we ensure a

637
00:40:55,020 --> 00:41:02,610
more stable structure and we or the

638
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:06,510
other hand gets a more stable mechanism

639
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:12,910
for planning updates and changes

640
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:16,829
the outlet we already had upstream

641
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:23,049
integration of this whole stuff into

642
00:41:16,829 --> 00:41:26,079
releases in SSD we have support of

643
00:41:23,049 --> 00:41:31,839
multi-factor authorization but we

644
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:37,450
couldn't use Oh big whether we think

645
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:39,849
gets two prompts like I need your

646
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:43,359
password and that I need your token or

647
00:41:39,849 --> 00:41:45,190
just one prompt I need a password plus

648
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:49,450
token in one line there are different

649
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:53,109
products open VM to give you one example

650
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:55,299
it doesn't support multiple prompts you

651
00:41:53,109 --> 00:41:59,529
only want to have one prompts and

652
00:41:55,299 --> 00:42:06,339
everything in one line so token system

653
00:41:59,529 --> 00:42:09,309
is not very good with it so now we

654
00:42:06,339 --> 00:42:13,799
already had all the upstream wipe done

655
00:42:09,309 --> 00:42:16,630
but to tune it's dependent on server and

656
00:42:13,799 --> 00:42:20,349
so administrator can can actually

657
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:26,349
manually tune it in cumbrous we have

658
00:42:20,349 --> 00:42:32,500
been supporting speak speak is a

659
00:42:26,349 --> 00:42:38,109
cryptographic mechanism that allows to

660
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:42,250
resolve certain issues in Kerberos

661
00:42:38,109 --> 00:42:47,710
protocol related to getting Kerberos

662
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:51,760
tickets in one request to server 1 :

663
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:55,990
server without disclosing the identity

664
00:42:51,760 --> 00:43:00,970
and without disclosing additional tokens

665
00:42:55,990 --> 00:43:03,939
I have a one factor manufactures fake I

666
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:07,509
would be there in the next version arrow

667
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:10,029
8 but one everything is already

668
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:13,890
integrated in upstream and multi-factor

669
00:43:10,029 --> 00:43:17,820
spike is right now going through the

670
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:22,350
specification approval stage

671
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:26,200
and we are still writing RFC authority

672
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:28,360
now in case it's been ten years that we

673
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:31,299
started working on this multi-factor

674
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:36,570
spike because multi-factor spike is

675
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:45,220
something that would allow us to have a

676
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:50,460
supportive UTF which in turn would

677
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:55,839
strengthen this Cabras factor right and

678
00:43:50,460 --> 00:44:03,820
we also work on two supports hardware

679
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:06,970
cryptographic systems in IDM and the

680
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:10,870
more complicated issues of integration

681
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:13,029
in the directory this is it and now I'll

682
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:16,560
be happy to take your questions thank

683
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:16,560
you thank you

684
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:35,390
good day thank you for your presentation

685
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:40,890
are you planning to do something about

686
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:45,810
planned like they are accessible to

687
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:47,819
anonymous user in the network are you

688
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:53,310
going to do anything out of the box to

689
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:59,940
prevent it from happening in role 7 well

690
00:44:53,310 --> 00:45:03,120
i DM 318 90s by default wouldn't give

691
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:08,450
away date when addressed by anonymous

692
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:11,120
user apart from DSC when the user

693
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:14,669
addresses it to understand the

694
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:21,240
capabilities of this server why

695
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:21,960
specification DSC address has to stay

696
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:30,779
anonymous

697
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:35,070
but if you want to address anything like

698
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:37,890
this e equals example across test then

699
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:41,010
any address it would ask for

700
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:47,029
identification this is already done in

701
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:51,510
upstream free IPA we included

702
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:56,010
prohibition for anonymous address even

703
00:45:51,510 --> 00:46:00,750
to DC and then it turns out that the

704
00:45:56,010 --> 00:46:06,690
software stops operating so we rolled

705
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:10,220
back and we're now thinking of how to

706
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:12,840
rewrite the lady known applications

707
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:14,279
before actually having it but but yeah

708
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:16,730
we're working in this direction thank

709
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,730
you for this question

710
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:28,500
thank you for your presentation my

711
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:34,500
question is this probably there is an

712
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:36,510
article or something as to what are the

713
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:39,680
things that administer should check to

714
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:41,550
go from rl78

715
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:44,549
anything that's going to change this

716
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:46,560
onus pasteurization stuff well first off

717
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:48,800
we have several documents devoted to

718
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:55,799
this particular point release notes

719
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:59,820
surprising it is but miss them I looked

720
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:07,050
at release notes for l8 100 pages good

721
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:11,640
reading a solid book secondly we have

722
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:18,090
documents on going from RAL 7th to

723
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:21,480
around a 2 we have lived up that is

724
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:23,580
there to automate this whole process it

725
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:27,030
identified this configuration than the

726
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:28,470
route 7 and they each other I need to we

727
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:32,430
need to rewrite it and this way this is

728
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:38,580
how I rewrote it look at it and they

729
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:41,339
that this leap allows to go for certain

730
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:45,120
configurations from around 7 to 8 but

731
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:46,910
not for some of them in some cases you

732
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:50,700
have to necessarily go through

733
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:54,270
replication it goes up to rl8 it is

734
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:58,620
included in the replication topology the

735
00:47:54,270 --> 00:48:02,400
data migrate and then the old server is

736
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:07,170
off another important point that you

737
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:08,930
need to check is OpenScape project opens

738
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:11,330
cap contains

739
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:19,640
description

740
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:22,850
of the secure settings that you want to

741
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:26,120
have when you deploy the system and this

742
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:30,440
or that infrastructure SCAP is supported

743
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:33,830
and needed when you deploy in the

744
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:37,390
Ministry of Defense in the US but these

745
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:40,190
same policies are open-source policies

746
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:43,160
so you don't want to have this you don't

747
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:46,040
want to have that you don't want to open

748
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:48,770
too much right to this config files or

749
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:53,810
you don't want to have write rights

750
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:56,870
other than these groups they are all in

751
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:59,230
distributive you can front them get a

752
00:48:56,870 --> 00:49:03,470
report that would be generated

753
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:07,300
automatically and use it apart from the

754
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:07,299
report it actually generates the script

755
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:13,610
well I don't I'm not a big fan of a

756
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:15,980
blind execution of scripts you want to

757
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:19,150
read it but I think this would be the

758
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:25,660
best and fastest way to bring the system

759
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:28,670
to the desired security level but anyway

760
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:30,790
I'll leave up is the main mechanism to

761
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:35,810
run system from one level to another

762
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:39,009
from lower to the higher level thank you

763
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:42,740
for this presentation do you plan to

764
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:45,560
integrate it assists service and do you

765
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:52,040
think it's needed no we don't plan to do

766
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:57,500
that integration of information on

767
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:59,450
network topology for DHCP is something

768
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:04,820
that we have collected we have a project

769
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:07,850
or research upstream of free IP if you

770
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:10,340
visit the APA dot org you would find it

771
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:14,270
in the course of this research we found

772
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:19,180
out several things first off turns out

773
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:19,180
you need to understand that

774
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:30,200
HTTP integration touches upon other

775
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:36,510
subsystems that necessarily need to have

776
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:40,770
credentials identification and you would

777
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:43,140
need to rewrite certain projects to

778
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:50,840
support what IDM is based on like

779
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:53,850
Klara's I mean in three or four years

780
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:56,850
they've been added and now what's left

781
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:59,370
is to develop a mechanism how to present

782
00:50:56,850 --> 00:51:07,370
the scheme to be used by this disappear

783
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:10,109
C server in storage in LDAP the scheme

784
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:13,350
that is there in the traditional recipe

785
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:15,680
Sarah to store in LDAP does not take

786
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:19,350
into consideration their peculiarities

787
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:21,390
it's just a reflection one more

788
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:23,700
reflection of how it's written in the

789
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:27,000
files which does not automatically mean

790
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:27,960
it's right and it would develop

791
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,520
correctly

792
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:36,240
so whenever touched upon this topic and

793
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:41,040
it turned out nobody wants it surprising

794
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:46,500
is it missing and I don't think it's

795
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:49,920
going to be too much of use to those who

796
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:53,970
use public clouds and providers such as

797
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:56,420
Amazon and the like they are not device

798
00:51:53,970 --> 00:52:07,910
are the ones in charge of this

799
00:51:56,420 --> 00:52:07,910
infrastructure DHCP configuration so

800
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:13,380
duplicating this information is not

801
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:15,830
going to make sure that it is going to

802
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,830
be stored

803
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:32,650
a way a face-to would have yet another

804
00:52:28,059 --> 00:52:36,009
problem ts9 server scheme is not just

805
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:40,420
like Microsoft it would normally have

806
00:52:36,009 --> 00:52:46,509
some settings that are specified to be

807
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:49,150
tuned to work with the Microsoft

808
00:52:46,509 --> 00:52:51,160
solutions but when we're trying to do

809
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:56,349
some settings it would not open from the

810
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:59,319
box we don't have these attributes in

811
00:52:56,349 --> 00:53:01,979
the nine solution and we found two

812
00:52:59,319 --> 00:53:03,880
solutions first of all to add it there

813
00:53:01,979 --> 00:53:07,450
manually and then there is another

814
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:11,970
transformation solution which would help

815
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:16,779
us rewrite the requests how are you

816
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:18,519
looking into the ts9 I talking about the

817
00:53:16,779 --> 00:53:22,440
transformation of these requests are

818
00:53:18,519 --> 00:53:22,439
going to be done in some different way

819
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:27,999
there are two answers to your question

820
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:31,569
the first one is I'm going to give you

821
00:53:27,999 --> 00:53:36,038
an advice a piece of advice to start the

822
00:53:31,569 --> 00:53:39,038
VMware customer cases and ask for their

823
00:53:36,039 --> 00:53:41,739
support there so that they can actually

824
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:44,650
see that the users would like to have

825
00:53:41,739 --> 00:53:47,799
such an option because some seems like

826
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:49,660
that there are no other way there is no

827
00:53:47,799 --> 00:53:52,329
other way to do it and the second thing

828
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:54,729
we would experiment with that having

829
00:53:52,329 --> 00:54:00,880
three or four options of this problem

830
00:53:54,729 --> 00:54:07,859
this particular problem resolution 3 8

831
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:11,559
10 DEA's performance would have and even

832
00:54:07,859 --> 00:54:13,269
reduce by four times when we have to do

833
00:54:11,559 --> 00:54:18,059
quite a lot of things and introduced

834
00:54:13,269 --> 00:54:21,700
lots and lots of changes now to actually

835
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:25,180
see this scheme so for this would have

836
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:27,759
to take we would have to create pressure

837
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:32,769
would have to push them would have to

838
00:54:27,759 --> 00:54:36,210
push them and I guess VMware is just the

839
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:36,209
solution here thank you

842
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:56,259
so one final question about that

843
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:58,360
dinosaur with the Hat the Hat has never

844
00:54:56,260 --> 00:55:01,210
had a dinosaur there was a shadow man

845
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:03,880
and it's called Shadow Man not the

846
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:07,510
dinosaur the Shadow Man is still here

847
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:11,890
let me show it to you here but seriously

848
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:17,070
speaking on May the first Red Hat had

849
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:21,100
launched the update of its visual image

850
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:24,100
and this hat is currently our logo

851
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:27,490
you'd be surprised but the there have

852
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:29,410
been six or seven for the course of 25

853
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:32,500
years over the course of 25 years so the

854
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:35,259
Shadow Man was not the first it just

855
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:40,270
stayed there longer and we like it and

856
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:42,640
we love it and we are the shadow men on

857
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:45,160
this particular ride I have not taken

858
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:46,720
this hat with me because it's too hot

859
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:58,210
with it thank you very much for all your

860
00:55:46,720 --> 00:56:01,540
questions to the person as suggested by

861
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:05,740
Vlad as suggested by Vlad in my opinion

862
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:08,830
I should select a person who I should

863
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:11,529
give this candy to the person who would

864
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:13,660
ask the most interesting question about

865
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:17,550
the updates and migration and thank you

866
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:17,549
very much again thanks
