1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,150
nobody could a colleague for the central

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,950
Mel my name is Vladimir Ivanoff I

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:12,830
represent digital security here and

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:17,940
today my presentation it's dedicated to

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:22,198
Apple and MIT first of all I'm going to

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:24,930
discuss with you DHCP protocol dynamic

7
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:30,779
host configuration protocol this is the

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:33,410
way it looks at client sense D recipe

9
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:36,719
discover requests into the network

10
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:40,739
disappea server says this discovered

11
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:43,140
request and depending on the

12
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:46,110
implementation again it can either use

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:50,489
same broadband or use the unicast

14
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:53,460
address of this device and the disappea

15
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:56,099
offer and then the server would offer

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,789
the IP address that the clients might

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:03,000
take then subsequently the client would

18
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:07,229
say what sends disappea request using

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,530
brought broadband or unicast to this

20
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:15,270
server that responded to him with an

21
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:18,240
offer and then gets the IP that was

22
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:22,320
given to him in the offer when the

23
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:25,408
server accepts the request it would

24
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,419
return the recipe ACK all these four

25
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:30,380
steps happened on the stage of

26
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,820
initialization when the client would

27
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:36,420
enter the network for the very first

28
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:39,539
time when he would reconnect to the

29
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,579
network hose connected second time then

30
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,759
you don't need the fastest steps because

31
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,710
the client already knows the IP that he

32
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:51,240
was given and since they're superior

33
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:54,419
requests using the IP address in the 50s

34
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,820
option that was given to him earlier

35
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:00,960
if this IP address is not taken then the

36
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:04,169
server responses a response was disobey

37
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,759
ACK and verifies they addressed the IP

38
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:10,080
address taken by

39
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:12,780
and then the bus by default DNS server

40
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,980
and other options are given to the

41
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:21,200
clients to operate in the network this

42
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:24,480
is how their CPA request looks like

43
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:31,260
there's a PI message type request 50s

44
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:33,390
option requested IP 192.168.1.2 so this

45
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,940
is the requested a pea trance the one

46
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:40,890
requested by the client there's a PR is

47
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:45,870
the response message type rck and then

48
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:53,010
in the third option in the router the

49
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:54,230
router address is 192.168.1.1 and then

50
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:58,320
[Music]

51
00:02:54,230 --> 00:03:01,500
the domain name server IP address is

52
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:06,390
given after half a second you get a

53
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:13,440
second disappea ACK but there you have

54
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:16,070
same transaction ID in act they verify

55
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:21,260
the same ip address requested by the

56
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:26,880
client but rota and DNS server is now

57
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:31,799
192 168 1 point 3 and the question is

58
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:34,109
who is going to be the router right so

59
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:38,840
what would be you answer why the second

60
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:38,840
one the one three not one one

61
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:47,260
looks like this is an apple guy exactly

62
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:51,939
yes the second one the second act

63
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:57,370
rewrites the network settings and the

64
00:03:51,939 --> 00:04:02,140
new rotor is 192 168 1 3 and Dena's also

65
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:06,280
192 168 1 3 but the normal system would

66
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:11,559
take the first ever see act and the

67
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:15,430
second one would be just ignored so how

68
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:17,410
do you use it in practice you need to

69
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,930
disconnect the client in such a way that

70
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,940
he would reconnect but just by just

71
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:24,550
sending the request and which is sent

72
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,590
him back back so how how do we apply

73
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:31,360
that

74
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:36,280
what would the ideas yes this can be

75
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:39,400
done in Wi-Fi with sandy'll packages to

76
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,979
the client declines disconnects and then

77
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,138
reconnects and sense just the request

78
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:46,000
and we can see the request because it's

79
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:49,510
a broadband thing and we can respond to

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,669
it well wait for half a second while the

81
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:57,639
true the recipe server responds and then

82
00:04:51,669 --> 00:05:00,789
we just respond singing the last therapy

83
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:03,849
ACK rewrites the network settings from

84
00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:06,400
the first recipient and it stabili works

85
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:09,280
there so what do you think product

86
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,870
security Apple responded the way they

87
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,359
responded to it they said now it's not a

88
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:17,340
bug it's a feature it's not a bug it's a

89
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,340
fiction right

90
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:24,020
you need to de-identify the Apple device

91
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:28,740
from the network or wait for their

92
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:35,460
request answer was the second and become

93
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:38,640
a boss and Dena's server when the device

94
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:42,120
gets an IP address it has to check

95
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:44,960
whether it's taken that's one

96
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:52,920
they sent a broadband of requests and

97
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:55,830
asks is 192 168 1 2 taken or not if the

98
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:59,030
network already has a device with IP

99
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:03,440
address like that it responds and says

100
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:08,700
that I already have 192 168 I want to

101
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:10,980
then you need to get the recipe decline

102
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:14,490
and get the AP address all over again

103
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:20,430
and then there was a decline you have to

104
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:25,440
name the address you reject 192 168 1 2

105
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:30,450
what happens to you think if this up-up

106
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:37,260
response is sent without the additional

107
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:42,750
request the comment is out of my come

108
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:45,930
for Chinle yes the device works for

109
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:47,880
several hours and the sent five upper

110
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:54,120
responses that we have this IP address

111
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:58,219
and macaws and I ask just gets it what

112
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,220
if you send an ARP request

113
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:05,600
was sender IP same as in iOS and Mac

114
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:16,219
Nazi art response but as a request we

115
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:19,820
send it to a multicast address the app

116
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:28,650
requests and they say that sender IP is

117
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:31,650
192.168.0.1 device things looks like he

118
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:35,400
has same IP because he listens to a

119
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:37,580
multicast address and and he goes do you

120
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:41,099
have this address and you don't have to

121
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:43,380
answer even you just keep sending up

122
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,870
requests and the device automatically

123
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,940
goes off the network in order to

124
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:51,800
disconnect an Apple device from the

125
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:55,410
network it is enough to have five

126
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,360
broadcasting up requests not up

127
00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:02,190
responses up requests and it works

128
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:04,530
simply both in fixed networks in my face

129
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:09,990
so what do you think the response was no

130
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:12,719
it's not the back after there's a

131
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:18,540
decline when the client gets that dress

132
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:23,370
he requests is it taken or not if it is

133
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:25,980
taken then you send the decline do you

134
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:28,160
understand what the problem is how about

135
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,160
this

136
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:42,510
the next transaction ID is an increment

137
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:45,930
of the previous transaction ID so what

138
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:49,890
do you think Apple responded to that yes

139
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:53,670
you're right it's not a bug this is a

140
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:57,900
demo on how this can be used in a

141
00:08:53,670 --> 00:09:05,849
man-in-the-middle attack we have the

142
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:09,480
address 192 168 1 2 rotor one one DNS 1

143
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:23,880
1 8 in current Linux the IP address is

144
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:30,360
192 168 1 3 and here you're going to see

145
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:33,170
the new IP address 192 168 1 23 we pick

146
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:37,560
the interface we start the Apache and

147
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:40,560
DNS server now I'm going to amplify on

148
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:45,650
that later later on we scan the network

149
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,650
we find 2 apple devices

150
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:56,250
we pick the first target of our attack

151
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:03,420
we send up requests and there you go

152
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:12,579
decline is sound and the device will

153
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:18,820
have to get the IP address all over

154
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:23,290
again so we've seen the transaction ID

155
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:27,610
of the next connection we interrupt this

156
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:29,589
connection and now since we know the

157
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:32,260
number of the next transaction we can

158
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:34,300
respond before the Apple device requests

159
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:40,480
for anything and I'm going to refer this

160
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:44,199
one later the address of 192 168 123

161
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:56,440
rotate on the Linux DNS server also Kali

162
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:59,590
Linux so what's needed five broadband

163
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:02,080
and or multicast are requests we

164
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:06,760
interrupt the procedure of getting an IP

165
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:09,100
address and then we can respond to the

166
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,830
recipe request before they actually send

167
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:14,980
because we already know the next number

168
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:17,170
of transaction ID and this is the only

169
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,960
thing you need to respond to disappear

170
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:24,099
correctly and we become the DNS server

171
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:27,880
and the bus all these three techniques

172
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:32,860
work only in Mac OS and iOS and Linux

173
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:36,160
and Android in Windows and Linux it

174
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:38,500
doesn't work just in Mac OS and iOS and

175
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,420
that's because product security keeps

176
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:46,240
saying it's not a bug it's a feature and

177
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:50,920
this is what we want and it comes out of

178
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:56,550
RFC I haven't seen anything RFC and now

179
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:56,550
let's discuss ipv6

180
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:08,100
ipv6 is cooler than ipv4 because it has

181
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:11,580
one two 8-bit address while the ipv4 has

182
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:15,959
a 32-bit address ipv4 can get address

183
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:22,470
automatically only using DHCP while IP

184
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:25,500
VX can use slack and dhcpv6 the rv4 has

185
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:28,980
20 byte had an uncertain filter fields

186
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:34,110
and their p v6 has 40 bad hat and an 80

187
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:37,290
felts and also the ipv6 sadness know

188
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:39,329
Chuck's and while ipv4 still has it

189
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:43,260
although it's not needed because you

190
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:48,930
have checked some anyway and local and

191
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:50,450
your dress looks cooler with ipv6 like a

192
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:54,920
stateless address auto-configuration

193
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:57,120
while jewish CPV stateful address

194
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,689
configuration slack works in the

195
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,630
following way

196
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:07,589
a client sends to a multicast address

197
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:12,870
and I wrote a station request rotor can

198
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:15,300
the one who can work with ipv6 since I

199
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:19,290
simply with six wrote an advertisement

200
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:24,270
the package wrote advertisement gives

201
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:29,550
you a profits and the address of DNS

202
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:32,130
server it can also have this we have six

203
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:37,109
steps here first superstar festus top

204
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:39,930
seller from slack then solicits solicits

205
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:43,110
request is sent and advertises the

206
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:45,479
answer and the office say p address the

207
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:49,770
client sends the request and the server

208
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:51,160
gets answers with a reply as easy as

209
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:56,110
simple as that

210
00:13:51,160 --> 00:14:00,490
so how i p v6 are used first most

211
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:02,760
popular way is when ipv6 is not used it

212
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:06,100
doesn't have to do with Yandex obviously

213
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:08,230
when ipv6 is not used it basically means

214
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,660
that the network equipment or network

215
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:11,700
admins don't want ipv6 you don't know

216
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:15,550
what to do with it

217
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:19,050
second case is when you use slack only

218
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:25,240
and third case is one-year slack and

219
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:29,979
dhcpv6 one ipv6 is not used the attacker

220
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:33,070
I can build his own ipv6 network with

221
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:36,820
higher priority a dinner service and

222
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:42,490
busses so how the settings look like

223
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:51,010
double stack IP v4 and v6 the roads for

224
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:56,560
v6 s 1 1 & 4 v6 it answer with a 8 da in

225
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:59,800
DNS service ipv6 DNS service less are of

226
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,510
lesser priority lower priority the

227
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,160
judging by the settings but if we have a

228
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:09,460
look at the traffic we see that they

229
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:14,230
clients first sense the DNS for ipv6 DNS

230
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:17,230
seventh only then for the ipv4 one and

231
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:19,510
that's because ipv6 DNS server has

232
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:24,210
higher priority although it's not the

233
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:28,720
case in the settings priorities 8

234
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:31,350
prioritization of ipv6 over ipv4 looks

235
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:35,970
this way and this happens in many

236
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:39,610
systems not just Mac OS and iOS

237
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:42,160
another bad news from iOS you cannot

238
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:44,190
switch off ipv6 it works there by

239
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,770
default all the times and if there is an

240
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:52,270
evildoer in the network all he needs is

241
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:55,150
up the slack and dish it's a previous

242
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:58,930
sever and start a DNS server on his

243
00:15:55,150 --> 00:16:03,910
address and thus slow down the device if

244
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:07,599
I should be a v6 traffic is not filtered

245
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:10,140
in any way one only slack has yes they

246
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:15,190
all as a sense wrote a solicitation

247
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:18,610
request a Dorota response in a row two

248
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:22,720
advertisement what happens next Mac OS

249
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:25,270
and iOS wants the fool they IP address

250
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,990
in full so the yeast recipe basics in

251
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:33,880
every every second till the end of time

252
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:36,820
they send this request out there's the P

253
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:39,640
requests and whoever responds first to

254
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:44,500
wrote a solicitation to wrote

255
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:51,010
advertisement sorry is becoming the ipv6

256
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:54,730
bus but we now have a look at the inner

257
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:58,960
settings in wrote advertisement we have

258
00:16:54,730 --> 00:17:01,560
DNS server that ends with a 8 di and

259
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:05,590
it's in the variant

260
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:10,750
because in their CP v6 reply the DNS

261
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:13,899
server is for a d0 salmon and if we have

262
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:18,250
a look at the traffic will see that DNS

263
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:22,600
request first fly towards DNS server

264
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:28,900
that comes to the v6 and only done to

265
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:30,310
slack slack and there's a v6 the

266
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:34,150
prioritization looks the following way

267
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:37,659
if there is a dear CPV 67 and slack in

268
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:40,300
the network ants they give different DNS

269
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:43,150
service then Mac OS would first go to

270
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:45,580
the recipe v6 and only Santa slack

271
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:47,830
that's the pressurization so all you

272
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:51,399
need as an attacker is to launch their

273
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:54,730
superior 6 server start the DNS on its

274
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:59,500
address and resolve their dresses the

275
00:17:54,730 --> 00:18:04,750
way in once and generally speaking DNS

276
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:07,360
server prioritization looks like this

277
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:10,830
there's appear of a sixth and slack and

278
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,830
only than their sippy

279
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:22,320
such case when network admins know how

280
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:28,560
to work was ipv6 they have both slack

281
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:28,980
and ipv6 then that technology is a few

282
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:33,080
sauce

283
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:35,790
we have their superior v6 reply the

284
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:40,879
address the IP address is given that

285
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:40,879
ends was 86 e what happens next

286
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:49,260
according to duplicate address address

287
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:52,140
detection you need to verify whether or

288
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:54,830
not to say P address is taken in order

289
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:58,590
to do that you use neighbor solicitation

290
00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:04,080
requests from Andy P protocol neighbor

291
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:05,699
discovery protocol if a host was same IP

292
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,449
address is already there then

293
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:13,250
neighborhood participant gets to him and

294
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:16,080
they will tell him that address is taken

295
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:19,920
this is the way it looks in practice the

296
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:24,110
client would get an IP address and we

297
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:26,820
see it she signs neighbor solicitation

298
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:28,530
request we see this neighbor

299
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,389
solicitation request because it's a

300
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:33,060
multicast and we respond to it and the

301
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:38,490
client says now there's a P basics

302
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:42,480
decline and all you need as an attacker

303
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:46,470
is to respond first to the solicits

304
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,300
request and duplicate data state action

305
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:51,630
is Adamo haunted because you have

306
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:55,620
unlimited number of attempts to respond

307
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:58,050
first and then you just update in a

308
00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:00,649
server and resolve the domains the way

309
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:00,649
you want them

310
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:13,419
one everybody is on to network we do not

311
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:16,509
see the recipe the six requests how we

312
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:19,929
find the device that knows how to deal

313
00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:24,789
with ipv6 this huge addresses how would

314
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:28,120
you scan the network at this scale your

315
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:33,340
scan it was just one single request it

316
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:39,070
just send a multicast thing and all

317
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:42,639
devices who can handle ipv6 answer think

318
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:46,090
reply so we can just use one request to

319
00:20:42,639 --> 00:20:50,289
scan all all the whole network you don't

320
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:56,439
have to send 124 ARP requests

321
00:20:50,289 --> 00:21:01,809
that's why ipv6 is cooler this crypto is

322
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:11,230
capable of scanning looks this way this

323
00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:13,450
is the output in ipv6 they don't have

324
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:18,070
our protocol they have a neighbor

325
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:20,440
discovery protocol RDP protocol one you

326
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:24,549
know ipv6 address and you want to know

327
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:30,159
their MAC address of the same device in

328
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:33,549
this figure you can see rota 8d eh-eh-eh

329
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:36,340
da and you can ask for the table that

330
00:21:33,549 --> 00:21:39,250
you see below and it contains the

331
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:42,250
correlations between ipv6 address and

332
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:43,750
MAC address and how many minutes the

333
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:49,980
seconds are left before the next

334
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:53,799
notification like 22 seconds here and

335
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:58,049
just like was ARP spoofing we sent

336
00:21:53,799 --> 00:22:01,750
neighbor advertisement packages every

337
00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:07,110
second every two seconds and we sent

338
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:11,760
source of address a 8d a while

339
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:17,070
I mean crc while we put our own IP and

340
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:23,879
in l2 level will also send out from our

341
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:32,399
own Mac let's look at the NDP cash table

342
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:36,390
once again earlier we had a 8 da and now

343
00:22:32,399 --> 00:22:41,010
the MAC address rotor is changed and now

344
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:44,760
we're in control of AP v6 traffic so

345
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:48,330
what we need is to send neighbor

346
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:51,600
advertisement packages with wrote

347
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:54,629
address or DNS address from our own Mac

348
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:58,439
and then resolve the domains the way we

349
00:22:54,630 --> 00:23:00,630
want what is another way of poisoning

350
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:04,399
and the peak hash table without using

351
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:08,610
this and the P cache and the packages

352
00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:12,330
you can send out wrote advancement

353
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:18,178
packages again from ipv6 address or DNS

354
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:21,570
server from your own Mac so you send out

355
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:25,139
those packages and the Antipa cache

356
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:26,809
table is poisoned and once again we are

357
00:23:25,139 --> 00:23:30,479
in full control

358
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:36,730
we are post the bus and the dns server

359
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:38,710
for the ipv6 network so

360
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:40,990
what but they're the only thing we need

361
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:44,980
it to send out wrote advertisement

362
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:48,670
packages from the IP address of 300 a

363
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:51,160
DNS server from our own Mac that's that

364
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:56,920
gives us the opportunity to resolve the

365
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:59,140
hosta moment what to do after the

366
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,390
meeting if you see man-in-the-middle

367
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:06,780
attack you see the traffic but it's

368
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:08,500
ciphered and what we need is login

369
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:12,460
password or something

370
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:16,390
but until iya TTLs so what we're gonna

371
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:19,540
do we're gonna fish fishing is the

372
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:23,860
answer and os is there to help us do the

373
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:25,389
fishing right after the OS joins the

374
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:27,969
network or reconnect to the network

375
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:32,350
something changes in networking networks

376
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:39,490
at sessions it sends get requests on the

377
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:42,250
captive apple.com and if you get 200

378
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:45,760
status code and you get such as in the

379
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:47,890
body then the Apple device understands

380
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,530
all is called Internet is there but

381
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:52,630
since we did they run in the middle

382
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:56,530
attack we can resolve this domain and we

383
00:24:52,630 --> 00:25:02,410
can respond with our own IP address up

384
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:05,020
the Apache and send him this 3:02 status

385
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:06,400
code and redirect to the domain and our

386
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:13,300
under our control

387
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:15,790
like iOS Apple why.com it's just random

388
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:18,159
dress then OS goes to this year-round

389
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:23,190
and whatever we want to do there any

390
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:29,070
content that we wants to go through it

391
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:32,230
including Apple ID would be reflected on

392
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:35,950
top of all the windows

393
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:42,100
and if you close it then it would reopen

394
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:43,990
itself once again and if you push cancel

395
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:48,039
you'll have you'll no longer have

396
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:53,200
internet so you have to enter Apple ID

397
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:55,570
and password this is a CSS but it looks

398
00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:00,399
like an ATM window yeah it's just

399
00:25:55,570 --> 00:26:03,399
man-made or Google identification for

400
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:06,699
that matter you can put there whatever

401
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:09,428
you want and the best thing is that this

402
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:13,330
smallish browser that knows nothing

403
00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:14,799
it opens on top of every windows and if

404
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:22,809
you close it you don't have internet

405
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:27,850
connection if you push the X button you

406
00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:34,779
it opens itself again and in I also s

407
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:37,959
and in Mac OS it looks this way well

408
00:26:34,779 --> 00:26:41,769
like Apple ID you can use it and the

409
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:46,360
moment the user enters the credential

410
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:48,309
the script would find and give you these

411
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:51,100
other credential from credentials of

412
00:26:48,309 --> 00:26:54,760
this IP address and then you use the

413
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:57,850
technique with forecasting the next

414
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:02,260
transaction idea that I mentioned above

415
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:05,320
we see that captive Apple come the men

416
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:10,000
was requested and we respond with code

417
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:14,019
302 and it goes to a OS Apple or Wi-Fi

418
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,600
calm and then you either enter your

419
00:27:14,019 --> 00:27:18,340
credential or credentials as a user or

420
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,899
you don't have internet connection so

421
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:25,918
you basically don't have a choice as a

422
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:30,559
user in Mac OS we haven't been v2 but

423
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:38,649
you know the finders have the SMB shares

424
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:44,658
if we successfully performed our MIT M

425
00:27:38,649 --> 00:27:48,590
attack you can inject this code and then

426
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:56,149
with SMB / / and if the browser if this

427
00:27:48,590 --> 00:28:01,249
is safari sees this kind of link it goes

428
00:27:56,149 --> 00:28:03,229
do you want to open finder do you want

429
00:28:01,249 --> 00:28:08,799
to allow this page to open finder and

430
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:12,669
the user says okay allow and the spider

431
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:16,820
actually it's capable of inputting the

432
00:28:12,669 --> 00:28:19,100
credential if you forget to uncheck this

433
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:22,730
is the correspondent box you give and

434
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:26,959
then the chrome says do you want to open

435
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:31,789
this link in finder yeah okay

436
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:37,429
Firefox is the same respondus says here

437
00:28:31,789 --> 00:28:42,049
here are the credentials served the

438
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:45,340
Finder is capable of using not just the

439
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:49,009
domain names but also the IP address and

440
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:55,369
store it in keychains using them and

441
00:28:49,009 --> 00:28:58,669
this is the link 192 168 1 0 1 so what

442
00:28:55,369 --> 00:29:01,509
finder would do why it goes why do you

443
00:28:58,669 --> 00:29:01,509
think finder would go

444
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,860
yes I'm telling that

445
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:14,439
so you think that the finder would go to

446
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,330
this IP address and try to connect it

447
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:19,180
but the finally doesn't want to connect

448
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:21,870
using the IP address he wants to send

449
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:28,060
you broadcast not pious request and

450
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:34,659
wants to know so I have the name 192 168

451
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:37,870
0 1 I want to know someone what's the IP

452
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:44,890
address corresponds to this name and

453
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:51,820
responder says a 192 168 0 1 highest IP

454
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:55,540
address 192 168 0 107 and you have

455
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:58,240
everything including the hashes and this

456
00:29:55,540 --> 00:30:01,120
is the only bug that Apple actually

457
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,220
believed is a bag and they did something

458
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,110
about it

459
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:07,360
and this happens because they find it

460
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:09,100
doesn't understand one year connect

461
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,250
using IP address it doesn't understand

462
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:15,010
if it's an IP address or name he thinks

463
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:19,480
it's a name and he tries to find it

464
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:23,320
using that BS and they have the security

465
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:27,520
update they actually mentioned me in

466
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:30,270
Security Advisor and that would be all

467
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:34,800
the scripts that I have shown you is

468
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:34,800
github so you can get them there

469
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:54,409
do we have any questions thank you for

470
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:56,059
your presentation could you please tell

471
00:30:54,410 --> 00:31:00,200
me the option for the normal run of

472
00:30:56,059 --> 00:31:02,510
things in a normal laptop or for the

473
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,980
mobile device do they split them yes

474
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:07,340
they split them and did they do it

475
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:11,020
separately so you just naturally check

476
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:13,730
and verify for the heaters if it's a

477
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:18,830
desktop you provided with a big version

478
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:22,370
yeah and if it's a safari version I send

479
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:26,000
it a link SMB / slash and Safari it's

480
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:28,790
trying to open it in the finder and puts

481
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,490
there hashes there we can actually start

482
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:34,990
a video again and double-check it it

483
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:40,510
looks like a native window actually

484
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:40,510
stole it and slightly modified

485
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:50,680
so it's a bit of a ripoff and you can do

486
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:54,540
it like you said as well just hold on a

487
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:54,540
second let me remember

488
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:02,860
it's not about the router it's about the

489
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:04,929
switch basically which tells which ports

490
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:08,770
would be dedicated for these CP

491
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:12,520
responses if you Center DHCP response

492
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:15,370
from a fake a port it would not just let

493
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:17,590
into the network and with the ipv6 there

494
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:20,070
are techniques and methods there but

495
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:23,080
naturally everyone forgets about ipv6

496
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:25,659
everyone is disinterested about it but

497
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:30,460
iOS is much more interested about the

498
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:34,780
use of the ipv6 rather than ipv4 do you

499
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:38,140
have any other questions hi there

500
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:41,590
thanks a lot for your lecture maybe I

501
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:45,820
sound stupid but what are we going to do

502
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:48,280
about it with the Apple with the apples

503
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:50,260
Bob bug but Apple reports but it's not a

504
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:54,310
bug and there is nothing we can do about

505
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:59,290
it but is there something that we can do

506
00:32:54,310 --> 00:33:01,889
about it on our own oh I am afraid No

507
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:04,600
you can protect at the network level

508
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:07,840
using networking devices a hardware

509
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:13,179
protection for example if you take an

510
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:16,659
apple router can you just to cancel the

511
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:21,220
ipv6 traffic yes we can cancel ipv6

512
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:24,430
traffic altogether so with this case in

513
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:26,350
the network where ipv6 is not present it

514
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:30,370
would not just penetrate there exactly

515
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:34,149
and about the fishing we can send the

516
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:38,050
login and the password there just to

517
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:40,000
verify these credentials yes good

518
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:44,379
question and I'll give you a t-shirt for

519
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:48,070
that exactly exactly and I would I want

520
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:51,770
to also wanted to add the verification

521
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:55,820
the two-stage verification but

522
00:33:51,770 --> 00:34:00,620
didn't do that but active comm with the

523
00:33:55,820 --> 00:34:03,679
DNS requests intercepted we can send it

524
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:09,350
to our localhost alternatively yes we

525
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:11,450
can do it but it may think about the the

526
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:14,600
there is Internet connectivity with the

527
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:17,960
200 option with it 3 or 2 there would be

528
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:19,940
a pop-up window on the screen I can play

529
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:25,460
a video we still have time and we'll

530
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:27,230
repeat it to you by showing that so it's

531
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:34,460
basically not the content it's about the

532
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:36,770
status that it perceives like that yes

533
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:39,159
and I will show you just hold on a

534
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:39,159
second

535
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:53,009
ah can I reverse it a little bit I don't

536
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:57,320
know how to rewind it can I rewind my

537
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:57,320
video to play it back again

538
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:09,000
I still have 25 minutes so we have

539
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:11,910
plenty of time to rewind it anyway the

540
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:16,470
status code 200 would be a wrong thing

541
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:18,990
the 302 code is the right thing and we

542
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:22,140
can reroute it because we would be

543
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:25,589
resolving this domain elsewhere where we

544
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:33,299
are we reroute in it and I don't know

545
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:36,470
about 500 this browser supports gs

546
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,470
supports SS

547
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:48,160
yeah well it's it's not an all rounder

548
00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:57,789
but it's capable of doing at least

549
00:35:48,160 --> 00:36:05,710
something with the dhcp options there is

550
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:07,960
a proxy setting so you can get there and

551
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:11,440
you can only get the proxy there if

552
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:16,630
there is a a tick there if there is no

553
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:20,140
tick it wouldn't start have you ever

554
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:24,190
tried 301 I have to write 302 like I

555
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:25,960
said so that's the pop-up window I

556
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:37,680
promised to show you take a look at the

557
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:37,680
screen do you have any other questions

558
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:46,180
thank you for your lecture what would be

559
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:52,480
the conditions it should be an Apple

560
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:56,649
device like we understand how do we

561
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:58,660
establish a network connection the

562
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:04,510
attack is only possible through the

563
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:07,029
Wi-Fi connectivity yes so without Wi-Fi

564
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:09,700
there would be no such a thing

565
00:37:07,029 --> 00:37:12,339
say again but if you are connected

566
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:16,450
through the local network not using

567
00:37:12,339 --> 00:37:19,509
Wi-Fi how can we perform an attack by

568
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:21,368
using method number one we wait until

569
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:24,010
the device is disconnected from the

570
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:27,700
network next morning it would reach the

571
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:29,950
connection we see it and we attack it

572
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:34,240
because we will see a request on the

573
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:36,730
network you will be able to like listen

574
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:42,459
through the multicast would be able to

575
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:44,220
see this device pop up on the record but

576
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:47,920
you know by default it's always

577
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:51,259
connected physically to the local

578
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:56,830
network and the cable is always in

579
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:56,830
and here we can use option number three

580
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:04,820
option number three is just a

581
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:07,280
forecasting for sharing the next trusted

582
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:09,170
ID and what's the probability of

583
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,140
guessing one hundred percent probability

584
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:15,290
we interrupt this procedure when we know

585
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:19,629
the next transaction ID and there is one

586
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:19,630
hundred percent chance that we do that

587
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:30,770
if we belong to different networks it

588
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:33,890
wouldn't work but I assume that there is

589
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:36,350
a way of doing it without establishing

590
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:38,810
the Wi-Fi connection the main condition

591
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:40,970
that we must belong to the same network

592
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:50,570
and we'd be able to listen to the

593
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:51,589
multicast on condition that we can

594
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:55,310
connect it to the network

595
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:59,090
yes exactly but if we don't have any

596
00:38:55,310 --> 00:39:02,270
access to Wi-Fi or local network we

597
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:11,420
cannot attack no we can't thank you

598
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:14,690
noted your question please the captive

599
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:19,010
portal requests by an apple device must

600
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:24,280
be using a certificate pending and is

601
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:29,540
checking for cert what if we just put

602
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:35,619
into into some legitimate URL it would

603
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:39,170
be just digesting it no not exactly

604
00:39:35,619 --> 00:39:42,680
because it would be addressing HTTP

605
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:45,230
slash slash and there is no pending but

606
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:49,359
what if we redirect it to another

607
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:53,480
resource to another URL would that be a

608
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:55,970
safari like browser or truncated one

609
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:57,590
it's a truncated one but SS is

610
00:39:55,970 --> 00:40:00,680
operational there but what about

611
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:02,080
certificates about certificates if there

612
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,930
is pinning in there

613
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:08,529
there is one and I checked and

614
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:13,859
double-checked I did try it with the 302

615
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:19,690
and I did try to test the Google Chrome

616
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:20,350
web site and there is pinning anything

617
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:27,970
else

618
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:32,040
I think this a captive Apple and check

619
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:35,680
Android have been used when when we

620
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:40,390
established the public network yes it's

621
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:42,669
a common feature as far as I remember

622
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:47,410
the active portal can be shut down and

623
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:49,690
it won't be able to bring it up yes if

624
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:52,180
there is just a one tick is removed

625
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:56,670
which signals that it's always on by

626
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:56,669
default then it can do it like you said

627
00:40:56,850 --> 00:41:08,560
so the captive portal must be switched

628
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:11,200
off on an Apple device but what about

629
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:17,740
Android I haven't tried it on Android

630
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:20,230
yet I've only been doing it on Apple on

631
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:23,799
Android seven and eight there there

632
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:28,420
would be a truncated version of Google

633
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:30,220
Chrome with pinning enabled on it we

634
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:33,900
thought it would not be working that it

635
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:33,899
is actually it is working

636
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:44,980
what if all of the devices are Apple

637
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:48,420
devices including this server if these

638
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:52,750
devices belong to the Microsoft

639
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:55,800
environment with a Microsoft server what

640
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:59,140
you've seen on the slides are just

641
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:02,260
pictures it's any server that would be

642
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:04,868
capable of do that instead of slaw with

643
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:07,030
the exception of slack if there is no

644
00:42:04,869 --> 00:42:11,460
proper setting set there would be no

645
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:15,550
wrote router advertisement what if HD

646
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:19,840
TCP server has some security options

647
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:24,000
enabled which one exactly like searching

648
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:27,609
for other DHCP devices on the network

649
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,100
normally this is engaged on the

650
00:42:27,609 --> 00:42:33,190
networking equipment so that none of the

651
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:34,750
other servers but the main one would be

652
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:37,210
able to respond if there is such a

653
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:40,740
security option enabled nothing will

654
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:43,060
work because that's what protects it

655
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:46,479
just just want it to make sure whether

656
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:48,840
it's really so seems like it is any

657
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,840
other questions

658
00:42:51,380 --> 00:43:01,190
I think I have a couple of questions the

659
00:42:56,990 --> 00:43:05,450
first one which operating systems would

660
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:09,920
have to have this update what would be

661
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:12,529
the option for the meter as a cell if

662
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,300
there is SS opening enabled and the

663
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:22,460
application that doesn't work but there

664
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:24,950
are different options aren't there if

665
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:33,950
you'd like to check the traffic used by

666
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:37,720
the application if the it can be done by

667
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:44,000
using some loopholes like sending the

668
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:47,598
cert which is signed

669
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:52,640
but what about the websites if it has

670
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:55,609
HTC s it will not work and if if we feed

671
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:57,920
it to the browser it would give us a

672
00:43:55,609 --> 00:44:00,650
warning I are really certain that you

673
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:03,710
would like to move there if only the

674
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:11,570
user clicks yes I'm certain I'm sure

675
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:13,960
they will be directed there any other

676
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:13,960
questions

677
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:24,890
which patch was that which operating

678
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:27,650
systems I don't really remember Harkins

679
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:30,620
I can double-check it how it was patched

680
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:33,620
and which version was used for that I

681
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:40,970
guess it was done a little earlier this

682
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:43,279
year there are multiple perks that I'm

683
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:45,379
not allowed to talk about by the Apple

684
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,690
guys at this particular conference but

685
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:54,850
there are different other tricks and

686
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:54,850
tools that I will tell you later I guess

687
00:44:57,550 --> 00:45:04,100
like six weeks ago I found yet another

688
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:07,220
bug of which I'm not allowed to speak

689
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:10,250
before it's fixed so we have to wait

690
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:15,980
till it gets fixed then I will tell you

691
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:19,900
the whole real true story but now don't

692
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:19,900
have the permission to thank you

693
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:23,850
thanks for listen
