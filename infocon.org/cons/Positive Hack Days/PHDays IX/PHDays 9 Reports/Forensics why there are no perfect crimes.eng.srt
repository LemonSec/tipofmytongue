1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,370
Dobrynin shisha now let us investigate

2
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:11,280
some incidence my name is Sergey mcaren

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,889
I work with every case I for security

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:18,600
and we do practical in information

5
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:21,029
security I think all the attendees know

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,000
about computer forensics I'll remind you

7
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:30,000
computer forensic was a science that

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:36,000
investigates incidents which in digital

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,969
field according to some data in the web

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:46,140
global market of services in the global

11
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:48,719
Forensic Services is has a volume of

12
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,360
approximately 3.5 billion dollars and

13
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:58,579
the size of cybercrime digital

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:01:07,908
cybercrime is about 1.5 trillion dollars

15
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:10,890
yes indeed great difference and let's

16
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:14,220
just recall in general how we

17
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:17,790
investigate an incident after getting a

18
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:22,110
call we have to check if this incident

19
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:25,560
were or not an incident if it is not you

20
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:28,920
can just go and keep drinking tea if it

21
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:33,360
is an incident we perform a live

22
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:39,380
analysis we research a various memory

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:42,970
Network activity and two other things on

24
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:47,960
on that machine without turning it off

25
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:49,640
once we found data we write reports and

26
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:55,720
keep drinking tea

27
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:56,930
if not we start researching the

28
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,479
completer

29
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:09,440
regardless for courses and what they

30
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:13,430
have and if we have data we write a

31
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:17,870
report and keep drinking tea forensic

32
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:20,620
today is episode availability for

33
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:25,330
everyone

34
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:28,670
programmes for the rating modification

35
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:31,450
information they are numerous in open

36
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:40,089
source you can download install and use

37
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:43,399
criminals get much more ingenious and

38
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:47,930
use all methods to hide their activity

39
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:51,140
and we need to remind ourselves that the

40
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:56,390
market is huge so can the criminals be

41
00:02:51,140 --> 00:03:05,380
found the answers yes the phenomena is

42
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:05,380
quite simple all criminals are stupid

43
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:17,828
irrelevant irrational and inattentive

44
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:24,650
and forensics are supposed to find those

45
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:28,329
errors over lack of intelligence or

46
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:32,350
attention so my presentation is simple

47
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:32,350
several real cases

48
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,799
where

49
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:52,379
all right six head to bypass methods

50
00:03:45,170 --> 00:04:00,060
Trek covering so I tried to make my

51
00:03:52,379 --> 00:04:11,940
presentation short so let us meet our

52
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:20,279
main heroes first is a god is sitting at

53
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:25,199
computer and our next hero is off his

54
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:28,500
people then professional and a school

55
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,539
boy let us imagine we're at the stage

56
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,639
where we have parted the disk and

57
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:36,240
discovered the crypto container or

58
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:40,050
complete disk encryption and then we

59
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:47,300
shall switch to real cases with real

60
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:54,270
people who made this crypto container

61
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:56,970
and were quite careless about their

62
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:59,700
passwords after discovering there is

63
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:03,960
great encryption you should look at the

64
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:06,240
working station of the suspect people

65
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,960
like your guard cannot remember the

66
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,550
passwords and don't use any means of

67
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:15,510
their safe storage that's approximately

68
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:17,190
what data you see thee we have the

69
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:20,849
working and password straight on the

70
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:25,740
table and that's another copy a girl a

71
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:28,550
young lady remembered to buy her painted

72
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:31,009
house and us

73
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:33,110
the right passwords on her monitors did

74
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:35,690
they stick the password if you think

75
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:38,720
that few people keep passwords like that

76
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:41,569
you are wrong there are many cases when

77
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,979
people keep their passwords in this

78
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:48,409
manner so once there are no stickers so

79
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:50,419
horridly passwords just look into all

80
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:54,590
the available places like social

81
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:59,599
networks a young lady from our window

82
00:05:54,590 --> 00:06:01,669
was actually keeping the financial

83
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:04,550
report of an organization in the zip

84
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:10,758
archives we look at her page and

85
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:13,970
discovered she has photos stored in the

86
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,650
community came and she was adding some

87
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:20,889
screenshots to VK

88
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:23,299
to find them at one screenshot of

89
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:29,319
available photos there was a screenshot

90
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:32,719
of her nodes with passwords so certainly

91
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:35,120
one of those passwords was good was the

92
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:39,650
one from the archives that she kept in

93
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:43,400
zip file in in zip archives or another

94
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:48,198
case a working computer and his working

95
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:52,638
station a guy somehow installed a G in

96
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:56,360
GTA San Andreas and on at first was no

97
00:06:52,639 --> 00:07:01,000
passwords but if you go to the file with

98
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:05,840
that stored info you can see txt file

99
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:13,310
where he had all his full data and even

100
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:18,590
as a Mac wrist restorer codes office

101
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:20,539
offices monkey's office certainly went

102
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:22,099
through the security courses in their

103
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:24,680
organizations they know they shouldn't

104
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:27,319
write the passwords down on papers or in

105
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,620
the computer but still they cannot

106
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:34,610
remember all passwords that's why they

107
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:40,699
reuse the same password and there's a

108
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:46,009
wonderful site have I leaned us warned

109
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:52,490
so if it can allow you to see the leaks

110
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:55,279
of a certain email address so what do we

111
00:07:52,490 --> 00:08:01,520
try to find all the emails of a person

112
00:07:55,279 --> 00:08:08,270
all possible contacts then enter into

113
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:13,490
this window and the site will show all

114
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:19,430
the leaks for this account we can take

115
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:23,089
and try to use those passwords to those

116
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:25,789
crypto containers and there was very

117
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:28,520
high probability they will match because

118
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:33,049
people was responsible about encoding

119
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:37,360
encrypting their data a very convenient

120
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:40,848
site for forensic ah for mark forensics

121
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:45,290
which are the most problematic we are

122
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:48,680
looking for all the emails and enter to

123
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:50,620
the website online and discovers a week

124
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:55,050
so Google

125
00:08:50,620 --> 00:09:00,280
these GPS in the weather easy to Google

126
00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:03,099
and try to match if it doesn't match we

127
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:07,150
kind of mute them how do we move how do

128
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:14,440
we merge them we see a passport like us

129
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:19,569
mommy don't 108 3 we imagine that mommy

130
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:22,180
don't is a static part 0 8 7 and we

131
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:26,140
start a research and discover that it's

132
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:30,280
it's a real password that the person it

133
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:35,439
was the first year it should be another

134
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:40,540
static part of the password once we have

135
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:44,440
changed try to vote yes indeed so we

136
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:50,219
discover something similar matching and

137
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:54,210
then imagine we are in and decrypted

138
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:57,820
cryptid container website and the

139
00:09:54,210 --> 00:10:02,380
miscreant tries to delete the proof in

140
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:06,910
case of the of our code you can just go

141
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:09,880
to the bill and find it and then we have

142
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:12,040
software in order to restore data

143
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:15,730
I like our studio because it's

144
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:18,310
convenient it allows you to forward by

145
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:21,940
date and time and extension digital

146
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:23,800
people announcer to do the X symbol

147
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,840
attacks today there's entrance and

148
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:30,800
transport export everything what we have

149
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:33,430
found another case so the big company

150
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:38,449
so this big company has a big project

151
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:41,120
and so then this project was stolen and

152
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:43,430
another the company a large company as

153
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,010
well so this identical project appeared

154
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:48,529
yeah exactly the same so what the people

155
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:50,689
companies big they don't want just to go

156
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:53,510
public with it and they want to do it on

157
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:58,220
the quiet Cerveny just you to narrow

158
00:10:53,510 --> 00:11:02,330
down the list of suspects and so and we

159
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:05,630
identified oh yes access to the analysis

160
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:09,320
standing so and as a suspect so the

161
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:11,240
initial cold access the source code - so

162
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,630
then when they just identify where this

163
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:18,589
information went and so this is

164
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:21,290
disinformation this example so the guy

165
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:25,160
the guy had the brother and the company

166
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:29,240
which got this information and then so

167
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:32,329
then we identified the suspects and so

168
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:34,970
then we try to see their workstations or

169
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:37,310
just restore data if possible if there

170
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:40,930
is nothing there left has been deleted

171
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:46,219
so after we have retry to do that on the

172
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:49,819
the computer out of the brother of the

173
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:51,980
guy who stole the information so we

174
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:55,310
found the modified version of the

175
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:58,700
product with the system of config files

176
00:11:55,310 --> 00:12:00,890
and their system all because everything

177
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:03,740
so that's another another case another

178
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:06,529
guy and so he was more responsible to

179
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:09,560
delete the data there was he raised

180
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:12,439
everything said he lead everything so so

181
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:15,099
then zeroes commands everything but he

182
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,750
forgot only what one file we've been for

183
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:21,320
women fault he forgot to erase it

184
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:23,990
that can that contains so the history of

185
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,959
all searches the history of opening the

186
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:29,029
files jumping around files moving around

187
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,099
the files and so then in this little

188
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:33,400
file

189
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:35,890
so we identified IP addresses of the

190
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:38,260
command that he was looking to erase all

191
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:40,960
the information the name of the project

192
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:44,200
that actually was stolen that should not

193
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:47,620
be on his computer and all this all this

194
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:50,350
allowed us to do the following chain of

195
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:55,810
the Crick to recreate the chain of

196
00:12:50,350 --> 00:13:01,680
events so women for IP from SSH SCP to

197
00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:04,719
copy the leader then then further to VPS

198
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:08,530
so we gotta finish this is a VPS we got

199
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:13,120
this info so we wrote the provider and

200
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:16,540
the provider so then so the police made

201
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:20,020
the queries of the details was provided

202
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:24,969
the full source code was found on the PS

203
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:32,770
of the company yes how it went and we

204
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:36,490
found evidence but not not you cannot

205
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:39,550
connect the evidence to to the person so

206
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:46,120
then in other case so using the

207
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:48,520
vulnerability of MS 1701 zero on the

208
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,920
computer the cryptocurrency miner was

209
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:53,370
launched is reverse engineering showed

210
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:57,880
that they in a certain period of time

211
00:13:53,370 --> 00:14:03,990
this minor sin statistics to start C are

212
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:08,980
com domain and what happens so we just

213
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:10,930
looked and what IP server number is and

214
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:13,630
remember that it was not properly

215
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:16,209
configured so the virtual hosts were not

216
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:19,960
properly tuned so we went to this IP

217
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:25,810
address address and it reflected it

218
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:29,380
reflected his his blog so if you

219
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:32,319
remember they can always show a virtual

220
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:35,140
host so then the top config site will

221
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,570
open and the Sun actually opened up to

222
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:40,560
live the picture so his nickname was

223
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:44,200
found and his nickname allowed to

224
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:48,849
identify to track down this specific the

225
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:52,920
specific miss current in other case so a

226
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:55,720
github account to us was broken wait

227
00:14:52,920 --> 00:15:01,930
wait with private Bitcoin

228
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:04,510
keys school student so he transferred

229
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:07,839
some bitcoins to his account and the

230
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:11,050
payment service he left his email for

231
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:18,040
some reason did I can transfer some and

232
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:25,719
left email there was a domain it was a

233
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:27,790
domain registration we found his contact

234
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,610
a major storm password that was

235
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:34,150
connected to the business mailroom and

236
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:36,070
and if we enter the password so then

237
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:39,130
some of the numbers of the telephone

238
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:43,060
number will be reflected and the company

239
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:45,820
and its users list looked for the user

240
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:48,849
so which the end of the number of coin

241
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:50,860
size only one guy there whose cell phone

242
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:57,630
number coincided that's how we found the

243
00:15:50,860 --> 00:16:01,510
guy another case so that exercise

244
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:05,140
because of X CCR the site's illegal

245
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:07,689
access to the site admin panel was

246
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:10,689
obtained the company determined IP

247
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:12,380
address of attacker he periodically

248
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:15,230
visited the site

249
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:18,050
the incidence a few weeks after the

250
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:20,720
company realized that this company over

251
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:22,790
the period of several weeks had visited

252
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,790
the site and did something so you know

253
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:28,990
standard activity the company did not

254
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:33,230
want to call the police didn't want to

255
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:35,150
make this conflict lengthy so we decided

256
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:39,680
to do it ourselves just to find the guy

257
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:44,480
so what they did so they took his IP and

258
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:47,589
for his IP on the side so they uploaded

259
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:50,210
a clickjacking script

260
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:53,060
kliklak jacking and what is quickly

261
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:55,820
jacking the person visits the site and

262
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:58,040
he if he is authorized in contact so

263
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:00,830
then you can tell it can take and put on

264
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:04,520
the side for the whole brown screen

265
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:07,670
browser screen as transparent window and

266
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:10,400
if a person for any element aside clicks

267
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:13,970
and then then certain action will follow

268
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,790
so for example a second like like if the

269
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:19,250
person contact authorized and also they

270
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:21,800
kind of replace this transparent window

271
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,720
with this IP only for this guy this

272
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,240
mattress mattress and he is authorized

273
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:31,520
in the contact he clicked on this screen

274
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:35,450
and he liked the entry and they

275
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:41,150
identified his name they figured out his

276
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:45,560
background and started to finger him so

277
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:49,580
since I'm at the end of my time I can

278
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:55,639
tell you that if a person professionally

279
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:58,090
is a professional criminal and if he the

280
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:01,070
things about every step he is to make

281
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:05,000
but even you know even professional

282
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:07,909
criminals make mistakes and they can't

283
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,570
be identified everyone and makes

284
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:12,050
mistakes

285
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:13,600
all we have to do is just to find those

286
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,730
mistakes so

287
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,820
not talking about professional criminals

288
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:21,760
so next time thank you for your

289
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:23,730
attention is my contact with you if you

290
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:28,299
if you want to try to investigate

291
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:30,580
independently incidents that I have have

292
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:32,860
described so the simplified but you can

293
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:35,409
always they take a picture of this QR

294
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:46,539
code and then and solved these tests

295
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:49,110
yourself questions parameter okay raise

296
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:49,110
your hands

297
00:18:52,780 --> 00:19:00,050
your example with VDS and getting naked

298
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:04,040
data from this owners data most Russian

299
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:07,970
videos are in international videos how

300
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:13,129
often are we getting from international

301
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:16,640
holsters so as of about VDS related to

302
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:20,030
the Russian case I cannot divulge the

303
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:24,260
information but but not for foreign VDS

304
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:27,910
s do not provide any data Russian VDS s

305
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,910
provide data ok
