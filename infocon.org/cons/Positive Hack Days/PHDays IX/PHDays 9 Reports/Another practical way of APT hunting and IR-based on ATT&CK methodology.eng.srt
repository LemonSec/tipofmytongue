1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:10,709
practical our practicing epic unting

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:15,178
based on the attck methodologies so

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:18,600
first first of toys and showed

4
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:22,250
introductions of our team so our team is

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:27,150
named drag trip you can follow this

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:33,480
Twitter account read trip process number

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:38,570
seven and we were placed on the well

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:42,780
well after China Chinese secure vendors

9
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:45,660
name which named ancient technology and

10
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:51,840
we're focusing on threat intelligence

11
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:55,019
and apt tracing and previously all team

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:01:00,480
have been uncovered several apt reports

13
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:04,920
and the apt groups like famous one is

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:08,189
the ocean Lotus so a very short

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,729
introduction of myself a most senior

16
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:14,130
Street analyst and I am interested in

17
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:17,670
threat intelligence open source

18
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:24,090
intelligence retinas and mobile strat so

19
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:29,420
this is the today's agenda we we

20
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:33,450
published two research of about apt

21
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:38,240
threat global in the world to reports in

22
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:42,119
the previous year and we conclusion some

23
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:45,720
technologists the the the actors using

24
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:50,970
and and their activities in the whole

25
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:54,450
year so and also our in the the

26
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:59,039
intelligence about report in the report

27
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:03,060
is based on the true source of 2001

28
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:06,200
office our internal research an apt

29
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,750
straight and apt groups and the other

30
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,810
sources ball is based on the public

31
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:15,630
reports

32
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:19,170
for example from the the worldwide

33
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:22,470
security vendors and we also build an

34
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:26,390
internal a apt actors profile database

35
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:31,290
it's just like the meat organization -

36
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:34,709
so we thought that keywords of of the

37
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:39,540
apt threats chance in the previous years

38
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:43,020
is a list below then the spearfishing

39
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:47,130
most of the actors used the spear

40
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:50,130
fishing and to deliver the static decoy

41
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:53,700
documents or the deliver some payloads

42
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:56,700
and token and the malicious document or

43
00:02:53,700 --> 00:03:00,030
the malicious payload will excuse some

44
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:06,269
use some scripting language code to

45
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:08,880
execute and or downloading or load in in

46
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:12,920
a second in an next stage of the

47
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:18,690
activities and also the three actors

48
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:22,369
more preferred to use the system tools

49
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:29,910
or the system comments as coded like

50
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:34,230
level level and the attacks and the the

51
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:38,070
activity actors used mostly used their

52
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:42,560
custom developed tools in previous years

53
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:46,500
and but we also seen some activities

54
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:51,030
they are using the custom tool custom

55
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:55,290
payload and used some open sources or

56
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:59,780
public tools altogether in the one in

57
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:04,739
one Institute institutions or in the

58
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:08,450
tracked activities the we we do some

59
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:14,070
research on the meter a TCK metric and

60
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:16,339
they including 328 softwares and with 47

61
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:21,139
text tools

62
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:25,820
in the forty seven tools there's as 20

63
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:30,230
system you changes like the net that

64
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:36,169
command and the search beauty aisle for

65
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:42,580
and on the net and the right eye status

66
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:48,349
I status take the most public tours the

67
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:52,039
apt real world ABG actors used this

68
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:57,350
graph is based on the public report the

69
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:59,870
the left left clone is about some Fame

70
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:02,180
of very famous public post tricks or

71
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:05,360
explosion tools like combo strike

72
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:10,940
partial Empire meterpreter or something

73
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:20,150
else and next clone is about which of

74
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:24,740
which of the actors will use them so we

75
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:29,409
thought that many threat risk

76
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:35,080
researchers and the investigator used

77
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:38,720
the we list the ways below to analyze

78
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:44,300
strengths for example there they

79
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:48,440
analyzed and reversed some malware and

80
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:52,639
some payload and some attacking models

81
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:58,969
and all and finally we'll find the

82
00:05:52,639 --> 00:06:02,870
threat attribution by by using by

83
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:05,860
finding the similary of the malware no

84
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:08,930
payload and the overlapping of the

85
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:12,880
infrastructure using and also the

86
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:16,990
overlap of the GDP but I think the TTP

87
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:23,020
previously is very hard to tell because

88
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:27,129
it's based on the human description but

89
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:31,589
after the meter published

90
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:35,979
the the metric and the metrics of the

91
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:39,550
the collectors of the practical

92
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:44,469
techniques that actors using so we can

93
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:50,830
speak at at one language to describe the

94
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:56,139
the TDP of the director so our goal here

95
00:06:50,830 --> 00:07:00,339
is we would like to find another way

96
00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:04,059
based on the incident event data how to

97
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:08,050
how do we can process the event more

98
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:11,490
more more effect more effective and find

99
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:17,729
some evidence of the instrument interim

100
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:25,059
institutions of its lifecycle so basic

101
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:28,360
based on the basic principle of incident

102
00:07:25,059 --> 00:07:31,569
response or the stress intelligence we

103
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:35,409
our common workflow is like this we

104
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:39,550
first collect the data and we process

105
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:43,389
the data and to some strikes calculus

106
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:47,110
and cleaning and with we analyze the

107
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:53,949
data and we do the further actions so we

108
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:58,479
design an ant a tamato two feet or feet

109
00:07:53,949 --> 00:08:02,889
of the internal event log store all the

110
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:08,169
the some of the public infant event

111
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:10,599
format like this month and we we use the

112
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:15,849
data model to stand standardize the data

113
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:18,550
struck and describing the core the core

114
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:24,669
points of the entities and the relations

115
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:28,199
and we we also need to find to build our

116
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:33,938
custom rules set to find abnormal relay

117
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:37,479
behaviors so this is a screenshot of the

118
00:08:33,938 --> 00:08:40,140
system on sis my event filter rules so

119
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:42,570
so we abstracted

120
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:45,569
we can find the six-month support for

121
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:48,570
kind of behaviour the process behaviors

122
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:53,580
the network behaves as no fire behaviors

123
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:57,030
and the registry behaviors the the

124
00:08:53,580 --> 00:09:00,450
process will create creation create

125
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:06,650
another process and inject remote

126
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:13,500
stretch or or just access another

127
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:17,370
process process and in high-risk system

128
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:25,380
system immersion they support to monitor

129
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:30,270
the the tablet WMI inventor so we

130
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:36,450
defined define the entities here and we

131
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:40,530
and with with the properties list like

132
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:44,700
the fire the process the network the

133
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:48,600
registry and the endpoint and so on for

134
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:52,440
example the fire entity can can be

135
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:56,610
executable file or an driver or pipeline

136
00:09:52,440 --> 00:10:01,050
or stream or something else and it can

137
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:05,760
describe it using some properties like a

138
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:10,290
hash and fire fast by name signature the

139
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:16,439
detection name and also its format and

140
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:22,579
and some some if the file is an active

141
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:22,580
fire you can cut the file in India chief

142
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:33,260
and then we we we defined the behaviors

143
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:40,260
the behaviors is set of the entities and

144
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:44,970
their relations we define the five kind

145
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:47,340
of behavior here whilst each of them is

146
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:51,270
the process chance

147
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:55,710
and the network communication and fire

148
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:58,199
fire fire fire behaviors and the

149
00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:01,920
registrate behaviors and the final one

150
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:07,200
is the browser wise browser because we

151
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:10,670
saw many of the initial excesses used

152
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:15,330
the spear phishing email or used

153
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:19,050
compromised compromised of website to do

154
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:23,910
and watering watering hole watering hole

155
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:27,870
attack so if we can capture the the the

156
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:32,880
endpoint the use that the users visit

157
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:36,029
some links all these are all receive

158
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:40,890
some emails and we pick up some metadata

159
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:47,150
from it we can we can know that we can

160
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:51,569
know that the if if incident is happens

161
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:56,370
whether they they come come from the the

162
00:11:51,570 --> 00:12:01,140
the the malicious email or just click on

163
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:04,950
website link so the to describe the

164
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:08,370
behavior is like this way the process

165
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:11,850
chain behavior is like called parent

166
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:18,240
process execute and child process with

167
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:21,270
in with related file and at the point

168
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:25,050
and point at the data time so the

169
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:29,490
execute is the the relation of the

170
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:33,839
parent process and the child process so

171
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:37,339
how to find the abnormal behaviors so we

172
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:43,529
took we basically are based on the meter

173
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:46,709
meter a tcks metric and and we built a

174
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:51,779
customer ruth routine a rule definition

175
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:57,119
and the rule is in also in why when l

176
00:12:51,779 --> 00:13:00,180
format and it has a row ID you can fry

177
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:06,150
you can't even define you

178
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:08,939
attck ID or just customer ID and the

179
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:12,750
rule is the major part of the rule is

180
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:18,240
the curve query conditions where you can

181
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:24,210
define and conditions to filter which

182
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:28,220
kind of behavior and and filter which of

183
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:32,970
the key words such keywords in the

184
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:34,950
entity's properties and with support and

185
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:39,750
a very simple

186
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:44,840
match match functions here to support

187
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:48,450
no no case no case search and regular

188
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:53,460
expressions and some basic logic and

189
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:58,260
support or or and and note this is the

190
00:13:53,460 --> 00:14:04,700
example of the the rule for detect the

191
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:07,319
wing Logan helper T al so we can first

192
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:12,990
we can define too kind

193
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:16,710
q kind of rule to detect the the normal

194
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:20,510
behavior is modifying the register of

195
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:26,250
the wing Logan and actor using useless

196
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:35,120
we Logan register can load the militia

197
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:39,330
stereo in in the login or logout so the

198
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:44,280
the match the match true is one of the

199
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:48,510
metro is to to match the register path

200
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:53,100
and the other is to match the process

201
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:57,720
change the the image the process command

202
00:14:53,100 --> 00:15:03,530
line because some sometimes the the

203
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:08,790
actor may use to use a command to true

204
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:11,750
to modify the registry by the commander

205
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:14,990
re G but you

206
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:20,260
the register Keys need some permissions

207
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:24,110
they will not permit it so it will only

208
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:27,920
the the the behavior will only happens

209
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:33,890
in the proc process behave behavior are

210
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:37,520
not and not in the register behavior so

211
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:41,090
the next is example of the scheduled

212
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:45,829
tasks we can use the red regular

213
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:50,150
expression here to to match all kind all

214
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:53,410
version of architectures and we also

215
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:57,680
filtered the the command line parameter

216
00:15:53,410 --> 00:16:01,040
to filter only we our attention about

217
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:08,689
the creation creation of the scheduled

218
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:12,469
tasks so and we also did if I can't

219
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:15,950
define our customer rules like we we are

220
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:20,030
finding some abnormal office exclusion

221
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:23,120
the when an office like the world and

222
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:27,380
Excel to execute and command line or

223
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:34,940
excuse and and PowerShell it will be a

224
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:38,740
behave and normal behavior so so this is

225
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:43,250
our code data model of the how how to

226
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:47,390
standardize the events and how to make

227
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:54,110
our rules to to filter rate and we still

228
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:59,210
have some explanations on how how we

229
00:16:54,110 --> 00:17:02,360
find the abnormal event here the the

230
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:06,740
first one is how to find among the

231
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:10,819
abnormal box process chain and if the

232
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:12,319
process chain is not covered by the

233
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:16,189
meter a TCK

234
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:20,079
so we status the frequency of the

235
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:20,080
real-world endpoint

236
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:26,920
and winter locks and we find the

237
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:29,879
distribution of the frequencies

238
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:35,470
frequencies okusama and point it's a

239
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:40,330
longtail problem so so we after we

240
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:43,990
statics the statistic the image of the

241
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:47,169
process path and we filter this

242
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:49,929
important part here and most of the

243
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:53,350
payload must malicious payload will

244
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:58,600
deliver their their initial initial

245
00:17:53,350 --> 00:18:03,240
bacon or initial tools into the the

246
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:06,668
program data file and the user's profile

247
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:11,580
directory because this directory don't

248
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:16,690
need elevate the prevail privilege but

249
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:21,250
if if they after if they have bypassed

250
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:25,360
that you the you a CEO or elevate the

251
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:30,549
privilege they can put malicious payload

252
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:35,530
into the the the program in stolen paths

253
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:39,160
or the system system directory to to

254
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:45,280
fake it malicious one the intruder like

255
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:50,650
the legal program so this is some

256
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:57,370
examples here so we can filter the image

257
00:18:50,650 --> 00:19:01,450
path here and we found an extra strange

258
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:05,830
process here like it is it is named the

259
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:10,750
word thought a XE but its path is under

260
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:13,600
the program program data directory so we

261
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:16,290
see some details will found that the

262
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:20,770
words the strangest thing is the word is

263
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:25,928
exclude excluded and partial closure

264
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:29,470
command so after we analyze the payload

265
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:31,740
here and we find find some more details

266
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:37,290
how how the

267
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:41,670
Atlas is doing this it put in use and

268
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:46,050
persist paper state model to create

269
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:49,680
create create the new sketch schedule

270
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:52,950
task about the word what dot exe file

271
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:56,850
but the water it takes exe files and

272
00:19:52,950 --> 00:20:01,890
while signature it it just used the tail

273
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:05,100
side load technique to - hello the

274
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:06,630
malicious one malicious DLL named

275
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:15,360
tap-tap-tap

276
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:18,840
- WIP m dot dot line at OTL and also the

277
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:22,699
actor used model to modify the classic

278
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:28,199
registry key to maintain the process

279
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:32,760
persistent another another example is

280
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:36,780
that we fire we like to filter some

281
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:40,230
normal command line exclusion and we

282
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:44,670
find the command line execution and pay

283
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:49,110
an exchange executable file under the

284
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:51,630
under the program data so so if you

285
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:56,219
familiar with the program data directory

286
00:20:51,630 --> 00:21:02,040
we normally the install program will put

287
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:05,040
data's with stop table name sub name -

288
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:06,300
directory under the program data but

289
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:11,940
like this

290
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:14,730
we found some exe or tal directly under

291
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,340
the program data so if this can be

292
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:20,730
strange

293
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:24,590
so after further research we for indeed

294
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:29,190
that actor is using the pizza admin to

295
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:32,610
download from the remote host and they

296
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:38,040
they use the piston in to download from

297
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:39,080
- kind of - two different malicious

298
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:42,740
domain

299
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:45,949
here and you download the malicious

300
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:51,500
payload from the remote and put it under

301
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:54,289
the program data so the next is find how

302
00:21:51,500 --> 00:22:00,190
to find them abnormal Network

303
00:21:54,289 --> 00:22:03,710
communication we also can filter by the

304
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:09,169
the course the process the process

305
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:12,820
causes the network communication filter

306
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:17,019
filter the process by its image path and

307
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:22,070
also we can use the frequency of the

308
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:26,210
communicate per endpoint we we focus on

309
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:31,250
the port communicate port or the user

310
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:38,090
agent if it's the communicators use the

311
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:41,630
HTTP proxy a protocol protocol we can we

312
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:45,500
can get a user agent and some of the

313
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:51,250
payload is using their specialist user

314
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:55,309
agent so we we can use the the real

315
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:58,970
workers or the real frequency of the

316
00:22:55,309 --> 00:23:05,600
port and user agent may be the militia

317
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:11,750
of normal ones so we can see here we we

318
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:15,949
show some example the program of the the

319
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:18,889
previous mentioned malicious executable

320
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:23,179
file and the program data here is to

321
00:23:18,889 --> 00:23:28,519
connect and normal IP address and also

322
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:32,630
the domains the malicious domain the

323
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:36,980
third questions how how to hunt for the

324
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:40,460
Spearfish so if so because of the six

325
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:44,120
month it didn't has didn't monitor so

326
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:46,580
many details information about the

327
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,939
network communication there was there

328
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:51,770
only cat got some

329
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:57,919
destination IP address destination host

330
00:23:51,770 --> 00:24:05,240
and port and if we if we use some idea

331
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:08,260
or or some defense difference to us it

332
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,760
will easily to collect some of the

333
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:15,250
endpoint and network communication

334
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:20,000
especially for some the users browser

the file blades are human we doesn't

339
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:57,289
 question pharmacy or speaker a

340

file of nutria he wa raja'na so first is

341
00:24:57,289 --> 00:25:11,679
the URL link so we found track p.m. if

342
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:17,779
you honestly clicked in position I think

343
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:23,690
in smarter and the witness I'd be smart

344
00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:28,299
this silk here NASA Spitzer a possible

345
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:28,299
problem yeah cottages in she was more

346
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:34,510
time so co-sponsored lay across them in

347
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:47,050
like in a foreign policies he

348
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:51,230
the car sink imagery is really a Takada

349
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:55,629
articleship relate fishing go fishing

350
00:25:51,230 --> 00:26:00,400
fishing was so cool this is closer to

351
00:25:55,630 --> 00:26:05,270
kind of encoding character corrosion

352
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:08,840
ro1s symbols appear that silly boy

353
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:15,040
website to bypass across most of a

354
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:20,090
mighty is the portal solution wired

355
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:23,050
directly to an IPO 81 malicious

356
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:30,010
JavaScript original things Joe script

357
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:39,379
impressive he took script published

358
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:47,450
cookies so much yes very good by the

359
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:51,230
user so the actors can say vamos link

360
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:53,840
most apologies this is nationally like

361
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:57,950
in the product analysis is the special

362
00:26:53,840 --> 00:27:02,419
financial issue especially in a file of

363
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:07,240
attack so fire for a pitcher the actors

364
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:10,790
often used vamos sneaky just a sponsored

365
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:12,450
actress net document document extension

366
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:20,659
named after

367
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:27,210
in our period Premiere Radio City

368
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:28,610
exotica this way and it later he knows

369
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:33,830
my name oh great

370
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:33,830
general Prasad Patel no you control

371
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:48,240
which document no community they can

372
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:51,810
catch watches characters while shortage

373
00:27:48,240 --> 00:28:00,150
- so you start build poster law when you

374
00:27:51,810 --> 00:28:04,020
foil aluminum foil and the windows will

375
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:08,250
hide the uh the UH the appended details

376
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:11,070
of the character and which which the the

377
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:15,900
fire is actually an executable file and

378
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:18,780
also actor can use the right right to

379
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:23,250
left over right techniques to hide some

380
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:27,690
some extension name on the fire a file

381
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:32,040
name and the spear fishing is don't not

382
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:35,780
only the delivery way and also the they

383
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:42,270
can used a Instant Messenger application

384
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:46,590
to delivery direct to the users and also

385
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:52,500
we we focused on the the file format and

386
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:55,409
the file extension a file extension name

387
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:59,220
is not match we think this is an

388
00:28:55,410 --> 00:29:01,020
abnormal rules to find some payload

389
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:06,930
delivery payloads

390
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:12,720
like the same public CVE

391
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:18,930
this series is used for vulnerable

392
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:20,759
vulnerable wing IR talks so the the

393
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:24,570
actor will

394
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:29,489
well made a malicious a CEO chief but

395
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:38,100
it's in a CEO chief but it delivers name

396
00:29:29,489 --> 00:29:41,399
we tells mr. IR extension so next is the

397
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:44,070
the timeline the visual you visualize of

398
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:48,389
the timeline through our activities and

399
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:51,330
direct abnormal behaviors is held more

400
00:29:48,389 --> 00:29:54,330
helpful for straight researchers we can

401
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:57,989
from the graph we can see the the

402
00:29:54,330 --> 00:30:01,590
abnormal behavior is in the work time or

403
00:29:57,989 --> 00:30:04,769
out of the work time so so we find well

404
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:09,389
we focus on the the abnormal behavior

405
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:13,980
out of the book time and and also the

406
00:30:09,389 --> 00:30:18,479
relation we sometimes we will find some

407
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:22,109
relations between the indicators or

408
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,899
between the observable data or in the

409
00:30:22,109 --> 00:30:27,928
instant incident data and we find the

410
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:31,949
relations for this we based on the

411
00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:34,649
graphic tool and put data in here use

412
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:38,700
their relations that we have easily find

413
00:30:34,649 --> 00:30:42,018
some some interesting results so for

414
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:45,239
example this is the example of

415
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:48,809
previously we used a bra graphic tools

416
00:30:45,239 --> 00:30:52,590
to solve the actors actors as

417
00:30:48,809 --> 00:30:58,129
attribution problems we find the two of

418
00:30:52,590 --> 00:31:05,789
the apt IP address in in public used

419
00:30:58,129 --> 00:31:09,980
overlapped with this IP address and this

420
00:31:05,789 --> 00:31:15,389
is more details of the these two of the

421
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:19,820
apt groups there have more and more they

422
00:31:15,389 --> 00:31:23,758
have many overlap based on the the

423
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:27,600
indicators and the behaviors here and

424
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:32,539
also like this one this one is true true

425
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:41,850
public reported IP actors use the one

426
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:45,658
when same domains so so we do the job to

427
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:48,539
to fit our internal event log and also

428
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:52,440
to two feet ESMA

429
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:56,970
so we process the system invent log here

430
00:31:52,440 --> 00:32:03,299
in module in manual ways used local

431
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:07,919
faster and then we export event data to

432
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:10,679
the CSV and we fast the CSV and and and

433
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:14,850
standardize the user to data structure

434
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:20,880
used we mentioned we talked about talk

435
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:23,730
to data model before and we can we can

436
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:29,510
process all different kinds of events

437
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:35,340
here and use the same analyze analyze

438
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:37,919
mode this is the system an imported in

439
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:41,220
the structure than importing in the

440
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:46,830
system we we can do some further

441
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:50,340
analysis so the next is the some cases

442
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:54,928
in the we found in the real world

443
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:58,699
apt attack attack while office the ocean

444
00:32:54,929 --> 00:33:03,539
Lotus is a famous very famous apt group

445
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:07,799
we publish the first public apt report

446
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:10,679
about this group in 2015 and if this

447
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:14,309
group is has a very high frequency of

448
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:17,610
the actives and all and most of the the

449
00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:25,340
targets are the organization in China

450
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:26,729
and also the the Asian East Asia is an

451
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:30,030
asian-style

452
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:34,140
countries and they they using the

453
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:36,899
spearfishing most mostly and use the

454
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:39,350
spearfishing to deliver the rate of

455
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,350
payload

456
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:49,460
and we also find ocean Lotus in in

457
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:56,740
recent activities used compa strike and

458
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:56,740
it's bacon for for the whole attack so

459
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:07,460
this graph is about we we find a several

460
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:13,460
endpoint in similar stops some net here

461
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:17,360
and there in there from the incident log

462
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:22,480
from this endpoint we can find some

463
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:25,790
relations and find some instrument into

464
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:29,690
institution details for the endpoint one

465
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:33,500
it's it's time eyes

466
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:39,020
it's the timeline of the PA abnormality

467
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:42,409
behavior is like this and we saw the

468
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:48,909
actor is using common lying or partial

469
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:52,790
to execute MPT MPT program to scan the

470
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:58,970
scan the subnet of the of the entire

471
00:34:52,790 --> 00:35:02,660
enterprise network and then they used

472
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:05,350
the natural natural chimera true to

473
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:08,750
filtering to get the WLAN

474
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:15,620
network interface faces details and

475
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:18,170
filtering that they that some some some

476
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:23,480
interfaces information there they are

477
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:26,720
mostly attention and also load Nate

478
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:30,650
lateral movements and later under

479
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:33,640
internal eternal discovery and they we

480
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:39,110
found the strange thing is the user is

481
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:44,600
used net use or the net net view and

482
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:45,440
used some net use the net views command

483
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:54,049
the true

484
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:59,270
connect with animals IPC or or the IPC

485
00:35:54,050 --> 00:36:03,980
ship and they they use a very special

486
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:07,009
account here the point pointing the

487
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:12,250
presentation is not clear sir so they're

488
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:17,300
using username started a support

489
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:21,080
underlined than 368 some something else

490
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:26,359
use this special username this username

491
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:30,819
is an special account name and in the in

492
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:36,100
the domain control server so so I think

493
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:41,170
that the actor is is to hide hide the

494
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:46,130
real the real ability is real behavior

495
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:52,250
under the username

496
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:57,260
it seems legal and he also used to

497
00:36:52,250 --> 00:37:01,220
sideload use the other side of technique

498
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:06,680
to run the malicious DL it's used a

499
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:09,129
white signature of the micro phase until

500
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:14,330
lambda

501
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:16,730
mo-mo Zod not a axc and you'll replace

502
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:20,140
it into the program tight heart

503
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:25,720
directory and well used

504
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:25,720
wmic command to run it

505
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:43,470
and also we'll filter can filtered the

506
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:47,400
abnormal behaviors used attck idea or

507
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:53,100
some other keywords to find similar

508
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:56,760
behave normal behaviors here for the

509
00:37:53,100 --> 00:38:01,860
endpoint - we can see some strange very

510
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:11,430
strange and special operates under the

511
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:14,190
registry so they also use an user named

512
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:20,460
support underlying the three six eight

513
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:24,690
eight but but it will on the timeline

514
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:29,130
here it will first delete the delete the

515
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:33,480
original supports user and then it adds

516
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:38,510
a new one name the state name support

517
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:46,380
the username and then added to the enemy

518
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:50,900
administration group this we were using

519
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:58,350
the graph graphic rituals to find the

520
00:38:50,900 --> 00:39:01,260
these two endpoint all used same use the

521
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:07,529
same patterns of the username used in

522
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:11,640
the net-net views command line so the

523
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:15,960
there are the actors you is using is

524
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:21,930
modifying these three register path well

525
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:26,070
is the the Forester cast foster cast

526
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:30,810
under the LSA and the second is we put

527
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:36,300
the support this support at underlying a

528
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:38,670
special user username under the under

529
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:42,870
the wing log and specialist can account

530
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:45,800
list this will hide because the user

531
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:47,410
first the actor you first delete

532
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:51,609
original use

533
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:56,230
and then at a new one but this new one

534
00:39:51,609 --> 00:39:59,440
will occurs in the we logon screen we

535
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:04,029
the the it will show on the slogan

536
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:07,960
screen so they used this register to

537
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:14,049
hide it to hide it and then he shut down

538
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:20,529
the the first account policy of the

539
00:40:14,049 --> 00:40:27,160
password set setting and then we found

540
00:40:20,529 --> 00:40:29,579
some some malicious domain in several

541
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:33,879
end point here so they they all

542
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:37,900
community communicate in one malicious

543
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:42,430
to me this is some graphic view of the

544
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:46,990
of the after endpoint communicate to

545
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:52,169
this domain the Third Point used some

546
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:57,160
special USC behavior they use the public

547
00:40:52,170 --> 00:41:01,210
the event event UN Command to bypass the

548
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:06,149
the UAC and they also can use the power

549
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:10,960
to to to download download and and

550
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:16,839
public UAC bypass model which is host on

551
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:23,099
the jet hub so this is the conclusion of

552
00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:29,220
the actors we previous talk about and

553
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:34,089
another group is about a public believe

554
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:38,799
publicly believe what is a attributes to

555
00:41:34,089 --> 00:41:45,519
North Korea and I also use spearfishing

556
00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:50,740
and it preferred some web some website

557
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:54,729
website compromised to to use some

558
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:57,910
compromised website for deliver payloads

559
00:41:54,730 --> 00:42:01,900
or to use the useless as

560
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:04,899
command control server they prefer to

561
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:08,530
compromise the interesting thing is that

562
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:14,020
they prefer to compromise some website

563
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:19,510
in South Korea so this is some exclusion

564
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:23,020
log and persistence and the user the

565
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:26,319
actor based on the event data the actor

566
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:32,079
is using pisshead Ming and scheduled

567
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:36,549
tasks to to create some persist payload

568
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:41,859
here and then this is corrections and

569
00:42:36,549 --> 00:42:45,759
the filtration in infiltration and also

570
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:49,980
we can use the graphic to see some

571
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:55,569
relations and between the took several

572
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:59,609
target endpoint so in this group it has

573
00:42:55,569 --> 00:43:04,240
a very special collection tool named

574
00:42:59,609 --> 00:43:10,210
named IRA are taught exe they are using

575
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:14,140
this special special model to collect

576
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:17,670
and achieve achieve attraction documents

577
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:23,710
and use a very special password here

578
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:28,299
missing user password here and in this

579
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:37,900
screenshot which collect the the TOC

580
00:43:28,299 --> 00:43:40,960
file and we and we find this this

581
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:46,260
similar signature here

582
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:49,680
then we filtered e-r e-r tours and other

583
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:54,160
events locks we can find some more

584
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:59,368
target endpoints so this is the

585
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:59,368
conclusion tcp of this group

586
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:08,450
so the final final thing is we do some

587
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:12,140
researches on the public post text

588
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:15,950
orange explosion tours and we find how

589
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:19,910
to recognize and if they have some

590
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:23,000
unique signature the PK and the

591
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:27,080
behaviors so firstly star Empire the

592
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:32,030
Empire support multiple payload and

593
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:38,230
listeners and we try them using Windows

594
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:42,500
HD a to to connect with the HTTP come

595
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:46,880
listener it is this the screenshot is

596
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:50,960
the SIS system an event log and the of

597
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:57,970
course the MSHDA will excuse and Porsche

598
00:44:50,960 --> 00:45:01,820
and then it will trigger and I the

599
00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:07,790
trigger and I explored process starts

600
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:11,390
and with some very special arguments

601
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:15,830
arguments in the command line if it

602
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:18,730
starts it is parent parent process is

603
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:25,430
just as we host and use data calm

604
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:29,390
parameter and and I Explorer is start

605
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:33,549
and embedding an impacting arguments in

606
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:38,000
the command line and then we saw some

607
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:44,000
some creation in temporary temporary

608
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:46,760
internet internet files here so so like

609
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:50,300
just like the process thought PHP

610
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:53,990
process dot HTML the this this

611
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:57,550
connection is based on because the the

612
00:45:53,990 --> 00:46:02,120
default profile of the of the Empire

613
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:06,200
communication is set to some statues on

614
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:10,900
Catherine postage TP protocol and the

615
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:15,009
UI's is the process the new

616
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:20,980
there's something else so actors can

617
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:25,300
modify it and also if I use the default

618
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:30,130
USC model under the in Peyer we can saw

619
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:32,590
this partial exclusion here because of

620
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:37,780
the entire core is based on the

621
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:41,500
PowerShell so we can see multiple

622
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:44,650
abnormal PowerShell create partial

623
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:51,790
process creation and communication here

624
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:56,650
so and and we we also find if you used

625
00:46:51,790 --> 00:47:00,640
the rack as well as comment in the

626
00:46:56,650 --> 00:47:05,950
Empire it will trigger some some

627
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:09,129
abnormal process chain and also the if

628
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:11,919
you use the WMI to exclude askew

629
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:14,730
something that it can easily not

630
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:19,510
monitored by the assessment

631
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:22,450
mm table and my event filter the next is

632
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:27,190
the construct construct make more

633
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:32,859
multiple stages and more listener

634
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:35,740
support so if you also we try the HTM

635
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:40,530
file to release and poll show it can

636
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:47,009
show here it also happens some malicious

637
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:51,610
abnormal partial exclusion came here and

638
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:55,080
with the special file creation the facia

639
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:58,270
the the file of the file created

640
00:47:55,080 --> 00:48:01,930
temporally in under the temp temp

641
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:06,550
directory with the dll the c-sharp fire

642
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:11,350
because the partial will execute the the

643
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:15,460
dotnet c-sharp compiler and the resource

644
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:17,180
tools so so this signature will will

645
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:21,349
figure out

646
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:28,910
weather is like come strike or contracts

647
00:48:21,349 --> 00:48:33,109
behaviors and now test-retest and

648
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:37,190
signature a plea please attack but we

649
00:48:33,109 --> 00:48:39,589
can't find some special arguments in the

650
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:43,510
comp comment the inner Java command I

651
00:48:39,589 --> 00:48:50,180
because it will exclude Angela process

652
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:54,470
but we we also can figure out that if

653
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:57,348
the applet is run and it will you it

654
00:48:54,470 --> 00:49:01,459
will trigger and create create remote

655
00:48:57,349 --> 00:49:08,599
threat event and we it will execute

656
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:11,810
execute and Randle process so this is

657
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:15,980
short conclusion of a combo strike and

658
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:19,250
commerce I support multiple multiple

659
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:24,349
payloads here and we we also saw the

660
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:28,750
ocean Lotus the apt group is preferred

661
00:49:24,349 --> 00:49:33,790
to use this this post post explosion

662
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:38,420
tools and it will use the arcade craft

663
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:45,279
generated by the contract and up to some

664
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:49,520
of observations and to in to defend to

665
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:52,270
to bypass the difference to us and I

666
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:59,420
think we think the the some of the

667
00:49:52,270 --> 00:50:05,839
comment is is to is can it can be easily

668
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:09,020
to fake some process of normal Tomo

669
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:13,400
process behavior here for example to

670
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:17,569
argue it was proved the argument softer

671
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:20,839
of the comment the process actually

672
00:50:17,569 --> 00:50:24,890
doing and the PPID and the spawn true

673
00:50:20,839 --> 00:50:27,250
easter is to break the real chain of the

674
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:32,049
proxy process

675
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:37,310
question sorry

676
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:42,260
so finally the conclusion here so we

677
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:46,310
have to opinion here my office the user

678
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:48,740
the apt group how they're choosing the

679
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:55,130
custom develop towards all the public

680
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:58,729
tools we think it's based on the the a

681
00:50:55,130 --> 00:51:01,520
particular groups cost if because there

682
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:04,940
are you if they are using the cut motive

683
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:11,300
develop trust it will cost much of time

684
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:14,330
to develop test updates and make it make

685
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:18,170
it test on the several architecture

686
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:22,220
system and make a quirky correct on the

687
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:26,360
target PC so it will cost much time and

688
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:30,799
much work to do and it will also remain

689
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:34,820
some attribution signatures and based on

690
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:38,360
the cosmic payload but if they chose the

691
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:44,510
public tools they can easily do in these

692
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:47,930
things and in a faster way so so I think

693
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:51,320
the there this is maybe the reason of

694
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:55,609
nowadays the apt attack more and more

695
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:59,990
actors will use the public tools or the

696
00:51:55,610 --> 00:52:05,870
living of land techniques here when X is

697
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:12,339
the based on the event loads we can help

698
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:16,160
us to improve some improves on the

699
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:19,520
threat hunting based on the database the

700
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:22,520
data view we can find some data

701
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:25,610
relations between the activities and

702
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:30,080
also their their to find some more

703
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:34,970
evidence after they they break into an

704
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:35,810
enterprise and to do some later or later

705
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:41,049
remove

706
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:43,610
movement and all and internal discovered

707
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:49,460
behaviors in the instrument like

708
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:55,900
institution life circle here so this is

709
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:55,900
today my topic so any questions

710
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,348
thank you

711
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:34,460
thanks for your speaking so my question

712
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:39,799
is when the attackers use particles such

713
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:43,070
Empire also and took demising that tools

714
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:52,910
with their own capabilities of

715
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:57,860
obfuscation how what do you mean how how

716
00:53:52,910 --> 00:54:02,420
too hard to detect what i PT or what i

717
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:05,600
PT group used that was how to cut the

718
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:14,900
detect the customization of the truth

719
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:21,100
what do you mean about I'm not really

720
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:25,520
understand and I try to answer it so so

721
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:30,490
the question is about how to expand X

722
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:34,460
and the truth right question is when I

723
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:39,169
suppose I use Empire and customizing

724
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:42,860
Empire stages with my application so are

725
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:47,990
you a researcher your defender you catch

726
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:53,090
my stager and how to cut for you to

727
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:58,720
detect that I'm that I am that this is

728
00:54:53,090 --> 00:55:07,730
that this scissor is my own the

729
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:09,529
attribution of the pilot oh forget it I

730
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:14,480
will

731
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:14,480
Kentucky in the back Watts Thanks
