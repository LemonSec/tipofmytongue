1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,759
boys in Russia and if we're talking

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:07,979
about the NS attacks in 2019 but maybe

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,540
it's because like in the Wild West we

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,120
are going through your land full of

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,399
threats what a good girl good Cowboys

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,330
fall asleep and even can't Monroe mattis

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,130
so we have known for years about the

8
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:22,769
vulnerabilities surrounding DNS but

9
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,390
little has been done to fix them so DNS

10
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:26,459
attack has the kind of means to get a

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,439
bigger price and we have served our

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,599
great increasing attacks and million has

13
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,300
been lost an evaluation invaluable

14
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,790
information has been leaked but we want

15
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,099
this to change we want a good Cowboys to

16
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,200
wake and start fighting back so we are

17
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,030
going to show you who the gunmen are and

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,550
how they like the whiskey and how they

19
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,649
use their tools we want you to

20
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,629
understand the dimensions of this kind

21
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:50,760
of attack we want you to understand the

22
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:53,099
deep consequence they have and we want

23
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,710
to learn you to learn how to prevent

24
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,600
them and we want to show you how to

25
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,789
protect yourselves to protect your

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,859
secrets and the secrets of the ones you

27
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:05,670
love that have that don't have the means

28
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,659
to protect themselves but first let's

29
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,189
introduce ourselves

30
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:13,290
so I'm Valentina and my teammate is rude

31
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:17,880
we are both members of the little

32
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:22,439
Cantina celebrity we track a apts for

33
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:24,000
while in a daily basis and in this

34
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,059
presentation we are going to show you

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,610
the different types of DNS attacks that

36
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:34,530
we call the bullets then we are going to

37
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:38,280
review English public sources about DNS

38
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:40,439
attacks from 2007 until 2019 we are

39
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,509
going to see about the gunman which are

40
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:46,850
the IP T's and a little bit of

41
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,850
statistics about the state of this data

42
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:52,409
okay but the thrill every team does in

43
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:56,670
Argentina is to report and research

44
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:58,350
about three activities groups including

45
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,500
the mine where the tour's use and their

46
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,750
campaigns this is done to aid

47
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,299
researchers into knowing understanding

48
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:10,080
how a doctor behaves and how evolved

49
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,930
over time for doing this we we decided

50
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,790
to adopt the mitre attack framework

51
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:16,370
because that allowed us to better

52
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:19,250
understand and better communicate with

53
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:22,579
other teams and other communities about

54
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:25,640
their behaviors we have been done this

55
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:27,590
for almost three years now doing this we

56
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,559
don't only focus on current events but

57
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:32,720
also Impossibles this allows us to

58
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,370
observe how the ins protocol is being

59
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,040
abused for covering fictional

60
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:39,859
communication exfiltration and also

61
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,260
strategic compromise but first let's

62
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:43,959
introduce how DNS works just for the

63
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:47,388
sake that everyone is at the same page

64
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:50,930
we have here a little example requesting

65
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:53,389
a Spanish version of Wikipedia so first

66
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:56,840
when you wanna tell your browser to the

67
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:59,389
URL they will ask the recursive resolver

68
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,030
where the web page is if it's not in the

69
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:06,069
key share in the cache is going to go to

70
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:09,349
the root name server T as the IP for the

71
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:12,159
top leg of the Mende server and then we

72
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:15,230
follow until it got there to the

73
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:19,790
secondary level the - server to get the

74
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:22,459
whole IP for the e address it was more

75
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:24,769
or less like a telephone agenda where

76
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:28,459
you have the name and the IP address and

77
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:29,780
you just install between each other now

78
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:32,000
we are going to introduce the different

79
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,579
types of DNS attacks that we observed

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,940
that we call here the bullets which are

81
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:38,989
DNS tunneling hijacking and poisoning

82
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,829
first we're going to introduce a little

83
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:43,729
bit about DNS eternally so DNS tunneling

84
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:47,269
regarding a little bit of what we saw

85
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:50,629
before about the DNS how or DNS you see

86
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:53,269
that they will encode base64 data or it

87
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:55,429
could be in another coded method but

88
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:58,340
which is basically for for the example

89
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:00,260
and it will use them as a subdomain and

90
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,540
it will launch the request to the

91
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:04,370
recursive circle and then we'll go

92
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,888
through the fare wall until the Internet

93
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:09,470
until it treats the alternative DNS

94
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:11,329
server of the hacker domain which is the

95
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:13,790
C to come on in control but we were

96
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:16,250
afraid as it - mostly for in the next in

97
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:18,409
this presentation and so the Hat scare

98
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:21,409
will have all the information set in the

99
00:04:18,409 --> 00:04:24,740
subdomain and they will live after that

100
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:25,719
will lunch response it could be in a DNS

101
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,000
record

102
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:31,510
which acumen for the victim machine

103
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,880
malware here we have a simplified

104
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:36,909
example of DNS hijacking in which the

105
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:39,400
hacker has a way to modify the DNS

106
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:41,500
settings and the user is going to try to

107
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,690
access or to one of those and modify

108
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,220
size and it's going to be directed to a

109
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:48,130
malicious website instead of the

110
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:50,830
legitimate one this is the case of DNS

111
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:52,930
spoofing it's a specific case but there

112
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:55,570
is also another way of DNS spoofing

113
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:59,230
which is DNS poisoning in this case a

114
00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:02,050
user will attempt to ingress suicide and

115
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:04,090
the the DNS resolver doesn't help that

116
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:06,040
in the process so is going to ask the

117
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:09,609
Rudolf variety of DNS for the

118
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:11,680
information but when the root

119
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,200
authoritative DNS is preparing the the

120
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,650
request the attacker is going to inject

121
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:21,280
a rogue DNS entry into the servers

122
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:23,109
cachet so this way the answer is going

123
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,479
to be taken as a shitty mate and the

124
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,430
user is going to be redirected to a

125
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:31,419
malicious way but website instead of the

126
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:34,419
legitimate one so what we can see now is

127
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:37,090
the timeline for the attacks of DNS we

128
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:39,669
are going to cover until 2019 although

129
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:41,830
this timeline goes only to 2016 it will

130
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:45,039
further on we will see the whole

131
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:48,340
timeline and you can see the two types

132
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:51,990
of figures the certain ones are malware

133
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:54,969
pieces and the square ones are campaigns

134
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:58,120
so the first campaigns we chose was the

135
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:02,200
Julie Mayer case this case was in the

136
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:05,020
United States around 2004 schoolteacher

137
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:07,000
was given class to new students and some

138
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:09,700
what she was showing something on their

139
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,740
computer and it started popping up at

140
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,580
your content to them so she got

141
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:17,860
convicted for 40 years of prison and

142
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:21,000
given the absurdity of the case it got a

143
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:24,640
lot of international attention around

144
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,100
2007 this this sentence was overruled

145
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:30,039
and she only was forbidden for teaching

146
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:33,880
ever again but it's not that DNS attacks

147
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:36,310
were existed before it was the first

148
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,980
word that God like heat attention so

149
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:42,050
that's what we choose this one

150
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:44,330
at the section attack we are going to go

151
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:47,210
through it's called Operation goes like

152
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:50,450
operation Gauss click was an if SBI

153
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:52,729
operation that was how like the biggest

154
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:55,700
cyber criminal takedown in history at

155
00:06:52,730 --> 00:07:00,200
the time it in mobile and malware called

156
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:01,940
DNS changer DNS changer I'm sure some of

157
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,010
you will remember a time where you went

158
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:06,320
to a streaming web page and you got a

159
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:08,659
pop-up telling you to download I don't

160
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,460
know an additional plug-in to be able to

161
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,620
see the video well that's how this

162
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:15,560
malware work and it will hijack the

163
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:20,000
computer DNS records to point to a rogue

164
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:22,880
servers so trying to remove it was

165
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,310
really hard and a lot of people the the

166
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,960
rug servers were online maintained by

167
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,610
the FBI for a lot of time because

168
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,729
millions of people were infected and

169
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:34,580
they were lost internet connection if

170
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:38,000
they remove them so it's estimated that

171
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:41,419
4 million computers were affected and 60

172
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,090
stoniest went down for this fraud and if

173
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,970
they estimated that they gain around 40

174
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:48,250
million dollars u.s. dollars through

175
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:52,600
clickjacking

176
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:55,100
contagion exercises but this last

177
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:58,880
distress case is a financially motivated

178
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:01,090
but we also have seen since 2010 attacks

179
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,530
that are made it should make a statement

180
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:05,750
the first example we have a statement

181
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:07,729
that are made just for fun for sampling

182
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:10,190
2014 we have the case of Craigslist

183
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:13,400
where they did there were DNS fight

184
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:15,530
shocked at the register level the users

185
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:19,460
were being redirected to a prank site

186
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:21,289
but we have also observed cases of DNS

187
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,150
attack made just for the glory for

188
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:25,040
example this is the case of the Romanian

189
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:27,650
top-level domain in which the most

190
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:30,530
popular sites such as Yahoo Google was

191
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:32,929
being redirected to a hackers control

192
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:33,620
domain in which it seems to be like a

193
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:37,059
defacement

194
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:39,320
but we have also observed since 2010

195
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:41,750
statements that are made for political

196
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,140
motivations and for example the Iranian

197
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:46,400
cyber army or the Syrian electronic army

198
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:48,920
this last one deserves a special mention

199
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,260
because they used DNS hijacking in most

200
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:54,349
of their attacks this is for example at

201
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:57,319
the case of Harvard University's site in

202
00:08:54,350 --> 00:09:01,370
which this is the main image that is

203
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:04,640
there users were going to see but

204
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:07,670
talking about DNS attacks one of the

205
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,760
main big themes of DNS hijacking attacks

206
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:13,550
were sorry DNS spoofing is received

207
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,319
Brazil has also researchers have

208
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:18,979
observed a attacks in Brazil since at

209
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:23,360
least 2011 so the first case it was a

210
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:26,390
DNS poisoning attack at the ISP server

211
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,270
level so the older users of those ISPs

212
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:32,240
were being served with a pairing request

213
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:34,760
to download supposedly Google defense

214
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,540
plug-in which was in fact a bank

215
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:40,670
insertion the second wave were

216
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:43,370
compromising home routers to do the same

217
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:46,610
but the mimic English Java applet that

218
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:49,250
was also an insertion but we have a

219
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:51,710
observe a third wave that is interesting

220
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,810
because they attack a specific

221
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:56,120
vulnerability in the framework and they

222
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:59,119
at least six hardware providers a were

223
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:02,030
affected and that way they attempted to

224
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,190
they they achieve to compromise at least

225
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:08,540
four point five million routers which is

226
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:11,480
a lot so we have also served a attacks

227
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:13,969
that we're being using fishing social

228
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:17,990
engineering trickery to make the big

229
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:20,450
teams download also a also another thing

230
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:23,930
too to steal the credentials for the

231
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:27,410
breaking banking accounts so in this

232
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:30,199
last case since it was fishing it didn't

233
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:33,980
only focus on Brazil but also expanded

234
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:36,560
to US and China I'm speaking about China

235
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,840
we are going to talk about the first

236
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:44,359
case of DNS spoofing at the national

237
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:47,060
state level this is the great Canyon and

238
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,430
so I think that you all know what what

239
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,469
is the DNS and there sorry the Great

240
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:53,870
Firewall of China the Great Firewall

241
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:56,900
China is the means that China has to

242
00:10:53,870 --> 00:11:01,760
prevent this is its citizens to access

243
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:03,319
into central sites so we see that in

244
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,079
2002 they start

245
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,779
in DNS hijacking to redirect users to

246
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,359
blocked IP addresses but this was kind

247
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:15,160
of easy to for the sink invention tools

248
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:18,019
to avoid so around 2015 they start using

249
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:21,410
redirecting users to legitimate websites

250
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:23,209
were while and these end up being a way

251
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:25,009
of carrying out denial of service

252
00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:27,349
attacks through web pages that were

253
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:29,540
against China's addresses like for

254
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:32,829
example the great fire organization

255
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:35,149
which is an organization that helps

256
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:36,888
citizen from China to avoid the Great

257
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:42,410
Firewall there also

258
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:44,810
github was affected also some French NGO

259
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:48,889
regarding a freedom of speech and so

260
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:50,479
webpage in South Korea now we will to

261
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:54,410
the second part of the timeline which is

262
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,209
a much more targeted attack and the

263
00:11:54,410 --> 00:12:00,319
first redactor we are going to speak of

264
00:11:56,209 --> 00:12:03,680
is oil rig as you can see it's a very

265
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:05,930
active factor and you often use DNS

266
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,739
tunneling as a fuck back to fall back

267
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:11,750
channel for the cg communications what

268
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:15,079
is interesting about this thread group

269
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:16,639
they are suspected to be Iranian they

270
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:18,170
are considered to be expert because

271
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,779
they've done build their own tools from

272
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:22,880
scratch and they usually maintains a lot

273
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:26,060
of persistently to the systems that they

274
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,910
affect for a long time they are

275
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:30,800
motivated by some kind of advantage

276
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:36,199
being politically military or even

277
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:38,300
financially this this group loves to use

278
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:41,449
DNS for these communications to the

279
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:43,519
command and control or the c2 so they

280
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:46,069
usually uses for fishing attachments to

281
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,139
receive to incite the victims and they

282
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:50,569
can execute comments received from a

283
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:53,240
common and cultural through the command

284
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:55,069
line interface they they transfer the

285
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,160
information usually including the data

286
00:12:55,069 --> 00:13:01,579
with pace it 26 or basic with 64 and

287
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,420
they use a lot of DNS record types as we

288
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:04,849
are going to see next

289
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:07,279
so the first tool we are going to

290
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:11,060
comment on about all rig is helmet

291
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:14,610
help means it's our user a record

292
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:17,790
breakers are 84 records

293
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:20,519
and it usually encodes the data you see

294
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:24,329
it makes this different base 33 sorry

295
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:27,600
so we also have is an agent with JSON is

296
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:30,660
mTOR variant the difference with between

297
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,370
this last one is that a SM door job they

298
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:37,439
use of the NS for covert communication

299
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:40,160
but they also used for a DNS record

300
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,230
which is used for resolving ipv6

301
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:46,740
information and they use a sequence

302
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:47,310
number into the the let's say the

303
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,720
subdomains

304
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:51,479
they are going to use for exfiltration

305
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,029
data so in this is interesting because

306
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,370
they can request information to be

307
00:13:54,029 --> 00:14:01,470
retransmitted if they lose it and also

308
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:03,360
they can transmit data using the ipv6 as

309
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:08,279
a xs-xl decimal data

310
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:10,019
so these trick still is very much the

311
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:13,230
next is Alma communicator I'm a

312
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:16,290
communicator also used a deal-breaker

313
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:18,329
aid for its communication with the c2

314
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,920
it's pretty unique this is the only one

315
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:22,079
of the tool that doesn't have a fallback

316
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,689
channel so if it's not able to

317
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:27,630
communicate with DNS tunneling is not

318
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:29,520
going to work and it doesn't have a

319
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:32,730
config file the config file must be

320
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,829
brought by the deployer so another thing

321
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:36,779
about it is that the amount of data is

322
00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:38,790
able to transmit is really limited so

323
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:41,459
it's pretty noisy and slow for

324
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:42,270
communication we have also served the

325
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:45,000
use of Punt

326
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:48,630
of the year which is a very first

327
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
reported on November 2017 discuss a

328
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:54,480
basic functionality of the factors such

329
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,690
as download and upload a information and

330
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,990
execute comments and they used a DNS txt

331
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:03,449
record but to receive advice and common

332
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:06,240
execution but if that txt record is

333
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:10,050
blocked for some reason is going to use

334
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,990
a DA report as a fallback channel and

335
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:15,240
finally we have create agent waiting Ted

336
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:16,470
it's pretty special to use just the only

337
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:21,089
one of the tools that encrypt

338
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:22,800
communications and it's used the app-6

339
00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:24,690
records in order to establish the

340
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,670
communication it will establish

341
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:30,780
persistent using a schedule

342
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:34,589
tasks and the the encryption key will be

343
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:37,260
a story in a registry key created when

344
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:42,830
the malware is deployed it also have

345
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:42,830
father communication for HTTP and HTTPS

346
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:50,219
so now we are going to move to projects

347
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:56,670
our projects cherian was discovered by

348
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:58,830
Kaspersky around 2015 next this red

349
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:01,620
actually is suspected to be United

350
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:05,730
Stated regions this is not confirmed

351
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:08,640
obviously but their suspicion remains so

352
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:15,930
one thing about projection is that is a

353
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:19,530
really complex reactor and it used it is

354
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:22,500
DNS to in a long wanted mode so this

355
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:24,030
means that it tries to remain Stasi so

356
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,930
it will use it only to communicate

357
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:29,880
real-time status reports to the c2 and

358
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:32,729
also checks will trace some major data

359
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,500
for other amount of information or

360
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:38,000
bigger information it will use another

361
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:41,250
means but the interesting thing about is

362
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,750
it's one of the most complex characters

363
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:48,060
are there we wanted to show you with

364
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:50,910
this chart how big it how many tags they

365
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:52,979
use it's not color coded the colors are

366
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:55,469
only just for you to see the difference

367
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:57,330
between their tactics as you can see

368
00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:00,210
they will use you too as a command and

369
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:01,860
control and for infiltration it also is

370
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:05,430
able to infiltrate

371
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:10,230
air-gap networks which it's a sign of

372
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:12,780
how complex it is but we hope also dark

373
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:17,370
hydrous IPT which was first disclosed it

374
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:20,609
on July 2018 by Polanco researchers the

375
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:22,439
this specific group it uses my work that

376
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:26,159
is called Rock ravine and open source

377
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:29,550
tools - so this actor is expected to be

378
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:32,510
on Iranian an introductory and hub is

379
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:35,129
also a consider to be an expert and

380
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:38,310
their motivations or military and

381
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:40,500
political advantage so in the first

382
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:43,500
campaign that that researchers of sir

383
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,419
they have been using an come on excel

384
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,940
web query file to chop up our shea

385
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:49,950
butter which is Rock ravine that has DNS

386
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,510
tunneling capabilities what is

387
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:53,460
interesting about this reactor is that

388
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:55,500
they have a hard copy list of DNS type

389
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:59,250
records which are the ones that you

390
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:00,809
theater and they are going to attempt to

391
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:03,299
communicate to the command and control

392
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:05,340
with all of those records and the first

393
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:08,100
one that answers quickly is the one that

394
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,959
is going to be used as a channel for

395
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:13,980
communication through the trash on to

396
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:16,470
the government culture but we have also

397
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,480
observed of course in these kind of

398
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:21,450
attacks in point-of-sales and crypto

399
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,760
wallets and so the first case I'm going

400
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:27,179
to toggle here happen almost a year ago

401
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,730
in February 2018 when what black wallet

402
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:33,450
and reported to its users that they were

403
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:35,970
DNS I shocked so the attacker is called

404
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:37,559
control to the youngins panel of the

405
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,480
registrar and they changed the IP

406
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:42,120
address and all users were being

407
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,400
directed to hackers cultural domain that

408
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:47,219
was trying to get organized and they

409
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:52,260
also injected called to automatically

410
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:54,059
exfiltrate all money on the accounts

411
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:56,129
that called Martin Bedell immense which

412
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:59,039
was the point that they share they

413
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:02,190
exchanged and they that way they

414
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:06,450
achieved to stole four hundred thousand

415
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:08,429
dollars u.s. dollars this way they also

416
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:13,470
they transferred the money to another a

417
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:15,090
big big sorry a crypto exchange crypto

418
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:17,700
exchange platform which my speech works

419
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:20,100
and that way they change the world from

420
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,140
wrong with one crypto mining a greeter

421
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:26,039
going to another one and they hit the

422
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:30,000
tracks but we have also served this kind

423
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:31,650
of a taxi point-of-sale systems so the

424
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,330
first one the first cases that we

425
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:36,419
observed some point of these systems is

426
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:37,980
partner post this is the first case that

427
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:40,010
they used in s planning for a situation

428
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:43,559
of great car information

429
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:46,860
but about it thing why do they do that

430
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:48,299
so the great card ID the serial number

431
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:51,270
the expiry date

432
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:53,250
everything is little chunks of data so

433
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,670
these types of data perfectly fits in

434
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,830
DNS

435
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:58,500
records so that's why they use this kind

436
00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:00,510
of information so they are still using

437
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:03,570
this now they are a little bit more

438
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:06,780
stealthy in their way to infect victims

439
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:08,639
so they usually try to check if the big

440
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:10,170
thing is four feet resistance they are

441
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,160
running their service that they want to

442
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:19,710
to infect and also they mimic a city

443
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:21,900
maid service so just love me so now we

444
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:24,300
are going to talk about fin 7 fin 7 is

445
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:27,840
financial money motivated Fred actor

446
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:33,409
that uses DNS messenger as a tool for

447
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:36,360
its tax so fin 7 is suspected to be

448
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:41,640
Middle Eastern I mean it's a sorry

449
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:44,490
Eastern European origin something in our

450
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:48,690
charts so the main motivation for the

451
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:52,050
attacks is the financial game but what

452
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:55,080
we wanted to show you about this is this

453
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:57,419
tool is the first tool that we see that

454
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:00,720
implements a method to avoid being

455
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:05,130
detected being detected as DNS online

456
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:07,860
communication I mean if you see most of

457
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:09,930
the tool we see in coded data and send

458
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,610
it through the safe DNS record this

459
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:14,190
means that you are going to see in your

460
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:16,949
logs a lot of requests to the same to

461
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:19,920
mine and would see the same record it's

462
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:22,170
pretty stunning saying that this is a

463
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:25,290
DNS tunneling communication but this

464
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:29,430
tool what we do will change the DNS

465
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:33,270
record according to it wishes will be

466
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:37,260
USD a record e txt record and it will

467
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:39,510
also use almost random way to generate

468
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:43,170
the demise to which it will send

469
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:46,110
information using the computer the

470
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:48,360
information system to do it another

471
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:49,800
thing to notice about this tool if you

472
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,500
want to check it out a little bit more

473
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:55,230
it's based on a public tool available

474
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:58,740
and it only have that's called the NSTIC

475
00:21:55,230 --> 00:22:00,090
txt pwnage so if you want to take a

476
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,630
little bit more you can see something

477
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:04,379
about the tool over there

478
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:07,280
depression they use is heavily

479
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:10,410
associated with in both confiscation of

480
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:13,080
course we wanted not to let a Android

481
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:15,870
outside this we hope also Serbian s5

482
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:18,240
shocking attacks for Android to insert

483
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:20,669
my worry to Android phones we have

484
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:24,000
served this researcher house observed

485
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:25,830
this campaign through made 2015 and last

486
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,040
reportedly active on April twenty

487
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:31,649
nineteen so it's probably active now so

488
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,899
they use the anezka shocking to job man

489
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:36,720
we're into the users phones they were

490
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:39,270
prompted to download a fake Chrome or

491
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,730
Facebook application which was you in

492
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:44,129
fact dropping roaming Monte's which is

493
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:48,450
also known as extolled or mock how you

494
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:50,370
may know those names too but they this

495
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:52,530
case is really really interesting not

496
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:55,020
only because of the great span of time

497
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:57,389
that they have been active but also that

498
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:59,520
they expanded geographically they just

499
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:03,090
started with South Korea then they

500
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:05,040
expanded to Asia then to the to Eastern

501
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:09,240
European countries then the rest of

502
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:11,760
Europe and lastly in April 2019 was

503
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,500
report has active in Middle East so if

504
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,290
we give him a couple of time maybe they

505
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:18,059
will reach her some dinner sometime

506
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:19,470
started using crypto my name young

507
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:21,660
software to yeah it's interesting

508
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:23,520
because they they didn't just a funny

509
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:26,059
geography believe it also technically

510
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:29,429
because they are now supporting iOS is

511
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:31,530
iOS systems and also home computers

512
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:32,970
because they also expanded in these

513
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:34,710
business they are not just dropping

514
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:40,100
magnet churches but now they are you

515
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:40,100
soon also crypto crypto mining a my work

516
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:47,540
so now we are going to speak a bit about

517
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:51,980
ocean letters which is suspected to be

518
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:55,590
Vietnamese apt it has a really complex

519
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:59,160
attack workflow and they're one of their

520
00:23:55,590 --> 00:24:01,530
preferred tools will be da Dennis factor

521
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:04,050
that is factor is usually used as a

522
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:06,629
first taste factor that will drop later

523
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:07,700
a second stack back turn this back there

524
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:09,660
uses

525
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:12,570
DNS channeling as a means for

526
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:16,409
communication we have seen it

527
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:19,850
the NSA and the NS null records and it

528
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:23,039
will encrypt the data you see in base 32

529
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:25,709
and other thing that is worth to mention

530
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:28,649
is that the last report issued by a set

531
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:31,500
about this backdoor establish that these

532
00:24:28,649 --> 00:24:34,649
tooling had now has a fallback channel

533
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:38,340
in HTTP POST communication if they is

534
00:24:34,649 --> 00:24:43,489
not able to communicate through DNS and

535
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:48,418
lastly we are going to see the last

536
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:51,059
alerts about regarding DNS attacks it

537
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:56,480
was first detected DNS espionage was

538
00:24:51,059 --> 00:25:00,450
first detected in November 2018 by Cisco

539
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:03,960
DNS espionage is suspected to be Iranian

540
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:06,330
Iranian Iranian threat actor and the

541
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:10,889
reason behind this attack is affected to

542
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:14,730
be credential harvesting they deploy you

543
00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:16,580
two tools one with the same name DNS

544
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:19,980
espionage and another one that was

545
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:21,918
fabricated later of the disclosure

546
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:24,600
what's called Karkaroff

547
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,950
the difference between the second tool

548
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,980
the first one is that the second to

549
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:33,059
introduce new anti sandbox methods do

550
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:36,899
you remain to difficulty analysis work

551
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:39,570
and it also use DNS records as similar

552
00:25:36,899 --> 00:25:42,090
communication what is interesting about

553
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:42,809
is that in the same campaign of DNS

554
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:45,000
espionage

555
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:46,980
researchers found out that the IP that

556
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,049
they were using in that campaign were

557
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:52,769
also being used in DNS redirection

558
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:57,149
attacks so in February 2019 I think was

559
00:25:52,769 --> 00:26:01,350
a lie right sorry general sorry if I

560
00:25:57,149 --> 00:26:04,709
reported about some DNS redirection

561
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:08,158
attacks also using DNS a records abusing

562
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:10,379
DNS providers admin panel DNS NS records

563
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:13,409
using compromised registrar or country

564
00:26:10,379 --> 00:26:15,870
code top-level domains resolutions so

565
00:26:13,409 --> 00:26:18,600
what is interesting about is that in the

566
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:20,939
report a fire water assess is that they

567
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:24,929
are probably not only one traductor

568
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:27,390
because of the of the growth of the big

569
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:29,040
that they have been attacking yeah the

570
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:31,260
other thing to mention is that they used

571
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:33,030
let's encrypt certificates to mimics the

572
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,830
victims domain so they to abolish

573
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:36,660
suspicions from the user so the thing

574
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:37,919
that we the issue will notice was just a

575
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:42,870
little bit of delay within that

576
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:45,510
communication so this take us to see

577
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:47,459
Churchill after a final report saying

578
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:50,340
that they might have another Frederick

579
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:53,100
terrible Cisco published in April this

580
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:55,649
year and article about C Churchill which

581
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:59,760
is believed to be a nation state actor

582
00:26:55,650 --> 00:27:05,520
that's also hijacking or manipulating

583
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:07,140
DNS records so about this productor my

584
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,330
winner we wanted to show you it's a

585
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:12,750
little bit of the workflow they do they

586
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:14,490
will compromise as a service provider

587
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:16,770
for the addressed registry or the

588
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:19,440
registrar and it will use the

589
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:22,280
compromised accounts to manipulate the

590
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,780
records and get into the registrar

591
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:27,870
information and harvest credentials for

592
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:30,780
a second wave of attacks it centers

593
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:33,810
mostly they main targets were ministry

594
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:40,820
Foreign Ministries intelligence agencies

595
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:42,960
and some internet service providers so

596
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:46,139
now we are going to move a little bit

597
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,570
over the gansan data which is the part

598
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,980
of the statistic about this attack after

599
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:53,310
we bombed you all with all this

600
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:55,470
information so it is going to talk about

601
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:57,570
DNS hijacking common techniques I'll be

602
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:59,010
observing these attacks for example we

603
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:01,500
have several of the brute-forcing

604
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:05,670
attacks using dictionaries to attempt to

605
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:07,470
login into the the home routers a

606
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:10,530
configuration to change the DNS

607
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:13,320
resolutions we have also served a

608
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:15,000
trusted relationships a attacks because

609
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:18,030
they for example in the case of the

610
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,270
Brazil is very shocked the users are not

611
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:23,340
a they are not in fact the victims I

612
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:25,800
mean they are the victims that they are

613
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:28,169
not in fact infected with this but the

614
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:30,899
ISPs and that way they are going to be

615
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:33,660
redirected to a malicious sites and we

616
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:36,180
have also served ballot accounts as I

617
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:37,360
initial access because they usually try

618
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:40,480
to get it

619
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:42,959
for a DNS owners so they can change

620
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:46,420
their resolutions into the DNS servers

621
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:49,690
so about the DNS Italian common

622
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:52,330
techniques we have found that 78% of the

623
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:55,090
malware is deployed through spearfishing

624
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:57,090
attachments 50% of them establish

625
00:28:55,090 --> 00:29:00,490
persistent using a scheduled tasks and

626
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:03,428
42% of them uses PowerShell does I mean

627
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:06,240
of executing commands that the city will

628
00:29:03,429 --> 00:29:09,669
send them to a DNS tunneling and finally

629
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,830
30% of them will use fallback channels

630
00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:14,770
it could be that they use DNS and some

631
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:16,659
main channel and have an HTTP HTTPS or

632
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:19,150
another channel as a fallback it could

633
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:21,120
be that they have DNS as they fall back

634
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:23,799
channel for other communications and

635
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:26,830
regarding the records but we can see

636
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:29,650
here they have a clear preference for da

637
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:32,309
record although they will use others not

638
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:34,990
to and for the effect CT for encoding

639
00:29:32,309 --> 00:29:38,280
they will treat the IP addresses that

640
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:42,850
the situation them using as a binary or

641
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:45,160
ASCII data but now we want to give you

642
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:47,770
some kind of recommendations we are just

643
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,990
starting with the general ones such as

644
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:51,490
for example activating multi-factor

645
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:54,220
authentication of the mains and

646
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:56,710
importance to avoid attackers a

647
00:29:54,220 --> 00:30:00,750
modifying those or use UNIX password

648
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:03,370
password managers and we also have so

649
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:05,500
recommendations for DNS hijacking yeah

650
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:07,479
for example we recommend you to use the

651
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,490
security NS because they are a lot of

652
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:12,100
implementations to make DNS secure such

653
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:14,350
as DNS SEC or you can encrypt your going

654
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,770
your DNS communication with the NS

655
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:17,230
script

656
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:21,129
yeah you should all be validating your

657
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:22,510
DNS a and name server records yeah well

658
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:24,610
we also have some recommendations for

659
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:28,900
DNS tunneling that could be like blog

660
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:30,760
txt and old records or you can block

661
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,890
them the size of the packet that

662
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,419
receives but well I think when you get

663
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:36,160
all ready they what we wanted to say

664
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:40,630
that you should all be monitoring your

665
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:42,580
DNS traffic so this is kind of the end

666
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,840
so we want to thank you all and we want

667
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:46,000
to thank the organization to you for

668
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:49,439
giving us this space we hope you like it

669
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,419
and we really want we wanted to show you

670
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,330
how these were the impact they have

671
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:57,419
everyone we hope you understand and now

672
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:59,899
you you are able to start fighting back

673
00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:05,000
and we want you to all to start

674
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:05,000
monitoring your DNS records thank you

675
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:18,240
anyone has any question yeah hello first

676
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:20,009
of all thanks for coming to Russia and

677
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,779
thanks for this interesting overview of

678
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:28,019
DNS attacks my particular question is

679
00:31:23,779 --> 00:31:32,009
what may be may be some particular trick

680
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:33,539
is you can you can propose to ask how to

681
00:31:32,009 --> 00:31:37,799
monitor generous traffic's maybe

682
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:41,309
triggers or something like this I think

683
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:45,230
you know in our slide we just stated one

684
00:31:41,309 --> 00:31:50,129
for you to if you want it which is using

685
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:52,950
elastic and cabana plus row IDs I'm sure

686
00:31:50,129 --> 00:31:56,879
there are other ones you can use any

687
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:58,620
blog monitoring system yeah there are

688
00:31:56,879 --> 00:32:01,230
multiple things that you can observe

689
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:03,928
about the DNS communication for example

690
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:06,330
there are a lot that they are attempting

691
00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:08,759
to contact the same domain over and over

692
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:11,149
and over again so they are maybe suspect

693
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:15,360
or suspicious so you should check that

694
00:32:11,149 --> 00:32:17,908
information and any kind of not usual

695
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,758
traffic from DNS usually DNS traffic is

696
00:32:17,909 --> 00:32:24,240
not a it's not a monitor at all so

697
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:27,750
starting doing it doing that is just a

698
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,490
lot more than it's being done now thank

699
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:34,320
you

700
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:39,090
hello I have a question if we want to

701
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:42,418
resolve the man-like base64 that hacker

702
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:47,070
demanded calm what would be the answer

703
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:49,620
from the server the answer it depends on

704
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:52,139
the implementation of each each each

705
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:54,899
thread but for example there are ones

706
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:57,899
that the ipv6 or IP before information

707
00:32:54,899 --> 00:33:00,809
is useless binary or accessible data to

708
00:32:57,899 --> 00:33:03,029
drop an additional file or stuff but it

709
00:33:00,809 --> 00:33:10,020
depends a lot on the implementation of

710
00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:13,500
each one of the attacks thank you thank

711
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:15,899
you very much representation in your

712
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:21,990
presentation you tell us about some more

713
00:33:15,899 --> 00:33:25,049
tax in blast years and there was some

714
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:28,049
suspects on what date you was figure out

715
00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:30,870
the suspects of some of attacks

716
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:32,639
especially the last year I think you're

717
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:39,120
referring about the attribution of the

718
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:43,020
introductory right just of information

719
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:45,928
on the public reports okay yeah we

720
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:47,460
mostly use public report I mean the

721
00:33:45,929 --> 00:33:50,159
presentation you will have all day

722
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:53,429
biography we used available to consult

723
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,409
if you want we also use some Deloitte

724
00:33:53,429 --> 00:33:59,640
internal sources without not available

725
00:33:55,409 --> 00:34:02,340
to consult but we try to avoid stating

726
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:04,440
that some trajectory is from that place

727
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,850
or some way we use the word suspected

728
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,580
because attribution is pretty

729
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:11,609
controversial thing so we are kind of a

730
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:14,929
stadium while the the current actual

731
00:34:11,609 --> 00:34:14,929
Karen is saying right now right

732
00:34:19,329 --> 00:34:32,329
any other question I would like to ask

733
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:36,049
your opinion on why is it taking so long

734
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:39,169
for such taking says then s SEC and then

735
00:34:36,049 --> 00:34:41,859
I script to take over the place so they

736
00:34:39,168 --> 00:34:46,279
they have been for quite a while now but

737
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:48,969
the percentage of integration to mobile

738
00:34:46,279 --> 00:34:56,629
systems the net system is very small

739
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:58,459
white by it so I think you asked why it

740
00:34:56,629 --> 00:35:02,118
takes so long for people to start

741
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:04,039
implementing solutions maybe that yeah

742
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:06,680
we don't have an answer for that

743
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:09,079
actually we can no speak for the people

744
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:10,999
that's not implementing the solutions if

745
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:13,430
there are solutions but we don't know

746
00:35:10,999 --> 00:35:15,109
why why they are not you have the point

747
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:19,700
of our presentation is kind of urged

748
00:35:15,109 --> 00:35:22,670
people to start doing it and we can say

749
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:27,109
that monetary and manually DNS logs is

750
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:29,690
pretty heavy work pretty demanding and

751
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:33,308
tiring work so that's why we believe it

752
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:36,739
has been not having like in mind Li

753
00:35:33,309 --> 00:35:40,609
until now but we have now more means to

754
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:48,519
monitor logs with more how you say in a

755
00:35:40,609 --> 00:35:48,519
more comfortable way any other questions

756
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,880
okay

757
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:58,830
and we have seen the history of the DNS

758
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,259
attacks but I want to know if in the

759
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:03,690
last year's let's say two years they

760
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:05,820
have increased or decreased and what

761
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:08,820
they have in common for example okay

762
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:12,360
if you see our timeline let me show you

763
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:21,060
just quickly you can see that timeline

764
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:23,160
for previous 2016 sorry so the

765
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:26,220
determinant for decisive previous this

766
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:28,830
2016 is pretty wide and you have a lot

767
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:33,240
of space they are plenty of attacks too

768
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:36,509
but if you see after 2016 it's a clear

769
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:39,890
increase and we don't mention it but in

770
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:42,540
2018 there's an us-cert alert about

771
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:47,040
global DNS hijacking so it's kind of

772
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:49,440
being ensuring that is pretty little to

773
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,540
say normal but is kind of frequent now

774
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,430
yeah now it's going to it's being used

775
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:59,490
in more strategic attacks more than

776
00:36:53,430 --> 00:37:04,200
wide-open attacks no more questions

777
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:06,000
thank you very much well for listen to

778
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,919
us at an estate for hours until the end

779
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,440
and thank you very much pH day for

780
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:15,090
having us to here today thank you

781
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,090
[Applause]
