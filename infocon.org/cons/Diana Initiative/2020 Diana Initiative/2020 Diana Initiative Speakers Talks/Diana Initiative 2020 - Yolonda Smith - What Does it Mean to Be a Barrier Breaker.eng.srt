00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,080
careers particularly black women

172
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,159
i'm a barrier breaker and so are you

173
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,400
the theme of this year's diana

174
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,680
initiative is

175
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,520
breaking boundaries bite by bite

176
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,840
can i just tell you that i have been

177
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,280
walking around my house for

178
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,319
two months going fight fight fight fight

179
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,280
fight fight

180
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,840
bite by bite breaking boundaries bite by

181
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,560
bite

182
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,120
um and i promise you're gonna be doing

183
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,600
that

184
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,720
after this is done if you haven't

185
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,880
already but anyway when i was asked to

186
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,319
be a keynote speaker

187
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,880
i thought a lot about the theme and what

188
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,759
it means to be

189
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,960
a boundary breaker i feel like

190
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,560
especially in infosec

191
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,840
and in cyber security we tend to exalt

192
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,880
and uplift the image of the loner

193
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,520
quirkier than others but who's really

194
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,000
good at

195
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,039
computers those that seem to be able to

196
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,639
find the flaws and exploit the

197
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,479
assumptions built into data flows and

198
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,639
complex architectures

199
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,720
we celebrate the savants who demonstrate

200
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,560
deep knowledge of the ins and outs of a

201
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,360
technology

202
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,080
a system or process and can tell you

203
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,919
down to the register in the assembly

204
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,520
code the exact point

205
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,160
at which an exploit led to a jump which

206
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,599
led to the execution of arbitrary code

207
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,919
in our community it's just as noteworthy

208
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,080
to have a cve next to your name

209
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,479
as it is to have a patent and to have

210
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,199
several

211
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,000
makes you one of the one of the elite

212
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,440
the famed

213
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,960
infosec rockstar david bowie is my

214
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,000
representation here

215
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,599
that's what i think of when i think of

216
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,560
infosec rockstar

217
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,039
with a highly polished and marketed

218
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,319
named vulnerability

219
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,319
you can go from having a couple dozen

220
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,840
followers to having thousands seemingly

221
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,880
overnight you'll attract both the

222
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,039
adoration and the scrutiny of admirers

223
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,479
and trolls who want to knock you off

224
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,840
your pedestal

225
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,759
there's glory in that as well of course

226
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,599
we often assume that those are the

227
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,440
barrier breakers the folks

228
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,560
that were the first the loudest

229
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,879
the most seen and hurt among us but

230
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,800
history shows us that that's rarely the

231
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,120
case

232
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,080
today through examples from my own life

233
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,000
and by highlighting folks who operated

234
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,479
behind the scenes throughout history i'm

235
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,319
going to describe what it means to be a

236
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,240
barrier breaker

237
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,000
though we may touch on the individuals

238
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,520
who receive the credit

239
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,919
for a service or contribution we're

240
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,440
going to go a step past that

241
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,599
to look at the enabling factors the

242
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,440
circumstances the actions

243
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,520
and the people which led to the

244
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,720
eventualities

245
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,000
we all we may all be aware of

246
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,080
this is meant to be food for thought i

247
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,160
fully expect that this will be

248
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,039
a discussion for us to talk through in

249
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:29,520
uh

250
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,799
in one of the networking later

251
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,479
this is meant to be a foundation for a

252
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,640
larger discussion and not declarative

253
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,559
so i will present each topic as a

254
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,440
premise rather than a statement of fact

255
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,880
so premise one

256
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,920
it's not enough to do it once barriers

257
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,080
are broken through repeatable patterns

258
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,080
and predictable results

259
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,040
barrier breaking story starts in july of

260
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,040
2007.

261
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,839
i had just received my second united

262
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,160
states air force assignment

263
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,120
within 60 days i was to report to fort

264
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,160
meade in maryland

265
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,399
as part of the 70th intelligence support

266
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,839
squadron

267
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,080
for those that don't know fort meade is

268
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,080
the home of the national cyber security

269
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,720
the national

270
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,440
security agency and that is the

271
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,040
headquarters of what is now

272
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,080
the united states cyber command

273
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,680
my specific role was unclear

274
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,680
i was going to be part of a new function

275
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,760
called the advanced network operations

276
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,720
group

277
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,000
which is part of the information

278
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,720
assurance directorate none of that

279
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,720
meant anything to me i had no idea what

280
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,760
i was getting into

281
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,240
or where really where i was going i was

282
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,240
i was pretty naive

283
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,839
neither my current nor my future

284
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,440
commanders were able to tell me what i'd

285
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,160
be doing

286
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,800
only that we needed to staff the role as

287
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,480
part of the air force's commitment with

288
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,399
the nsa

289
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,800
suffice to say i actually wasn't really

290
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,399
excited to go

291
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,560
i was coming from the 48th fighter wing

292
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,920
which was based out of the united

293
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,040
kingdom

294
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,040
we had just passed our bi-annual unit

295
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,880
inspection and i was a

296
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,000
young single uh air force officer that

297
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,880
just wanted to

298
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,680
to roam carefree across the across

299
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,640
europe uh

300
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,720
enjoying all the the many uh indulgences

301
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,880
that that i could while i was there

302
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,519
legally of course

303
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,680
as a 23 year old first lieutenant i had

304
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,839
been named as an executive officer

305
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,320
having been taken under the wing of one

306
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,200
of the sharpest

307
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,040
most effective leaders i'd ever come

308
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,480
across

309
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,640
she was the highest ranking female

310
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,079
officer in the command

311
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,839
and she was responsible for the largest

312
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,480
mission on the base

313
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,800
she was a complete badass and i was

314
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,640
still very anxious to continue learning

315
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,079
from her

316
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,600
but a lieutenant's life is fickle

317
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,959
you go where uncle sam tells you to go

318
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,200
and when he tells you to go there so

319
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,360
typically for a single officer

320
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,800
you could expect to stay in one

321
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,640
assignment for two years before moving

322
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,519
on and my two years was up

323
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,760
i'd initially received an assignment to

324
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,760
go to korea for a one year tour

325
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,399
which i dread so much that i begged my

326
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,560
commander to pull some strings to get me

327
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,320
out of it

328
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,880
two weeks later my commander dropped new

329
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,720
orders on my desk to fort meade

330
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,720
throwing over her shoulder as she walked

331
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,800
out i can't do anything about this one

332
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,680
lt

333
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,519
better pack your bags so in august

334
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,600
i sat nervously in my new commander's

335
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,120
office hoping to learn

336
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,800
a little bit more about exactly what i

337
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,200
was supposed to be doing for the nsa

338
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,279
in my mind everything i knew about the

339
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,760
nsa came from television i was convinced

340
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,959
that i was going to be

341
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,320
in some dark nasty van

342
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,440
in some far-flung corner of the earth

343
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,959
listening on on on headphones to

344
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,480
to people acting in

345
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,920
illegal and and uh not so helpful

346
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,320
ways to our interests that's what i

347
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,839
thought i was gonna be doing

348
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,560
but i would learn differently that the

349
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,680
air force had a different plan for me

350
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,279
new commander really couldn't tell me

351
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,839
much only that what i was doing was

352
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,120
going to be high

353
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,440
on general keith alexander's who was the

354
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,200
director of the nsa at the time

355
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,000
high on his priority list i was going to

356
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,040
be the first

357
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,519
and at the time the only military

358
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,320
officer

359
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,000
performing the hunting mission on

360
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,120
classified systems

361
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,519
i met my civilian counterparts shortly

362
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,200
after getting my blue badge

363
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,519
and even they seemed a little unclear on

364
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,399
exactly what i was supposed to be doing

365
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,480
while i can't go into the specific intel

366
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,399
which led to these conclusions what i

367
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,000
learned was this

368
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,399
other nations had significantly stepped

369
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,639
up their intelligence gathering efforts

370
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,959
specifically in strategic locations and

371
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,320
specific and they were looking at

372
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,240
specific information

373
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,560
we wanted to know what they were going

374
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,279
after

375
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,200
what they were going to use it for and

376
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,440
why

377
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,120
being an air force member it stood to

378
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,959
reason that i had a better understanding

379
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,160
of the command structure

380
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,399
and the missions at specific basis and

381
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,240
could broker access with individual

382
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,560
organizations to get sensors installed

383
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,720
to be able to get the data we needed and

384
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,839
see what was happening on these base

385
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,160
networks

386
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,240
after installing the sensors we would

387
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,240
run tools that allowed us to pull back

388
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,399
data which should be scrutinized both by

389
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,639
intelligence analysts and security

390
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,800
engineers to characterize and classify

391
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,600
the behaviors we were seeing

392
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,600
though i didn't totally understand the

393
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,839
larger implications of what finding

394
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,120
something would mean

395
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,160
i dove head first into this assignment i

396
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,839
spent a bunch of time just trying to

397
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,079
learn the threat space why certain data

398
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,000
and information might be interesting to

399
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,440
specific threat actors

400
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,040
how they might seek to access this

401
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,839
information and what an actual

402
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,440
intrusion might really look like

403
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,000
this directly influenced my decision of

404
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,360
where to place the sensors and

405
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,399
ultimately

406
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,639
i took up the mantle of being the first

407
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,800
mission planner

408
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,639
my previous assignment hadn't prepared

409
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,839
me for this at

410
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,720
all to be clear my very first assignment

411
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,240
in the air force was

412
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,519
in the post office i had no i had no

413
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,399
plan for how i was going to do this so i

414
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,800
faced a very steep learning curve to be

415
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,519
able to be

416
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,639
effective in this role and i climbed it

417
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,680
i wrote everything down every process

418
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,040
every analytic tactic signals indicators

419
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,079
warnings

420
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,800
all of it we were starting to generate

421
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,600
some buzz

422
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,360
and the other services were interested

423
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,800
in getting some of their folks in the

424
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,440
door

425
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,720
to learn how to do hunting planning

426
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,959
became a poor a core part of the hunting

427
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,399
process and it started

428
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,760
with the initial learnings and

429
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,079
experiences we gathered with deploying

430
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:52,880
sensors

431
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,000
identifying uh clear targets clear clear

432
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,680
places to put those sensors

433
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,279
and being able to understand what

434
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,120
information was we were looking at

435
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,000
rather than trying to look at all of it

436
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,440
so

437
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,680
fast forward to 2008 i'd applied for

438
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,560
and won an opportunity to attend the air

439
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,560
force's first network warfare training

440
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,279
course

441
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,800
in destin florida i spent eight weeks

442
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,800
learning how to break things on behalf

443
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,639
of your taxpayer dollars

444
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,959
and by the time i was done i was ready

445
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,959
to turn my attention back to the

446
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,240
advanced network operations shop

447
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,639
when i returned my new role was as a

448
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,600
mission commander

449
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,440
working on a watch floor where we were

450
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,680
performing active operations to pull

451
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,519
data from each of those sensors that

452
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,720
i had deployed by this time we had

453
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,759
sensors deployed

454
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,720
in nearly every place that mattered we'd

455
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,720
established a set of processes and

456
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,800
protocols for handling and analyzing

457
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,440
that data

458
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,360
which made it much easier to spot the

459
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,360
anomalies

460
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,920
i walked into the building one chilly

461
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,600
morning to find my entire section

462
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,240
buzzing

463
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,959
they found something overnight a piece

464
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,240
of malware known externally as

465
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,240
agent.btz was attempting to beacon back

466
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,079
to a command and control node from our

467
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,320
classified network

468
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,440
that's not what you want to see

469
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,959
but glad we caught it it turns out

470
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,959
that it had spidered across our air gap

471
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,079
environments after

472
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,920
someone had plugged in a

473
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,519
malware-infected usb

474
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,000
drive which was set to auto-run upon

475
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,920
being connected

476
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,240
this discovery set off a mad scramble

477
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,240
not just in my department but across the

478
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,639
rest of the nsa and ultimately

479
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,360
the department of defense the services

480
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,360
and the state department trying to grasp

481
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,480
the scope and intent of this infection

482
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,880
this is what became known as operation

483
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,839
buckshot yankee

484
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,720
through our work here we discovered what

485
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,360
what what

486
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,839
what was at the time the largest breach

487
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,040
in u.s military systems in history

488
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,440
it was this work that precipitated the

489
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,600
stand-up of united states cyber command

490
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,160
but

491
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,240
beyond that it turned a relatively

492
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,640
obscure practice known as hunting

493
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,199
into a national resource priority backed

494
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,319
by doctrine

495
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,000
and executed on the foundational

496
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,839
procedures that we built

497
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,919
without the work of ano you don't have

498
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,439
cyber mission forces you don't have

499
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,880
cyber protection teams

500
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,480
you don't have cyber combat mission

501
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,720
teams and all the fancy

502
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,039
cyber ish words that you can throw in

503
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,319
there that doesn't happen

504
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,039
without a l doing what they were doing

505
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,280
there were entire security product lines

506
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:33,840
that

507
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,240
spawned up on the basis of the work and

508
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,520
the processes that we

509
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,720
that we did it started with a somewhat

510
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,600
skeptical

511
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,840
but determined lieutenant that's me

512
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,840
so in my wildest dreams i couldn't have

513
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,520
imagined or appreciated

514
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,360
what hunting would be would come to mean

515
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,960
to the security community

516
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,880
but the barrier that was broken wasn't

517
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,559
the fact that we were the first or even

518
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,760
that we found something

519
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,840
it was that we made it accessible to

520
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,799
everyone

521
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,960
and we provided a framework to allow us

522
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,440
to measure success or failure

523
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,440
the effects of our work reverberated

524
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,919
across the dod including the air force

525
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,280
to which the 92nd

526
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,360
information operations squadron pivoted

527
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,480
their mission

528
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,400
and their practices to account for

529
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,880
hunting they will go on to become the

530
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,280
first

531
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,039
cyberspace operations squadron

532
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,400
supporting the national

533
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,840
mission in cyber command

534
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,200
despite all of this my mostly male

535
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,080
counterparts

536
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,000
at the time working on the offensive

537
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,320
side didn't see the value

538
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,160
they couldn't understand why there was

539
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,360
so much hoopla

540
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,840
it didn't involve breaking something and

541
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,799
it wasn't

542
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,960
the development of some esoteric zero

543
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,640
day so of course

544
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,679
it must be useless

545
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,679
but my story is certainly not unique in

546
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,000
that regard which brings me to my second

547
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,480
premise

548
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,840
premise two barrier breaking requires

549
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,039
tenacity

550
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,480
fearlessness and vision

551
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,400
does anybody recognize this person i

552
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,880
hope i hope some of you do

553
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,360
each and every one of us in on this call

554
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,320
and in this room

555
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,799
this room that i'm in owes our careers

556
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,360
in some way to this person

557
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,039
her name is francis e allen

558
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,679
she died on august 4th of this year her

559
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,840
88th birthday

560
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,520
though i'm certainly in no position to

561
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,559
eulogize her her story is so compelling

562
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,400
so material to today's discussion that

563
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,600
it would be practically

564
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,799
dereliction of duty not to bring her up

565
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,280
for those that don't know francis allen

566
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,120
is responsible for the design

567
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,679
development and implementation of the

568
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:46,240
modern

569
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,280
optimizing compiler the reason we have

570
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,400
software that works

571
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,720
is because of the work that she did

572
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,679
i'm going to say that again with

573
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,000
different words francis allen

574
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,840
created the thing that turns your

575
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,760
terrible high-level

576
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,840
human readable code into instructions

577
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,240
that an actual machine can understand

578
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,919
and execute in a reasonable time frame

579
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,520
i shared a link a link to the

580
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,000
presentation shown here

581
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,840
in it she provides a comprehensive

582
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,080
breakdown of the evolution of compiler

583
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,520
optimization designs

584
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,440
through the lens of each project they

585
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,039
were used in

586
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,799
though the explanations provided are

587
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,799
fairly straightforward it's important to

588
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,200
note

589
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,679
that each compiler design she describes

590
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:32,400
was met

591
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,280
with doubt and opposition every step of

592
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,600
the way

593
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,280
she excelled when you think about

594
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,679
what she did in the time in the time in

595
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,280
which she did it her work is nothing

596
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,200
short of extraordinary

597
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,360
to put this into context the first

598
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,440
computers became commercially available

599
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,200
in the early 1950s there were a few mom

600
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,960
and pop electronics companies that

601
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,640
produced commercial computers

602
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,679
and ibm wanted to get in on the business

603
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,600
their first office offering was a 701

604
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,440
a mainframe and they were working to

605
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,679
develop a programming language called

606
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:15,200
fortran for their next offering the 704.

607
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,600
fortran was important because it was one

608
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,360
of the first high-level programming

609
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,559
languages

610
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,840
out available before this assembly

611
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,679
language was coded by

612
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,320
hand i don't know how many of you took

613
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,320
compiler design in school

614
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,440
but doing assembly sucks

615
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,559
it's terrible since allen joined ibm in

616
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:41,760
1957

617
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,760
the ibm 650 had just been released

618
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,039
the computer weighed 900 kilograms

619
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,280
and the power supply weighed just over

620
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,200
1300 kilograms

621
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,679
that's this uh this one over here on the

622
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:56,559
right

623
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:57,840
that power supply is bigger than the

624
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,480
computer it's crazy

625
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,320
miss allen's job at the time was to

626
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,640
teach incoming employees the basics of

627
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,000
how to use fortran

628
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,360
which did have an accompanying

629
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,200
compliance compiler

630
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,120
but it took forever because it was

631
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,440
directly translating human language into

632
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,640
machine language

633
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,200
and it turns out that one thousand lines

634
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,159
of code

635
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:19,919
translated into one thousand lines of

636
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,200
assembly is

637
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,600
incredibly inefficient and when you have

638
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,679
extremely limited processing power as

639
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:26,559
they did in the late

640
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,080
50s this was problematic especially for

641
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,400
extremely complex numerical calculations

642
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,360
and transforms

643
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,919
like you might need for say code

644
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,000
breaking

645
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
could have been going on in the 1950s

646
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,559
which might require code breaking

647
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,000
the world will never know anyway

648
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,400
two years after she arrived at ibm she

649
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,480
was assigned to work on a contract with

650
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,520
the nsa

651
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,520
as part of their harvest project and

652
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,120
manage the compiler optimization team

653
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,559
now again let's put this into context

654
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,360
here's a woman a very smart woman but a

655
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,120
young woman in her 20s

656
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,919
in the 1950s telling a bunch of older

657
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,760
1950s dudes

658
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,080
that the compiler that they wrote to

659
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,039
break codes

660
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,600
was too slow and they should move over

661
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,360
so she could do it

662
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,320
then she co-developed and installed a

663
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,360
programming language called

664
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,080
alpha which the cia used to rapidly

665
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,360
detect patterns

666
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,640
in almost any spoken language

667
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,000
that's the most baller sentence i've

668
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,840
ever spoken out loud that's crazy

669
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,200
to her credit and the credit of her

670
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,080
teammates

671
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,919
their success was predicated on an

672
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,480
almost maniacal focus on identifying the

673
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,159
problem to be solved

674
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,480
clarifying the desired end state and

675
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,720
doing the math to optimize the fortran

676
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,600
compiler

677
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,320
to be able to actually perform its core

678
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,960
mission

679
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,520
and allow the cia to automate and

680
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,400
accelerate

681
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,520
the code breaking process of course

682
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,600
this directly contributed to the code

683
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,840
making process

684
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,360
specifically the development and testing

685
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,799
of some of the early encryption

686
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:07,840
algorithms that we

687
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,600
know and love miss allen

688
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,720
along with her colleague john cook ended

689
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,000
up re-architecting

690
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,320
and designing abstractions algorithms

691
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,520
and implementations

692
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,919
that made automatic program optimization

693
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:22,799
possible

694
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,960
which not only laid the groundwork for

695
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,360
effective hardware resource utilization

696
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,279
but it also set the stage for another

697
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,480
innovation

698
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,520
parallel computing in the time that

699
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,440
francis allen was with ibm

700
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,279
they released mainframes for commercial

701
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,600
use developed and delivered personal

702
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,679
computers they created laptops and super

703
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:42,640
computers

704
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,480
after demonstrating that compilers could

705
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,360
be optimized and thereby more efficient

706
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,760
miss allen turned her attention to

707
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,840
automatically optimizing programs

708
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,919
then optimizing program execution with

709
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,120
parallel computing

710
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,760
then optimizing processor speed with the

711
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,520
blue gene project

712
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,960
this work spanned decades and she did

713
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,480
most of it as being the only in the room

714
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,360
and a lot of us know what that's like

715
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,480
for her work

716
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,039
she was the first woman ever to be

717
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,279
awarded the touring award

718
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,440
that was in 2006. that award is 70 years

719
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,360
old and the first woman to receive it

720
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,679
was in 2006.

721
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,320
the first one there's only been three

722
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,320
female award winners of the touring

723
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,440
award ever

724
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,159
70 years old by the way she was also the

725
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:32,720
first

726
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,919
woman to become an ibm fellow she was a

727
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,840
fellow for the ieee

728
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,679
and dozens of other organizations

729
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,080
devoted to computing

730
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,000
to be able to do all of this under the

731
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,840
circumstances she was in must have taken

732
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,400
nerves of steel and a level of resolve

733
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,120
that is incalculable she had to be

734
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,840
fearless

735
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,200
to make this work now

736
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,360
ibm's been around for a long time since

737
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,279
1899 to be exact

738
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,559
and they've always been a little

739
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,919
forward-leaning when it came to the

740
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,679
composition of their workforce

741
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,400
but they're also a company of the times

742
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,240
they've had women involved in every

743
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,679
aspect of their business from the very

744
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:10,320
beginning

745
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,039
and while i know ibm fan girl they were

746
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:13,919
pretty out of

747
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,440
pretty early out of the gates with

748
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,200
professional development opportunities

749
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,799
designed specifically

750
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,960
for women in technology and systems

751
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,480
engineering

752
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,559
for a company so long in the tooth

753
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,159
breaking in the upper echelons of

754
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,520
leadership and management

755
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,200
took quite a while considering how

756
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,679
ubiquitous their business is

757
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,600
the first female board member was the

758
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,679
widow of the ibm president

759
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,520
and the first few women in leadership

760
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,200
were in pos or

761
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,159
came from the sales department when

762
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,919
frances allen joined she might not have

763
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,039
been the only woman

764
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,200
but she was certainly the only woman

765
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,320
doing what she did

766
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,880
in her division when she first got

767
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,720
started she initially planned to leave

768
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,360
ibm

769
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,200
after paying off her student loans but

770
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,960
she stayed with it for the challenge

771
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,200
provided by the work

772
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,840
she likely had no idea the way her

773
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,880
career would evolve

774
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,760
but she labored toward a vision that

775
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,880
that there was going to be something

776
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,840
better

777
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,559
a better way of working a better way for

778
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,159
compilers to compile

779
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,880
a better way for programs to execute and

780
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,200
she

781
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,760
allowed that innate curiosity and that

782
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,480
vision

783
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,000
to drive the evolution of her career

784
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,080
over the years she began to champion

785
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,559
causes and initiatives to introduce

786
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,120
grow train and develop women in

787
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:29,919
technology

788
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,480
and engineering roles and additionally

789
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,240
ushered many women into technical

790
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,600
leadership roles

791
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,240
today ibm's workforce is about 30

792
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,360
percent women

793
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,039
and i'm certain that that did not come

794
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,200
without his fair share of obstacles

795
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,640
which brings me to my next point

796
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,159
premise three barriers are in the eye of

797
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,799
the beholder

798
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,320
so this year marks the 100th year since

799
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:58,880
women

800
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,640
in the united states won the right to

801
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,799
vote for american women

802
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,960
ratification of the 19th amendment to

803
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,080
the constitution

804
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,760
which prohibits the states and the

805
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,360
federal government from denying the

806
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,320
right to vote

807
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,080
to citizens of the united states on the

808
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,840
basis of sex

809
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,520
represents a watershed moment in our

810
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,039
history

811
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,799
it must have felt like an exclamation

812
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,880
point on nearly a hundred years of

813
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,159
campaigning

814
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,080
bargaining pleading and demonstrating

815
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,880
every significant woman-centered

816
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,000
equality movement from

817
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,320
that point forward from the equal rights

818
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,840
amendment

819
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,080
to roe versus wade even miss magazine

820
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,720
and the women's march can be traced

821
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,720
directly back to the moment in history

822
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,520
when women

823
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,760
secure the ability to vote their own

824
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,159
interests and seek out representation

825
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,120
similar to their own

826
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,840
that's pretty awesome women have proven

827
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,080
again and again throughout history their

828
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,360
ability to organize

829
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,240
convene and act decisively towards a

830
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,240
common goal and interest

831
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,039
now susan b anthony is widely credited

832
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,240
as being the first

833
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,640
to lead and take bold steps to really

834
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,120
push the suffrage movement forward

835
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,679
in fact she along with elizabeth katie

836
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:16,399
stanton

837
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,080
who presented her declaration of

838
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,000
sentiment at the seneca falls convention

839
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,360
in 1848

840
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,760
are commonly referred to as the mothers

841
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,760
of the suffrage movement

842
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,159
but there were many people of all

843
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,600
genders and races who took

844
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,799
risks often at great personal expense to

845
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,200
ensure that women could enjoy this right

846
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,880
as much as their male identifying

847
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,360
counterparts

848
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,039
early 1800s i'm sorry in the early 1800s

849
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,720
women like gerena lee

850
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,840
were attempting to expand their roles in

851
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,559
power

852
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,240
and have their voices heard in one of

853
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,840
the few social outlets they had

854
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,559
church in may of 1848 miss lee

855
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,480
and a few other women from her church

856
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,799
competed for and won preaching licenses

857
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,559
in philadelphia

858
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,240
this accomplishment was a direct

859
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,840
influence on the declaration of

860
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,200
sentiments this was presented two months

861
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,320
later

862
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,320
along with the right which included

863
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,840
along with the right to vote

864
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,919
a demand for equality for women in

865
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,840
religion

866
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,080
in the immediate aftermath of the civil

867
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,720
war susan b anthony elizabeth katie

868
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,960
stanton and frederick douglass

869
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,720
formed the american equal rights

870
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,960
association with the expectation that

871
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,880
they would advocate for and secure the

872
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,520
rights for

873
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,480
all americans regardless of race or sex

874
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,720
to be able to vote

875
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,240
the u.s government said meh

876
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,960
black men the right to vote and so the

877
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,279
14th and 15th amendments were ratified

878
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,360
and women were left to continue their

879
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,039
fight for equal rights and treatment

880
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,279
under the law

881
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,120
having failed at gaining equality

882
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,120
outright and facing heavy opposition

883
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,159
from wealthy

884
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,720
east coast anti-suffrage lobbying groups

885
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,399
the suffrage movement evolved

886
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,080
and began to take root in local

887
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,000
communities mostly in the western half

888
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,679
of the united states

889
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,240
these early versions of lean in circles

890
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,519
sprang up across

891
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,159
near across nearly every state with each

892
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:12,799
one

893
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,279
advocating for and in many cases winning

894
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,960
more and more rights and freedoms for

895
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,120
women within their local municipalities

896
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,039
and state legislatures

897
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,200
as the movement moved east over a period

898
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,159
of decades

899
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,000
suffragette leaders began to encounter

900
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,440
resistance to the movement

901
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,960
along a singular point in the south

902
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,880
white women would not accept or

903
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,720
acknowledge the movement unless it

904
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,760
explicitly excluded black women

905
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,320
as the result suffrage leader told their

906
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:40,880
message

907
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,960
and their outrage to accommodate this

908
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,880
and groups catered specifically to black

909
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,039
women began to emerge around a corset of

910
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:47,679
leaders

911
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,080
who continued to seek ways to be part of

912
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,840
the larger effort

913
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,760
one of those individuals was married

914
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,039
church terrell

915
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,760
who pleaded at the national american

916
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,000
woman suffrage association convention of

917
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,120
1898

918
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,120
to include more women of color in their

919
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,480
efforts

920
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,080
she said seeking no favors

921
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,799
because of our color nor patronage

922
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,480
because of our needs

923
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,200
we knock at the bar of justice asking

924
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,240
for an equal chance

925
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,080
after being shunned from full

926
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,919
participation in general suffrage move

927
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,279
within organizations

928
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,080
ms terrell founded and led the national

929
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,320
association of colored women and was a

930
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,519
chartered member

931
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,360
of the national association for the

932
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,960
advancement of color people

933
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,080
the naacp

934
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,080
these women had to face not only the

935
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,240
burden of being discriminated against

936
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,720
based upon their race but also based

937
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,840
upon their sex

938
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,240
and they fought in the shadows valiantly

939
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,240
for rights they would never fully enjoy

940
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,159
until the passage of the civil rights

941
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,360
and voting rights act

942
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,720
nearly 50 years later when the 19th

943
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,600
amendment was finally ratified in 1920

944
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,320
black women like mary mcleod bethune

945
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,519
pictured here

946
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,519
exercised those rights under fear

947
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,399
intimidation and harassment

948
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,480
looking again at the outcomes born of

949
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,600
the suffrage movement

950
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,279
we can see that those women-centered

951
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,039
movements in the united states

952
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,880
have always centered the needs and

953
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,799
interests of white women first and

954
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,559
foremost

955
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,880
miss magazine is widely heralded as one

956
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,880
of the first publications to address the

957
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,640
working conditions for female sex

958
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,440
workers

959
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,279
highlighting their exploitation and

960
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,679
their disparities in pay

961
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,640
the first time we hear that women earn

962
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,039
77 cents to every man's dollar

963
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,320
comes in the late 1970s the first time

964
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,760
we acknowledged the pay disparity for

965
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,760
black latina and asian women

966
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,600
is in 1996. when we talk about roe

967
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,600
versus wade we must also recognize that

968
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,519
this legislation specifically

969
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,760
centered the desires of white women to

970
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,039
control their bodies

971
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,320
and their own health care outcomes today

972
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,399
black women encounter medical racism

973
00:33:58,399 --> 00:33:59,919
preventing and complicating their

974
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,440
ability to survive

975
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,279
generally benign procedures or even

976
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,360
receive diagnosis and treatment tailored

977
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,360
to their needs and conditions

978
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,839
and it must be stated that even today

979
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,599
when we look at political movements

980
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,280
where women are centered

981
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,399
more often than not the expectation is

982
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:19,040
to resolve the pains facing white women

983
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,800
before the needs of any other interest

984
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,599
group will be heard

985
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,599
this picture was taken at the first

986
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,599
women's march and it has become almost

987
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,239
iconic

988
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,918
because it perfectly illustrates the

989
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,320
disparity in the gravity the situation

990
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,199
for white women

991
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,679
seen in the background taking jovial

992
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,520
selfies and cute pink hats

993
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,839
clearly enjoying the moment versus black

994
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,440
women in the foreground

995
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,599
sitting with the simple blunt truth

996
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:44,480
spelled out

997
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,199
waiting almost resigned for almost

998
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,000
resigning

999
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,440
and waiting for everyone else to see

1000
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,119
what she sees and take in the

1001
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,320
seriousness of the moment

1002
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,679
well let's bring this back to cyber

1003
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,920
security

1004
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,680
over the last five years there's been a

1005
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,119
great push to

1006
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,880
introduce and retain women in cyber

1007
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,440
security and it's working

1008
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,560
last year isc squared estimated that 24

1009
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,920
percent of cyber

1010
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,920
cyber security roles were being filled

1011
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,040
by women or

1012
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,599
individuals who identified as such but

1013
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,040
when you dive into that number the

1014
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,839
breakout across

1015
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,040
races is pretty startling in an industry

1016
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,200
where security analyst jobs are expected

1017
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,280
to grow by 18

1018
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,079
through 2024 just three percent of the

1019
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,560
space is comprised by black people

1020
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,400
less than one percent of the space is

1021
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,480
comprised by black women

1022
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,200
there are so few indigenous identifying

1023
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,000
women

1024
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,440
in cyber security that it is

1025
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,240
statistically zero

1026
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,520
why is that i get approached fairly

1027
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,320
often

1028
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,400
by other black women who are interested

1029
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,000
in getting into cyber security and they

1030
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,440
want to know how

1031
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,280
i have to be honest this is actually a

1032
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,880
fairly tough question to answer

1033
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,119
and not for any technical reason like go

1034
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,119
learn networking and you'll get in or go

1035
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,240
set up a home lab

1036
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,359
and and and run run learn how to

1037
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,480
run uh metasploit and cobalt strike

1038
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,839
if you do all of those things you can

1039
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,240
get in not true

1040
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,800
the truth is that in a time where there

1041
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,240
are more rules available

1042
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,240
than people to fill them women in

1043
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,480
general and black women in particular

1044
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,079
are coming to the table with more

1045
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:20,960
education

1046
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,800
than their white male counterparts but

1047
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,640
with less practical training and

1048
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,839
experience

1049
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:27,839
experience that comes from getting your

1050
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,440
foot in the door

1051
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,280
and being given the chance to learn

1052
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,200
explore and make mistakes with the

1053
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,079
benefit of doubt on your side

1054
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,320
i won't get into the great certification

1055
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,520
debate here

1056
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,760
but for black women the barrier to entry

1057
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,079
in this community is crazy high

1058
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,680
and navigating through it while you

1059
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,599
watch people who are less educated and

1060
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:48,320
qualified

1061
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,720
at least on paper glad hand their way

1062
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,400
into the industry is frustrating to say

1063
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,680
the least

1064
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,760
furthermore if and when they do land a

1065
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,079
role they have to find a way to thrive

1066
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,680
and excel in environments which aren't

1067
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,359
set up to be truly inclusive and

1068
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:02,560
welcoming

1069
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,640
the effect of this is that the few black

1070
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,880
women who do manage to stick around

1071
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,480
now have to carry the weight of an

1072
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,240
entire community on their back

1073
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,960
while also being excellent at their jobs

1074
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,839
and by the way

1075
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,160
they have to do so at a value 40 percent

1076
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,240
less than their white male peers

1077
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,400
so who would want to stay for that that

1078
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,880
is not fresh

1079
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,720
sad horn man that's a sad horn

1080
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,720
as i was researching this topic i came

1081
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,560
across this image

1082
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,320
which includes the slogan from mary

1083
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,400
church talk mary church terrell speech

1084
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,079
at the 1898

1085
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:37,920
national association of colored women's

1086
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,119
convention

1087
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,320
it says lifting as we climb

1088
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,400
those four words say so much about the

1089
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,520
expectations

1090
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,400
placed on black women then and now

1091
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,040
because you see

1092
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,920
by 1898 the suffrage movement had truly

1093
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,560
begun

1094
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,720
to foment across the country but it was

1095
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,720
directly at the expense of suppressing

1096
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,119
the need of a particular group

1097
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,640
so while i'm amped to see that there are

1098
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,320
more women joining the cyber security

1099
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,520
workforce

1100
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,839
in the end i'm well aware that until we

1101
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,119
start talking about recruiting

1102
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,640
developing and retaining

1103
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,599
non-white female talent this barrier

1104
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,520
will continue to keep our organizations

1105
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,680
less secure collectively

1106
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,119
which leads me to our next promise

1107
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,720
premise 4 a barrier breaker makes things

1108
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,359
better for

1109
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:27,520
everybody in 1968

1110
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,440
shirley chisholm became the first black

1111
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,440
woman elected to united states congress

1112
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,440
representing new york's 12th district

1113
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,200
for seven terms

1114
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,800
though she did not ultimately earn the

1115
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,320
nomination

1116
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,160
she was also the first black woman to

1117
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,160
compete for a major party's presidential

1118
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:42,960
nomination

1119
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,000
when she campaigned in 1972

1120
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,839
though those were notable achievements

1121
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,839
her time as a slave a state legislator

1122
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,839
was especially interesting

1123
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,680
shirley chisholm was born in brooklyn to

1124
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,040
immigrant parents

1125
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,480
and grew up in barbados with her

1126
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,320
grandmother

1127
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,480
she carried a strong west indian accent

1128
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,839
and people would you try to use that

1129
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,760
against her as proof that she wasn't

1130
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,160
american enough wasn't qualified for the

1131
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,119
job

1132
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,079
her parents were highly invested and

1133
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:10,880
insistent

1134
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,119
in her becoming well educated and after

1135
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,040
finishing college in the united states

1136
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,040
she pursued opportunities to promote

1137
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,720
early education initiatives

1138
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,720
and became an authority on issues

1139
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,440
related to child welfare

1140
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,720
once she turned her attention to

1141
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,960
politics she championed causes and

1142
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,960
legislations which struck down the need

1143
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,400
to have state literary

1144
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,280
literacy tests in english saying just

1145
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,119
because a person functions better in his

1146
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,160
native language

1147
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,960
is no sign that a person is illiterate

1148
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,240
hold on to that

1149
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,760
because we're going to come back to it

1150
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,839
at the end of this talk

1151
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,839
she also worked to get unemployment

1152
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,920
benefits extended to domestic workers

1153
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,599
and ensure that disadvantaged students

1154
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,079
could go to college

1155
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,920
shirley chisholm's first assignment as a

1156
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,040
member of congress was on the

1157
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,480
agricultural committee

1158
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,480
and she didn't want to do it she wanted

1159
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,640
to support causes and drive legislation

1160
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,560
which would benefit her urban district

1161
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,920
and in her view agriculture was not it

1162
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,599
but there was something she could get

1163
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:10,079
behind ensuring that the people of her

1164
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,079
district who faced food insecurity on a

1165
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,200
regular basis

1166
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,720
were able to gain access to the

1167
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,440
country's surplus food supply

1168
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,520
she partnered with bob dole to expand

1169
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,880
the food stamp program

1170
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,280
and was a key architect of the women

1171
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,960
infant and children program

1172
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,720
also known as wic in 1972

1173
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,640
she she introduced a bill to provide

1174
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,200
federal funds for child care services

1175
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,520
some of you right now are probably

1176
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,680
wishing that that that was a thing

1177
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,760
this bill ultimately morphed into the

1178
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,000
comprehensive child development bill

1179
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,079
which was supposed to create a national

1180
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,280
day care system

1181
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,960
which would enable single parents to

1182
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,319
work and care for children

1183
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,160
simultaneously

1184
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,680
it ended up being vetoed by the

1185
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,359
president nixon

1186
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,160
because it had quote family weakening

1187
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,440
implications

1188
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,359
in other words it would have allowed

1189
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:03,040
more women to enter the workforce

1190
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,720
the legislation that shirley chisholm

1191
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,480
put forth was meant to specifically

1192
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,079
benefit the people of the 12th district

1193
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,000
of new york but ultimately

1194
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,760
ended up benefiting people across the

1195
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,200
whole country

1196
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,800
through consistent partnership and

1197
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,880
coalition building not to mention

1198
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,960
capitalizing on the opportunity to make

1199
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,760
the most

1200
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,319
of an unexpected assignment congressman

1201
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:23,119
chisholm

1202
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,359
drove true systemic change on a national

1203
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,440
stage in a relatively short amount of

1204
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,480
time

1205
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,160
how does that hamilton song go

1206
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,119
immigrants get the job done

1207
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,359
and ultimately millions of families

1208
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:36,880
benefited from her work

1209
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,800
i can tell you that my family required

1210
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,160
the assistance of the wic program

1211
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,599
as i was growing up speaking of wic

1212
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,160
and food insecurity the topic of food

1213
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,680
insecurity is a subject that's near and

1214
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,319
dear to my heart especially now

1215
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,160
i work for a company whose mission is to

1216
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,240
connect people to real food

1217
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,240
when the covid crisis really started to

1218
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,240
ramp up we wrapped our brains

1219
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,160
trying to figure out how we could

1220
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,400
continue to deliver on our brand promise

1221
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,200
in a way

1222
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,200
that was safe for both our guests and

1223
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,040
our team members

1224
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,800
we quickly introduced new safety and

1225
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,560
health protocols including temperature

1226
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,280
scanning

1227
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,200
for both team members and guests across

1228
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,319
our fleet and the

1229
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,839
inevitable question came up what do we

1230
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,599
do with the data

1231
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,680
how do we conduct contact tracing and

1232
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,960
inform people

1233
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,520
that they may have been exposed how do

1234
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,960
we protect that information

1235
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,359
now i'm no healthcare professional but

1236
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:32,880
i'm vaguely aware

1237
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,800
that anything construed to be medical

1238
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,040
data deserves more protection than the

1239
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,720
average bear

1240
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,720
incidentally i'm delighted and i hope

1241
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,000
you'll be delighted as well

1242
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,040
to know that introduce privacy bills to

1243
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,200
dictate who may collect covid related

1244
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,240
data

1245
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,920
which mechanisms they may use to collect

1246
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,240
it and how long it must be stored

1247
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,240
who can have access to that data and the

1248
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,319
appropriate disclosure in the event that

1249
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:59,839
a positive test is discovered

1250
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,040
if you haven't already read the

1251
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,280
recommendations from accessnow here on

1252
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:03,839
the left

1253
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,000
i'd highly recommend it i've included a

1254
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
link to it at the bottom of this slide

1255
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,359
and these slides will become available

1256
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,760
to you at the end of this talk

1257
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,240
when the crisis first hit i approached

1258
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,920
other cyber security leaders in my

1259
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,440
industry with these questions to see

1260
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,880
what they were doing

1261
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,599
so sidebar i'm the head of cyber

1262
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,280
security for a multi-billion dollar

1263
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,440
company yet my peers in this space

1264
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,400
are overwhelmingly white and male why is

1265
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,400
that so important

1266
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,800
because when i ask the question how are

1267
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,880
we how are we ensuring that

1268
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,720
we can preserve people's privacy while

1269
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,720
still keeping them safe the answer i got

1270
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,200
back

1271
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,359
was focused almost exclusively on

1272
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:42,720
technical measures

1273
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,480
encryption and transit encryption at

1274
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,000
rest blah blah blah

1275
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,200
it occurred to me once again that these

1276
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,880
men had never had to deal

1277
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,960
with the actual safety ramifications of

1278
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,119
having their data exposed

1279
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,359
none of them had been harassed or doxed

1280
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:58,480
or stopped

1281
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,640
none of them were concerned about what

1282
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,560
impact a health insurance fraud could do

1283
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,440
to a person

1284
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,599
and thus didn't really get the gravity

1285
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,599
of what data exposure in the time of

1286
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,359
covid could really mean for their

1287
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:10,160
teammates

1288
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,800
or their guests they're not bad people

1289
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,560
and i don't want to paint them that way

1290
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,079
but they simply had no frame of

1291
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,160
reference to even consider that as a

1292
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,839
potential impact

1293
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,599
while being hyper focused on doing the

1294
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,040
normal security things

1295
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,280
what they didn't see was that there was

1296
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,720
an entire community

1297
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,040
that wasn't necessarily being served and

1298
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,560
there was an opportunity to put

1299
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,319
themselves on even stronger footing

1300
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:33,440
security wise

1301
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,319
by considering all of the ramifications

1302
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:37,359
beyond just

1303
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:40,800
unauthorized exposure of data

1304
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,240
we can see the consequences of what

1305
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,760
happens when these barriers are in place

1306
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,720
in tech

1307
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,359
i'm sure everyone recalls a situation

1308
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:50,160
when google rolled out their image uh

1309
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,560
their image search tool and it

1310
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,400
inappropriately associated black people

1311
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,920
with gorillas

1312
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,319
i'm sure everyone recalls the situation

1313
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,240
with amazon's hiring screener which

1314
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,440
disproportionately

1315
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,040
screened out women and people with

1316
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,119
ethnic sounding names

1317
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,960
i'm sure everyone remembers that time

1318
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,720
snapchat rolled out a lens that would

1319
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,319
allow you to perpetuate digital

1320
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:11,440
blackface

1321
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,280
only to see them double down two months

1322
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,200
later with the lens that perpetuated

1323
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,240
yellow face in all of these situations

1324
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,200
we have to ask

1325
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,960
who was in the room when that decision

1326
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,800
was made

1327
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,040
we speak in these lofty terms about the

1328
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,359
importance of diversity and inclusion

1329
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,520
but especially in security the value of

1330
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,119
having more voices in the room

1331
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,280
early in the decision making process and

1332
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,960
at all leadership levels

1333
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,960
ends up creating more secure products

1334
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,640
more secure services more secure

1335
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,240
applications overall

1336
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,760
how i'll use an anti-example

1337
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,839
if a product system or service is built

1338
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:47,520
with the assumptions of a particular

1339
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,640
user group

1340
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,319
and where and we're working under the

1341
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:51,760
assumptions that that user group will

1342
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,000
use

1343
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,880
in a specific way then we can exploit

1344
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,440
that product by having non-users

1345
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,920
non-targeted individuals try to use that

1346
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,319
system in a different way to solve a

1347
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:03,760
different problem

1348
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,599
a problem not specified in the docs

1349
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,480
we're humans technology is built with

1350
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,560
human biases embedded

1351
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,960
by building more inclusive teams we're

1352
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,680
able to expose those biases more quickly

1353
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,520
allowing us to develop countermeasures

1354
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,040
to prevent them from being exploited

1355
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,839
so what does it mean to be a barrier

1356
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:28,079
breaker

1357
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,960
let's revisit our premises number one

1358
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,480
it's not enough to do it once

1359
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,079
barriers are broken through repeatable

1360
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,560
patterns and predictable results

1361
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,040
number two barrier breaking requires

1362
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:39,920
tenacity

1363
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,280
fearlessness and vision number three

1364
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,079
barriers are in the eye of the beholder

1365
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,359
and number four

1366
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,440
a barrier breaker makes things better

1367
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,319
for everybody

1368
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,800
when we look at the examples the barrier

1369
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,319
breaking examples

1370
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:58,000
from these stories whether it be in

1371
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,480
threat hunting developing an optimizing

1372
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,599
compiler

1373
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,040
fighting for the right to vote or

1374
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,880
ensuring that children had equal access

1375
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,640
to education and a consistent food

1376
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,280
source

1377
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,800
we can see that they all have a few

1378
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,440
things in common the people involved in

1379
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,960
all of these situations displayed

1380
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:13,680
courage

1381
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,720
grit will and perseverance to overcome

1382
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,480
the so-called barrier in order to

1383
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,400
achieve a common goal

1384
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,480
in their time most of these people were

1385
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,240
not wildly popular nor were they

1386
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,480
so-called rock stars

1387
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,079
what the rest of history may call out as

1388
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,240
their legacy were probably relatively

1389
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,680
uninteresting events in their daily

1390
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,200
lives

1391
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,520
each of them built coalitions and teams

1392
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,240
of similar

1393
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,559
similarly inclined individuals all of

1394
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:40,800
whom wanted to achieve the same goal

1395
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,240
and were ready and willing to devote

1396
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,079
their energy to it

1397
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:45,280
none of the folks that i brought up

1398
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,440
today set out to be rock stars or to be

1399
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,960
barrier breakers

1400
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,040
that occurred as a byproduct of a live

1401
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,440
life marked by sustained consistent

1402
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,559
purpose-driven

1403
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:57,680
cause and initiatives don't those

1404
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,240
qualities sound familiar

1405
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,920
they should these are all the qualities

1406
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,680
that we expect in demand of anyone who's

1407
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,400
involved in

1408
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,440
cyber security so

1409
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,559
i suppose i owe you a call to action

1410
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,559
hopefully by now i've made my case to

1411
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,240
any skeptics that to break a barrier

1412
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,280
isn't one specific

1413
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,839
act but a series of acts sustained over

1414
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:19,599
a purpose-driven career

1415
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:21,760
it is the mundane unspecial things that

1416
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,599
we do every day

1417
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:25,440
it is a culmination of circumstance

1418
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,040
preparation planning

1419
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,920
prior acts vision drive and teamwork

1420
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,839
which make it possible to overcome an

1421
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:33,359
obstacle and break through to the other

1422
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,839
side

1423
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,160
you know there's a bit of an attitude uh

1424
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,440
in security

1425
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,800
that there's nothing innovative

1426
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,480
happening right now that we're

1427
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,480
trapped in a live version of the

1428
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,119
stainless steel rack

1429
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,599
i disagree with that to an extent i

1430
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,119
think for as long as humans build

1431
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:52,960
technology with biases baked in

1432
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,000
and yes even ai has bias baked in

1433
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,079
there will never be there will be ever

1434
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,160
evolving ways to exploit these biases

1435
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,839
which will ultimately drive innovation

1436
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,240
so i don't really have a call to actions

1437
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,000
except for this

1438
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,680
dream big but act small be undeterred by

1439
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,599
doubters and naysayers

1440
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:15,440
there is no need to set your sights on

1441
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,040
becoming a barrier breaker

1442
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,680
because you were already doing it i've

1443
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,280
been seeing lots of discussion around

1444
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,400
gatekeeping and who's

1445
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,640
really in security versus who isn't and

1446
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,160
i just want to say this

1447
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,880
whether you have one cve or dozens

1448
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,319
whether you've been doing this for 10

1449
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:31,839
minutes or 20 years

1450
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:34,480
you belong here and we need you and your

1451
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:34,960
talents

1452
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,720
your skills and your experiences to be a

1453
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,640
part of this community and to help shape

1454
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,680
it into something

1455
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,680
that reflects the world we actually live

1456
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,640
in your job right now is to remain

1457
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,520
focused

1458
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,599
driven in your purpose and to bring in

1459
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:49,839
as many people as you can with you so

1460
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:51,599
that boundary becomes less and less

1461
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:52,400
significant

1462
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,520
until it withers away

1463
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,000
my name is yolanda smith i'm the head of

1464
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,119
cyber security

1465

folks want to talk with me

1483
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,440

with me over at sweet green

1485
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,319

thank you very much wow that's an

1491
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,599
amazing talk

1492
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,920
you covered a lot of ground a lot of

1493
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,520
good comments uh in the

1494
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,440
in the chat there uh we did have one

1495
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,040
question that was able to capture

1496
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,000
uh there so what are some joe titos asks

1497
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:02,720
what are some good

1498
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,920
historical texts or resources that you

1499
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,359
would recommend to those of us who want

1500
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:08,960
to learn more about women and people of

1501
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:09,599
color

1502
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:12,880
in cyber and science

1503
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:16,400
so so i ended up pulling a whole heck of

1504
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,000
a lot of information believe it or not

1505
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:18,720
from the iu

1506
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,599
the ibm archives once uh once the talk

1507
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:23,040
is over i'll send you a link

1508
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,200
um maybe i'll throw it in the uh in the

1509
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,079
networking

1510
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,040
village but uh there's a the ibm

1511
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,720
archives actually covers a whole heck of

1512
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,400
a lot of ground they actually list

1513
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,520
every single one of the individuals in

1514
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,160
the women

1515
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,960
in their company that actually came and

1516
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,480
went from ibm and had notable

1517
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,839
achievements in computing

1518
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:44,480
i used that to spider out and look at

1519
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,839
and look at more information

1520
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:47,200
specifically about

1521
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,839
women in technology there's also a

1522
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:51,359
couple of books on amazon that i can

1523
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:52,000
recommend

1524
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
that talk about you know those early

1525
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,680
women in in technology and what their

1526
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,000
lives were like in the 1950s and

1527
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,240
early 60s when when they were you know

1528
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,839
they were the programmers

1529
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:03,520
you know swapping out punch cards and

1530
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,880
those giant computers

1531
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,400
happy to send you a couple links to that

1532
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,880
there that's amazing

1533
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,720
i can't imagine having to uh work in

1534
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,480
technology without you know the help of

1535
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,720
vs code and all the things we have today

1536
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,280
so i don't know how i would uh ever get

1537
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,800
anywhere

1538
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,280
uh another question uh brianna asks how

1539
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:21,920
do you

1540
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,640
manage uh self-doubt it's pretty common

1541
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,640
for me to feel like i'm not really into

1542
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,160
cyber security because i don't have an

1543
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,400
impressive resume or degree

1544
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,480
yeah that's that's a really great

1545
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:33,839
question and i'll i'll be

1546
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:36,720
real honest i struggle with it i i

1547
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,760
struggle with it

1548
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,359
that little voice inside my head

1549
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:41,040
sometimes does take over and says you're

1550
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,559
not good enough you're not smart enough

1551
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:43,920
you're not you're not supposed to be

1552
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,559
here

1553
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,119
but the way that i handle it and manage

1554
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:47,599
it

1555
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:50,880
is to really focus in not on the that

1556
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:51,839
feeling

1557
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,640
um and and what i don't have i try and

1558
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,640
flip the script and focus in on what i

1559
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,599
do have

1560
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:00,000
it's so important especially now when

1561
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,720
we're in this weird space with kovid

1562
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,880
to to not just focus on the things that

1563
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,319
you don't have and the in the

1564
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,079
in the losses but to focus on the

1565
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:10,240
positives and to focus on what you do

1566
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,520
have

1567
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,880
whether or not you have an impressive

1568
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,040
resume you're you're working towards

1569
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:15,680
building

1570
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,920
your resume and you're working on

1571
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,119
learning something

1572
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:21,599
rather than focusing on the hey my

1573
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:23,200
resume doesn't look like this yet

1574
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,359
focus in on the fact that hey after

1575
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:26,400
three months

1576
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,920
of hard learning and hard hard uh uh

1577
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,160
trials and tribulations you know more

1578
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,800
today about xyz subject than you did

1579
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,000
yesterday

1580
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,800
that's awesome if if if you can

1581
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,160
celebrate that if you can learn

1582
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:40,880
something new

1583
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,480
every single day that's a thing to

1584
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,079
celebrate and that's

1585
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:46,480
ultimately what makes you a better part

1586
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,920
of this community is because you're

1587
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,760
actively working to build up

1588
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,319
and you're actively working to become

1589
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:53,040
someone that

1590
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,640
does have that impressive resume and

1591
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,640
that does have the ability to

1592
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,599
to to be um you know sort of had that

1593
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:01,760
gravitas to speak on on a larger

1594
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,800
larger scale i'll throw this out too all

1595
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,240
of us were

1596
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,480
were newbies at one point i consider

1597
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,280
myself a perpetual newbie

1598
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,000
everyone started from someplace don't i

1599
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:14,319
would

1600
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:16,160
say don't get in the habit of comparing

1601
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,240
yourself to what everyone else is doing

1602
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,599
you focus on you

1603
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,280
you focus on what you're doing and where

1604
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,440
you're trying to go in your journey

1605
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,359
and you'll get there it'll take step by

1606
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:27,440
step but if you try and compare yourself

1607
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,880
to what everyone else has

1608
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,480
it it's going to get tough that's great

1609
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,640
and i love the example we had earlier of

1610
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,640
documenting all the threat hunting

1611
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,559
that you were doing and how that became

1612
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:40,400
the the standard for how to do it it's

1613
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,920
great

1614
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,400
uh see next uh question from uh catty

1615
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,400
bonk uh she's wondering how do we fix

1616
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,280
the retention

1617
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,799
problem the retention problem

1618
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:53,119
this is elana smith opinion okay the

1619
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:55,119
retention problem comes from building an

1620
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:56,559
inclusive culture

1621
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,440
and i know we think you know we're we're

1622
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,119
in this moment of you know black lives

1623
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,480
matter and we have the

1624
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,960
the attention of everybody but it really

1625
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,079
does become

1626
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:08,640
calling people to the table as many

1627
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,839
people as possible

1628
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:12,480
i'm a hiring manager and one of the

1629
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,280
things that

1630
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,680
i have challenged myself every single

1631
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,119
time i go into an interview

1632
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:20,160
is to think about what voice

1633
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,240
what problem am i trying to what problem

1634
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,520
am i trying to solve

1635
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,000
when i hire someone and what voices are

1636
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,680
not represented that can help me solve

1637
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,680
that problem

1638
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,839
the the pie graph i put up earlier shows

1639
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,119
that frankly

1640
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,760
the the the people that that have

1641
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,119
identified themselves as being an

1642
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:38,240
infosec

1643
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,359
are overwhelmingly white and male

1644
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:44,000
and when you consider the fact that hey

1645
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,280
i'm trying to bring in more inclusive

1646
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,880
voices i'm trying to bring in

1647
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,319
more people who are interested in in

1648
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:52,319
in diversity and making sure that we're

1649
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,720
fully solving the security problem

1650
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,640
how do i address their needs and how do

1651
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,640
i really think about things from a

1652
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,079
different perspective

1653
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:01,599
that's really where you can start

1654
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:04,079
chipping away at the retention problem

1655
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:07,040
is when you start saying hey you know

1656
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,480
who am i surrounded by

1657
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:11,200
every single day what what am i reading

1658
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,480
every single day

1659
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,960
what sources of information am i am i

1660
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,319
curating and cultivating

1661
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:18,640
and how do i switch that up so that way

1662
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,400
i'm getting different perspectives

1663
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,799
right and then honestly it's about being

1664
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:24,000
vulnerable and i know

1665
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,599
saying vulnerable to a bunch of people

1666
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,440
who are in security is kind of a faux

1667
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,079
pas

1668
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,079
but you have to be vulnerable and

1669
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:31,599
recognize what you don't know

1670
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:32,799
and recognize that you don't have it

1671
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:35,119
perfect be willing to apologize and be

1672
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:36,079
willing to

1673
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:38,160
to be honest about where you are and

1674
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,599
where you want to be

1675
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:42,319
um everyone makes mistakes but

1676
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:43,200
ultimately

1677
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,720
it's the act of working to to to

1678
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,760
evolve over time that allows us to

1679
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,000
to to build those inclusive environments

1680
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,440
which make retention

1681
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,680
a much easier problem to solve that's

1682
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,000
the ana smith

1683
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,079
you got uh just a couple more minutes

1684
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:01,760
and uh and two more questions so i think

1685
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,040
we'll be able to get through
