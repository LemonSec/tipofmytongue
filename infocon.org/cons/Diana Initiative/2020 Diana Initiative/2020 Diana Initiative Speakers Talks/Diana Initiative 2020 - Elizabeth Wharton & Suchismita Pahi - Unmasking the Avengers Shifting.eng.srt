71
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,319
hi guys uh my name is tsuchi pagi i am

72
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,879
a data privacy and cyber security lawyer

73
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,080
with

74
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,239
rally health which is a wellness and

75
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,680
tech platform

76
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,680
uh liz and i have been working together

77
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,800
for

78
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,879
a little over a year now on facial

79
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,959
recognition and algorithmic bias

80
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,599
and it's been an incredible space to be

81
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,159
in because we've had the opportunity to

82
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,720
um iterate on our talks so we initially

83
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,519
started with shmu khan earlier and then

84
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,560
as facial recognition kept rolling and

85
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,159
and by that i mean the news and the

86
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,879
research and and things just kind of

87
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,400
kept going and going we've had the

88
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,640
opportunity to pull out different pieces

89
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,440
of our original like overview of facial

90
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,599
recognition and really get

91
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,200
more into the weeds with the

92
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,879
surveillance side and

93
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,799
what's going on with covid19 and all of

94
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,519
that so we're both really excited to

95
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,120
be here today and i know liz has been

96
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,959
having a little bit of a technical issue

97
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,120
with the platform so

98
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,720
kicking us off um and before we get that

99
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,239
started

100
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,239
let me pull up our slide deck and

101
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,840
we'll get going

102
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,320
so one of the things that we want to

103
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,839
acknowledge

104
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,080
and continue to acknowledge is that we

105
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,120
have a huge

106
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,960
social movement going on right now that

107
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,720
is absolutely critical

108
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,720
both to cyber security and then the us

109
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,000
generally and so

110
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,960
black lives matter and we've kept this

111
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,040
at the forefront of our presentations

112
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,560
because we want you to know that there

113
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,199
are resources that you can access

114
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,280
um if you want to be an ally to the

115
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,400
movement

116
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,120
and when we make the slides available

117
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,720
later you'll be able to hit the notes

118
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,840
section and they're like

119
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,880
organizations that you can donate to

120
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,720
lists of articles that have

121
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,479
recommendation for

122
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,400
anti-racism books or how to have

123
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,400
conversations about race and

124
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
and we just want to encourage people in

125
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,880
the community to be

126
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,720
as i think integrated as you can with

127
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,759
your fellow black americans and

128
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,000
try to bring them up with you and there

129
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,919
are ways to do that and since there are

130
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,520
experts in the field who've

131
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,600
done the research and laid it out all

132
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,720
for you um

133
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,199
we want to make that accessible to you

134
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,960
so

135
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,720
today we're talking about unmasking the

136
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,639
avengers shifting roles of facial

137
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,840
recognition

138
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,039
liz is the chief of staff at scythe um

139
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,720
an information security company that's

140
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,479
based here out of dc

141
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,720
and they are entirely branded by

142
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,120
unicorns which is kind of the fun part

143
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,360
so um if you see them like the unicorn

144
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,120
coloring books and the stickers and

145
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,840
stuff like that

146
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,039
it's uh psych and grim who are

147
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,639
co-branded with this awesome stuff

148
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,840
we are lawyers we are probably unicorns

149
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,440
but we're not your lawyers

150
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,039
and we're definitely not your unicorns

151
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,600
so while we do practice law none of this

152
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,280
uh presentation is meant to be taken

153
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,880
that's legal advice for you

154
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,919
we don't represent you in any way um

155
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,280
and we can't represent you and i think

156
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,520
with that

157
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,680
before we get started let me see if

158
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,840
liz is back

159
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,759
okay all right so

160
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,639
while we wait for liz to hop back in i'm

161
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,000
going to go ahead and get started

162
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,160
on this but hopefully as soon as she's

163
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,240
back she can take over from here

164
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,000
so level setting the current state of

165
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,600
affairs

166
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,319
first things that we saw with um facial

167
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,199
recognition

168
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,000
were your uncovered faces so if you came

169
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,759
back in from a trip

170
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,240
um custom border patrol probably had you

171
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,319
stand in front of like a passport kiosk

172
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,360
and you had to give them a bunch of

173
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,639
documents and then

174
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,800
they took a picture of your face and

175
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,840
it's all serviced by probably some

176
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,479
contractor and

177
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:03,840
we don't really know much about the

178
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,759
security and data privacy and who has

179
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,720
access

180
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,720
um we can probably assume that it's

181
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,280
homeland security and then for cause and

182
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,400
all of that stuff

183
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,560
but all that to say is there's a picture

184
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,919
of your face and every time you go in

185
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,360
and out of the u.s

186
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,520
um you get repeat pictures so i'm

187
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,199
assuming over like a period of five

188
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,199
years if you're a frequent traveler

189
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,080
then over five years dhs will see how

190
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,639
you've changed

191
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,080
the picture in the middle is sort of

192
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,759
like a stylized version

193
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,160
of what a face print would look like and

194
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,840
you can see that it's taking certain

195
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,360
data points

196
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,919
instead of just like a regular picture

197
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:44,879
and

198
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,479
basically what we've seen it used for is

199
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,000
very casual things

200
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,199
um open your phone open your computer

201
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,240
your passport and that's pretty much it

202
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,120
so let's go back to facebook defining an

203
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,680
image

204
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,840
face print so the face print is defined

205
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,840
the data points that are compromised

206
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,759
uh comprised of various measurements of

207
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,599
a person's phase geometry

208
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,440
like the distance between your eyes nose

209
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,280
and ears and compiled into a string that

210
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,960
can be stored and recognized

211
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,000
it's a very specific definition and the

212
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,840
reason that it's that specific is

213
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,039
because

214
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,879
we want to be able to pinpoint the

215
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,720
difference between when someone is just

216
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,919
taking a picture

217
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,520
versus when someone is taking these

218
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,440
types of data points for use later

219
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,719
and so we have facial recognition and

220
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,559
everything that goes with it

221
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:39,839
and then we have facial authentication

222
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,679
what we really want to distinguish here

223
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,360
is

224
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,120
where is the control and where is the

225
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,839
consent so

226
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,320
if i'm personally saying yes to you

227
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,959
using my picture to access a phone

228
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,279
or to access my computer or otherwise

229
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,880
access my data

230
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,760
um i have chosen to do that but then

231
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,000
there's the other piece of it which is

232
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,480
if i'm just existing out in the world

233
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,600
and you're taking

234
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,839
face prints of my face as i go about my

235
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,959
daily business

236
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,959
do i have any control over when it's

237
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,959
captured and what you're doing with it

238
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,760
next

239
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,240
and that's what brings us into the uh

240
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,160
what are commercial uses of face prints

241
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,040
looking like

242
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,839
and what our government uses

243
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,920
just this uh august or july the gao

244
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,880
reported

245
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,680
uh published a report about facial

246
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,600
recognition technology vendors and we've

247
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,279
linked to it in our sources

248
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,320
it's a really great overview of where

249
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,560
facial recognition technology is now

250
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,120
in commercial uses or private uses in

251
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,399
the us

252
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,519
and so what they've noted is that

253
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,720
from 2016 to the global facial

254
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,440
recognition

255
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,080
technology market generated three to

256
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,560
five

257
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,680
billion dollars in revenue which really

258
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,279
leads you to think if you haven't come

259
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,120
across facial recognition in your daily

260
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,240
life already you

261
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,959
probably just aren't aware of it being

262
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:05,680
used

263
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,360
but it is being used because it seems

264
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,279
very ubiquitous

265
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,680
what the gao also predicted is that from

266
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,839
2022 to 2024

267
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,800
the revenue is expected to go from seven

268
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,000
billion dollars

269
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,440
to 10 billion dollars

270
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,120
um the jr report pulled out a list of

271
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,480
all of the patents that have been

272
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,160
granted that are associated with facial

273
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,519
recognition

274
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,000
and as you can see it's gone up and up

275
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,640
and up

276
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,680
every year now while we were at shmukhan

277
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,800
in summer con

278
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,440
we had shown patent applications and

279
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,880
over time there was a dip

280
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,399
in 2018 but it turns out when you just

281
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,000
pull out the ones that have actually

282
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,160
been granted you see just a constant

283
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,240
uptick in different facial recognition

284
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,519
related patterns

285
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,279
and one of the things that the gao made

286
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,519
sure to sort of pull out in their report

287
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,800
was that

288
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,320
even if the application um like even if

289
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,000
the patent was actually granted

290
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,519
it didn't necessarily mean that the

291
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,279
company that applied for it was actually

292
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,800
building anything that was describing

293
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,839
the patent

294
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,079
and this is um typically what we

295
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,200
describe as like

296
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,079
making a war chest exxon used to be

297
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:16,959
really

298
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,880
known for this in which case they would

299
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,959
just file a bunch of patents and that

300
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,320
was their way of just protecting

301
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
potential ip that they perhaps never

302
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,760
really meant to use but could use in

303
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,120
litigation later

304
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,800
so there's a good chance that that is

305
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,560
also what's going on here

306
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,760
but liz what was really significant is

307
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,800
that

308
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,040
facial recognition isn't going anywhere

309
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,000
and that's why

310
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,640
you guys might see uh from mine and

311
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,240
liz's twitter or from

312
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,240
any of the researchers who are working

313
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,600
in the space that

314
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,920
there's a repeated call for making sure

315
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,720
that you can

316
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,839
try to regulate or protect uh consumer

317
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,040
privacy

318
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,760
or enact some security from this

319
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,839
burgeoning facial recognition technology

320
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,519
okay which brings us to the next part

321
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,720
law enforcement

322
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,720
twitter sorry law enforcement uptake of

323
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,240
facial recognition

324
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,200
i'm hoping we get liz back soon because

325
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,160
she

326
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,760
has been a partner of mine in this

327
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,880
for a long time so i don't want to

328
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,560
just do the whole thing by myself

329
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,160
the law enforcement uptake of facial

330
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,000
recognition is something that

331
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,320
is getting into the public awareness

332
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,920
more and more now

333
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,000
and what we wanted to do was focus in on

334
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,320
the amazon ring experience

335
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,279
and here we have a graphic this is from

336
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,320
i think

337
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,480
july of this year july or august of this

338
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,680
year um

339
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,680
it's ring partnerships with various

340
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,200
different pd's

341
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,000
and you can see from the icons that

342
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,720
we've

343
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,279
used here like it's pretty widespread

344
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,519
even just in this small area

345
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,000
and amazon ring has had a lot of

346
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,639
different um

347
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,079
press come about how ring is

348
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,040
you know not really that great or it

349
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,720
sets its bar too low for its

350
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,440
surveillance or it backs up to xyz

351
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,200
and so there are a lot of questions

352
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,519
about how the pds are using their ring

353
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,880
partnerships

354
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,920
similarly now you have the ring

355
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,240
neighbor's public safety service

356
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,000
service which is like an interaction

357
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,760
between the pd and people who've opted

358
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,399
in

359
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,800
to allowing the pd to access their

360
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,880
surveillance from their ring

361
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,560
and one of the interesting things is

362
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,079
that um

363
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,000
callie schroeder who's based out of

364
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,320
colorado and with verisafe

365
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,639
she had once tweeted that you know she

366
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,480
really just wanted a really bright light

367
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,240
or some kind of laser because every time

368
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,760
she was going on her walk down her

369
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,360
street she'd have a lot of

370
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,519
i should see these ring cameras set up

371
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,120
at people's houses because they want to

372
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,800
do like home protection and stuff

373
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,560
but to her it felt like an invasion of

374
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,920
privacy that

375
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,800
anyone could any pd could just be like

376
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,199
hey

377
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,480
uh person will you let me see your

378
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,639
surveillance video and if that neighbor

379
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,560
said yes then you could just

380
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,880
slowly have a pb collecting a bunch of

381
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,800
information about one person over time

382
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,760
taking their

383
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,480
dog on a walk or whatever so it's kind

384
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,040
of a question of what have you consented

385
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,680
to

386
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,519
having surveilled about you by just

387
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,519
being in ex-state

388
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,760
like it used to be a public and a

389
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,279
private difference

390
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,519
but now it feels like even some things

391
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,040
that felt like they were yours and you

392
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,079
could remain anonymous

393
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,639
to an extent are very much identifiable

394
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,279
and trackable

395
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,680
here we have a graphic that's the status

396
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,880
of reported partnerships

397
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,720
photo searches between states and the

398
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,920
fbi uh

399
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,360
facial analysis comparison and

400
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,680
evaluation services

401
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,199
so you can see that there are some

402
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,040
states that are operating off of

403
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,839
just driver's license and id cards uh

404
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:52,880
there are states that are still

405
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,040
negotiating with the fbi

406
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,199
and then there are states where facial

407
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,040
recognition is entirely prohibited

408
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,600
and you'll note that there aren't that

409
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,360
many of them here

410
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,880
um i think it's extremely interesting

411
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,600
that

412
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,800
nebraska and north dakota

413
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,320
and utah which you wouldn't think about

414
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,399
the most highly populated states

415
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,480
are very on board with these imaging and

416
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,040
facial recognition searches

417
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,760
in their states

418
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,839
all right so then came the takers

419
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,720
all of a sudden people have started

420
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,480
posting pictures of themselves with

421
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,360
masks

422
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,199
which makes sense because we're now in

423
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,600
covid19 and if you're responsible

424
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,519
you're wearing masks to protect yourself

425
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,360
and protect other people

426
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,680
um what that means though is that you're

427
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,720
also providing

428
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,920
a lot of data for people to grab and use

429
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,560
to help adjust their algorithms

430
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,839
especially with like the covid19 selfies

431
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:54,880
like this one

432
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,880
so post your mouse selfie for support

433
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,720
this one was all over twitter i believe

434
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,639
it was also all over facebook

435
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,560
and cross posted to instagram so all of

436
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,480
a sudden like you have data sets where

437
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,040
it's

438
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,160
square good lighting and there's a mask

439
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,759
covering someone's face and you can just

440
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,279
pull those and start

441
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,480
going through those to see if your

442
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,399
algorithm actually works on

443
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,920
one-to-one matching or one-to-many

444
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,319
matching

445
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,639
and the question is if you're looking at

446
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,320
facial recognition and you're training

447
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,240
these algorithms on data sets

448
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,320
who actually is holding the data set

449
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,920
standards

450
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,920
and so most recently around may

451
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,600
there was an article about how well can

452
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,079
algorithms recognize your face

453
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,000
initially there were claims at that

454
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,440
point in time that there were companies

455
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,959
who could even with 70

456
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,279
of your face covered with a mask could

457
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,880
figure out who you were from a crowd

458
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,040
which is like one to many matching

459
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,160
and as anil jane

460
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,759
states in this article and we've pulled

461
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,680
out the code for you guys companies can

462
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,360
quote internal numbers but we don't have

463
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,199
a trusted database or evaluation to

464
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,160
check that yet

465
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,199
there's no third party evaluation now

466
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:03,519
the

467
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,119
interesting part of or there's no

468
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,400
third-party validation and the

469
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,679
interesting part of that

470
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,919
is that a lot of people are trying to

471
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,359
position nist

472
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,720
as the standard setter and potentially

473
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,799
use for regulation of facial recognition

474
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,799
by saying okay nist

475
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,319
you should tell us that there's a

476
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,119
certain type of data set

477
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,039
number involved in the data set or

478
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,119
standard that algorithms should be

479
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,080
trained to or should be using and nist

480
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,240
is actually set up as an advisory body

481
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,440
so they're really not

482
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,600
interested in taking up that type of

483
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,039
role um

484
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,720
and this is despite the fact that nist

485
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,559
is involved in setting up security

486
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,240
frameworks and privacy frameworks that

487
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,080
you guys are probably accustomed to

488
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,240
um seeing in the space but they're

489
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,679
they're really not interested in taking

490
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,000
that up in any other capacity

491
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,600
which is why the gao has specifically

492
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,120
called that out in the report that they

493
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,320
released this year

494
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,160
um so we're still looking at the fact

495
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,520
that there's no real third party

496
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,520
validation

497
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,240
interestingly despite the fact that in

498
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,919
may there were people saying that hey

499
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,000
our algorithms can definitely tell who

500
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,039
you are

501
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,960
with full confidence when you have a

502
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,520
mask on because we focus on

503
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,720
the area around the eyes what

504
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,880
um nist found in their most recent

505
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,480
report was when they

506
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,919
tested the algorithms that were

507
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,320
available and had been submitted to nist

508
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,200
before

509
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,640
coven 19 they found that the masks still

510
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,160
increased for all of them

511
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,200
the false non-match rates for one-to-one

512
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,840
testing

513
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,640
so for example if you're coming from

514
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,760
mexico to

515
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,840
texas and you're coming through the

516
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,520
border control

517
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,039
if you were wearing a mask and facial

518
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,720
recognition was being used it was more

519
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,840
likely to say

520
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,240
that a match wasn't there than actually

521
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,080
appropriately predict the match

522
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,200
and this is true for all of the

523
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,440
algorithms that they had submitted

524
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,880
so while there is a lot of um

525
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,960
advertising and marketing in the facial

526
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,720
recognition space saying that hey yeah

527
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,240
we can totally see

528
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,760
who you are what you're doing when you

529
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,919
have a mask uh

530
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,160
it looks like nist hasn't been able to

531
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,640
show that that's true and i'm not

532
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,799
entirely sure if nist is going to run

533
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,960
another study that shows whether

534
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,600
um like companies that focus more on

535
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,520
east asian populations where mass use is

536
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,799
ubiquitous

537
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,400
uh can better and so i'm not sure if a

538
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,200
study like that

539
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,880
is is going to happen or whether those

540
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,080
companies are going to submit their

541
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,320
algorithms

542
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,600
all right all of that aside

543
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,880
is it legal so

544
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,880
ice just signed a contract with

545
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,559
clearview ai

546
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,080
and if you haven't heard about clearview

547
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,720
ai you may be living under a rock

548
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,160
or not based in the us i mean there is

549
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,240
that too so uh

550
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,799
the clearview ai contract that ice just

551
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,679
signed is 224 thousand dollars

552
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,960
and it's it's very vague um

553
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,200
it i don't know what they're doing i

554
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,559
don't know why i signed it

555
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,679
i have a hundred different guesses i

556
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,520
think because clearview had said that it

557
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,760
would stop selling its app to private

558
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,720
companies

559
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,400
and would avoid transacting with

560
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,320
non-governmental customers anywhere so i

561
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,600
guess this is in line with

562
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,799
what they've decided to do

563
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,440
but clearview ai is controversial

564
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,000
because

565
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,720
its founder has associations with white

566
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,080
supremacy

567
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,360
um white supremacist ideology and on top

568
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,440
of that it's facing a number of lawsuits

569
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,720
and investigations

570
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,360
both here in the u.s and across the

571
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,799
world

572
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,799
so uh clearview ai is

573
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,000
very weirdly being used by

574
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,360
government agencies across the us um

575
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,000
for example here we have well i guess

576
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,679
this is canada here we have a detective

577
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,640
constable in the sex

578
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,480
crimes unit for canadian law enforcement

579
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,760
who says it's the

580
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,440
best thing that's happened to victim

581
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,039
identification in the last

582
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,200
10 years because they've made eight

583
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,799
ideas of either victims or offenders

584
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,240
through the new tool

585
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,559
and then also there's the chicago pd

586
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,159
which is using

587
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,360
um the tool to actually look through

588
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,600
unknown suspects to see if it matches a

589
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,880
database of

590
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,720
pictures that have been lifted from

591
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,200
facebook youtube and twitter

592
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,039
which is interesting because the problem

593
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,480
that clearview is running into is that

594
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,840
they grabbed a bunch of pictures that

595
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,919
they really shouldn't have grabbed

596
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,840
and it's unclear what standards they're

597
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,320
using to

598
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,159
actually match the photos so

599
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,360
back to those lawsuits google microsoft

600
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,360
and facebook have sent cease and desist

601
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,320
letters

602
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,240
telling clearview to stop scraping

603
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,039
images from their platforms and services

604
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,559
and then you have the uk ico which is

605
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,760
actually looking into

606
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,320
clearview the office of the australian

607
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,679
information commissioner which is

608
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:52,400
looking into

609
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,440
clearview and also we saw news this

610
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,360
morning that was posted so i guess now

611
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,280
like 30 something hours ago that german

612
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,640
regulators are also looking into

613
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,080
clearview and asking about their data

614
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,280
practices

615
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,679
on top of that there are four class

616
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,360
action lawsuits going on against this

617
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,840
company in illinois california and new

618
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,200
york

619
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,960
all right pending legislation

620
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,039
this is pulled from epic.org state

621
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,039
policy and facial recognition website i

622
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,039
actually highly recommend that if uh

623
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,480
their website and their coverage of

624
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,799
facial recognition if you're interested

625
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:27,840
in this topic

626
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,679
and also at the end of this slide deck

627
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,000
we have a set of resources

628
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,480
that um you can access if you're

629
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,400
interested and there are people who are

630
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,559
very well known in space on the

631
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,320
technical side and also on the legal

632
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,320
side that you can reach out to for

633
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,000
more information or if you're interested

634
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,080
in getting involved in how to stop

635
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,080
the spread of facial recognition or

636
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,360
assist with like fixing algorithmic bias

637
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,559
um all that aside so these are the

638
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,320
pending bills that are coming up in

639
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,120
maryland

640
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,039
there is a facial recognition privacy

641
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,480
protection act

642
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,120
um and that hearing was cancelled there

643
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,640
was a task force to study law

644
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,200
enforcement surveillance technologies

645
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,679
um there are required disclosures and

646
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,240
you can see

647
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,480
just that there are attempts being made

648
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,240
to address this at a state by state

649
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,200
level

650
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,200
and for some of you who are listening

651
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,320
you know

652
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,080
maybe you're wondering why state by

653
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,000
state why not federal

654
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,799
and this brings us to sort of the larger

655
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,400
problem that we have in the united

656
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,600
states is that we're not really

657
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,120
embracing what we call

658
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,280
federal privacy legislation and there's

659
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,559
a big question mark

660
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,280
around whether federal privacy

661
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,360
legislation would actually cover

662
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,480
facial recognition or biometric privacy

663
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,279
which actually brings us back to the gao

664
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,799
report again

665
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,120
fascinatingly the gao report makes the

666
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,720
difference between

667
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,840
facial recognition and facial analysis

668
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,919
so it seems like you can infer that

669
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,520
there's a claim that if a company is

670
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,960
engaging in what they call facial

671
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,240
analysis

672
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,000
they're not necessarily engaging in

673
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,840
facial recognition so maybe facial

674
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,840
recognition laws wouldn't even apply

675
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,600
if you're curious about what your state

676
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,120
is potentially doing to address

677
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,480
facial recognition um i would check out

678
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,159
epic.org and see

679
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,640
what your state is doing as you can see

680
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,720
from the white space that is text-less

681
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,559
it doesn't look like texas is doing much

682
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,880
in that area

683
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,279
all right what i didn't touch on

684
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,559
yet is that a lot of the problems that

685
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,400
people have with facial recognition

686
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,600
algorithms

687
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,760
is that sometimes the algorithms aren't

688
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,799
accurate

689
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:41,360
um an example of that is that out amazon

690
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,640
had released a algorithm that was being

691
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,080
used facial recognition

692
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,120
and it was tested by a non-profit group

693
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,200
on black congress members and what it

694
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,880
did was it identified black congress

695
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,720
members i think almost all of them

696
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,799
as matching potential black criminal

697
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,240
suspects

698
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,480
and so a lot of the problems that you'll

699
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,600
read about are like

700
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,960
hey what about um the fact that the

701
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,840
algorithm

702
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,520
mismatches people and what about the

703
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,440
fact that the algorithm is biased and

704
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,240
that's an important set of questions and

705
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,159
then there's the second important set of

706
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,840
questions which was raised to liz and i

707
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,679
at shmukan which is

708
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,840
what if the algorithms are fine what if

709
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,760
they're super accurate

710
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,240
what if there isn't bias involved then

711
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,080
do we still have a problem with facial

712
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,360
recognition

713
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,159
and honestly the answer is yes because

714
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,080
we still have ethical considerations

715
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,960
about

716
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,880
what we think about privacy what we

717
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,880
think about using facial recognition in

718
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,320
a variety of different contexts

719
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,159
one of the most important things in the

720
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,640
u.s

721
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,159
used to be uh anonymity

722
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,159
because you should be able to express

723
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,919
your opinions about really important

724
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,279
things without people having to

725
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,559
straight to you and this has been

726
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,400
protected by the courts

727
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,559
from pretty early on in history and i'm

728
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,320
i'm losing the quotation off the top of

729
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,120
my head but

730
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,640
there's a great case about the need for

731
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,880
anonymity and i think it was related to

732
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,279
a column that was in a newspaper or

733
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,200
disagreeing with someone's opinion

734
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,960
um anyway we are big fans of anonymity

735
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,919
all of our heroes are masked you can see

736
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:18,720
spider-man

737
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,840
black panther captain america i mean i

738
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,200
mean i know captain america later

739
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,840
anyway anyway

740
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:39,840
no okay

741
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,840
is

742
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,799
because

743
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,959
who are on

744
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,840
um the worst piece of your neighborhood

745
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,360
like the people who are on next door

746
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,360
racist things like hey there's the guy

747
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,279
with the penny my

748
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,360
name is this black guy was taking my

749
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,880
paper buttons and trying to break his

750
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,120
car

751
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,279
surveillance and because it's not

752
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,440
vegetated it's not really working

753
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,080
around it you're starting to build this

754
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,879
like first of all

755
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,000
now not for the philosophy

756
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,120
what we are also worried about is

757
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,200
advancing and this is a phrase i don't

758
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,679
remember

759
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,840
who said it first but i'm really

760
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,679
struggling because when i'm thinking

761
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,200
about terror capitalism

762
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,559
china has actually

763
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,039
found companies fish recommended

764
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,480
about that it looks like we're having

765
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,080
some audio issues

766
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,720
um i don't know where i cut out so

767
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,000
hopefully it was around terror

768
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,520
capitalism which is a really great

769
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,480
phrase

770
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,919
about uh how uyghurs are being treated

771
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,279
in china

772
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,880
and basically this is where facial

773
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,279
recognition is being uh used in

774
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,760
in some of the worst ways and so there's

775
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,399
a small

776
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,039
company in china and i say small it

777
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,480
seems pretty relative i think i'd

778
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,480
consider it mid-size in the us

779
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,240
and what the company is doing is it's

780
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,000
advertising that it can group

781
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,200
up to 70 um

782
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,000
with a 70 effectiveness a group of

783
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,960
people as

784
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,840
uh uyghurs which is a ethnic minority in

785
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,039
china

786
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,440
and that way the chinese state can pick

787
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,799
up the uyghurs

788
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:28,000
and uh deport them to basically

789
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,279
concentration camps or um

790
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,840
have forcible sterilization or

791
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,240
re-education um or

792
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,279
state mandated abortions which is the

793
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,799
current status of uyghurs and if you're

794
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,240
curious more about

795
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,120
what the uyghurs are going through or

796
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,159
what's being

797
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,039
uh inflicted on them the spelling is

798
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:53,440
u-i-g-h-u-r-s

799
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,240
sometimes you'll

800
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,120
it depends on who wrote the article i

801
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,440
think the brits sometimes use ui

802
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,720
um all that to say terror capitalism is

803
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,360
not just

804
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,120
a china thing though it is also

805
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,960
something that's being used outside of

806
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,320
china by

807
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,360
different more autocratic states and

808
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,600
dictatorships to try to identify people

809
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,440
who don't agree with

810
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,880
whatever the party lines are and i think

811
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,120
without some type of emphasis on ethics

812
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,159
and engineers from the ground up

813
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,080
building things knowing how they can be

814
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,919
abused we'll see more and more of this

815
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,600
and sort of partnered with that

816
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,559
is the 30 000 unsuspecting roseville

817
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,320
attendees who are scooped up in a facial

818
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,000
recognition test

819
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,120
so sports stadiums pre-kobit 19

820
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,000
were jumping on this uh bandwagon

821
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,440
because what they wanted to do was make

822
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,399
sure

823
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,360
people could still uh attend these

824
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,200
events without worrying about

825
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,640
um like lone shooters or they wanted to

826
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,240
pick up people who had

827
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,480
um perhaps jump the gates things like

828
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,679
that

829
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,120
and so what they would do is they'd

830
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,200
surveil these huge crowds and that means

831
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,559
that they were getting

832
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,480
a lot of people's faces when they were

833
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,000
coming in through the gates and building

834
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,200
data sets

835
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,399
and so the question is here how many

836
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,080
people knew of it in this case

837
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,360
the people who went to the rose bowl

838
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,279
didn't know about it and the other

839
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,120
question is what happens with that data

840
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,240
set later

841
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,360
and does that data set actually

842
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,279
have an effective algorithm that's being

843
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,559
used on it or

844
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,760
is it just pulling people um

845
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,600
based on like a 30 accuracy

846
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,679
which which isn't a lot but could be a

847
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,360
threshold that it's set up

848
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,640
and even assuming it's all very accurate

849
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,720
and working very well which is the whole

850
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,399
point of this section

851
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,320
do we really want to encourage that kind

852
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,480
of mass surveillance

853
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,480
what if data brokers take that data set

854
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,200
and tie it to other data and sell it to

855
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,320
a giant marketing firm later you know

856
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,919
these are the questions that we still

857
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,039
have that are really

858
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:11,840
hey sushi

859
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,799
such a great job but it's also

860
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:19,760
fascinating to see

861
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,720
how the you know when you talk about the

862
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,760
math surveillance

863
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,480
how that's also getting swept up in the

864
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,320
university

865
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,840
and the contact tracing and some of

866
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,080
those other the multi-uses

867
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,519
and especially when you talk about

868
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,679
clearview ai

869
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,360
and how they've pulled their data sets

870
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,559
not from necessarily

871
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,120
the law enforcement or the typical but

872
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,600
they've

873
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,600
scraped this information from other

874
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,200
places so

875
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,600
so what did ibm amazon and microsoft bit

876
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,840
up to i hear they've had a

877
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,720
boring summer

878
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,600
that's what we like to call it and you

879
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,760
know i think my favorite thing was when

880
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,559
you marked up

881
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,799
microsoft's alleged band of facial

882
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,080
recognition sales

883
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,399
so walk us through it of course because

884
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,320
they you know you see these

885
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,918
platitudes that come out and says we do

886
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,839
not sell our facial recognition

887
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,399
technology to us police departments

888
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:17,280
today

889
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,440
until there is a strong national yeah

890
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,199
blah blah blah blah blah

891
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:25,199
so we hear that and you think okay so

892
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,719
microsoft doesn't and i circled sell

893
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,918
their uh technology to u.s

894
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:35,199
police departments and until you know it

895
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,000
goes through all this different stuff

896
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,359
and when you break that down of course

897
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:42,000
because

898
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,639
you're not actually selling it uh

899
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,239
different companies are the ones

900
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,199
selling it you may not be selling it to

901
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,159
law enforcement

902
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,399
but instead these other companies who

903
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:53,599
are getting that

904
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,239
data are the ones that are entering into

905
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,359
partnerships

906
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:03,839
so next

907
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,680
and so for example ring uh

908
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,560
and in this case they say okay we're not

909
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,520
going to do any

910
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,320
new uh partnerships we're not going to

911
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,320
do any new well

912
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,359
okay but at the same time you've entered

913
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:22,160
into

914
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,320
you know 29 different you they've

915
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,079
already got these in place

916
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,400
and they're already sharing that data

917
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,280
existing

918
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,480
and again it's not that

919
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,000
they're getting you entering into these

920
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,599
contracts and agreements directly it's

921
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:45,839
the third party sharing

922
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,000
so then we get to heroes or red herrings

923
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,800
and liz and i were both looking at this

924
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,960
and all of these companies

925
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,000
had ai ethics board but

926
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,079
to our knowledge amazon microsoft and

927
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,560
google really don't anymore

928
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,480
um and they're claiming that they're not

929
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,599
going to do a number of things with

930
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,040
facial recognition

931
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,359
ibm still has an ethics board or it's in

932
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,599
partnership with an ethics group

933
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:14,079
uh in which they have some leadership

934
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,599
but what we found fascinating was

935
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,359
there are some weird partnerships that

936
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,040
exist outside

937
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,320
for tech innovation and liz i don't know

938
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,359
if you want to talk about it yeah no

939
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,960
it well it gets into well okay you're

940
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,920
not doing this

941
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,040
directly but instead the companies have

942
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,240
started creating these foundations

943
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,359
nonprofits

944
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:41,359
or other side businesses

945
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,880
that looking at this and

946
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,560
identifying and so again it goes back to

947
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,599
well who is the one

948
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,599
creating controlling and scraping and

949
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,200
who is the one selling

950
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,240
and it again goes back to oh great

951
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,760
you're not doing this directly and

952
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,000
yeah you're doing this great job putting

953
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,960
it on hold but

954
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,480
oh wait it's because you secretly

955
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,680
uh or behind the scenes created these

956
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,480
foundations that are the ones instead

957
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:22,240
doing it

958
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,520
and so one of the things is that

959
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,040
there are a lot of names that we won't

960
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,560
recognize um

961
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,760
because you don't see them in the news

962
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,839
in the u.s but they're actually

963
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:35,359
used a lot in the u.s and liz i think

964
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:36,400
there was something you found

965
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,440
specifically

966
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,160
really interesting about the nec and

967
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,119
that's what you've done

968
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,960
so with any japanese company and

969
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,000
they have created their

970
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,359
their system since you hear these

971
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,200
companies like okay google

972
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,839
amazon everyone else saying no well it's

973
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:54,640
because

974
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,040
it's the companies like nec that are

975
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,160
actually doing it

976
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,000
and and this case they have over a third

977
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,320
at the time like from their own

978
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,440
disclosures

979
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,800
they are working with and in

980
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,240
partnerships with over a third of the

981
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:08,960
u.s

982
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,320
state police and law enforcement

983
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,720
agencies in addition

984
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,040
this is also one of the companies that's

985
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,839
doing

986
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,119
a significant portion of the biometric

987
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,200
facial recognition technology

988
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,480
for airports around the world uh and the

989
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,000
airlines and so keeping in mind when you

990
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,200
say airports we're talking about the

991
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,160
airlines

992
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,599
as well as you have to look at

993
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,640
the tsa and all those others

994
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,839
but it's one company that's ending up

995
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:38,880
with a lot of these

996
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,119
contracts it's not just clearview and

997
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,520
you again you'll notice these are not

998
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,800
it's a private company

999
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,960
not the law enforcement route directly

1000
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,839
collecting

1001
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,960
so it gets it outside of some of the in

1002
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,520
the us

1003
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,240
constitutional protections when you when

1004
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:01,280
you move it to that private company

1005
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,280
yeah and you know i kind of want to know

1006
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,520
what's going on in ohio don't you liz

1007
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,480
like we've got all colors on ohio

1008
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,520
federal

1009
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,720
facial recognition cch

1010
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,800
and then of course dhs has some iris

1011
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,400
scanning but

1012
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,160
it's a little odd like a hodgepodge of

1013
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,240
what's going on in ohio guys

1014
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,640
my question is well you have to move it

1015
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,560
out of illinois because illinois and

1016
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,160
bipa

1017
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,160
class actions are going between illinois

1018
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,200
new york and

1019
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,960
california that's right that's right and

1020
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,480
actually liz maybe it'll be helpful

1021
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,079
if you want to talk about the biometric

1022
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:37,920
privacy act briefly

1023
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,440
i think it's the only one we have right

1024
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,400
well california has

1025
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,200
brought in their own as well as some of

1026
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,040
the states like maryland

1027
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,560
have tried to tie in the biometric

1028
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,320
uh to their existing but that's why you

1029
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,440
see with illinois all the class action

1030
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,640
lawsuits for example macy's just had

1031
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,319
a new one filed last month

1032
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:07,680
a class action in illinois

1033
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,319
that macy's was using the facial

1034
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:11,440
recognition

1035
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,760
technology and not telling so with

1036
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,960
illinois

1037
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,520
it's you have to tell people that you're

1038
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,640
using it tell people that you're

1039
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,599
collecting it

1040
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,800
tell them why and how long provide those

1041
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,200
details and macy's wasn't doing that

1042
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,800
so we're going to see how that one plays

1043
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,359
out as well

1044
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,560
yeah yep it's going to be fascinating

1045
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,319
and i was just telling our

1046
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,800
audience here that we really aren't

1047
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,560
expecting a federal privacy

1048
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,400
regulations and and we're going to keep

1049
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,319
seeing these state-by-state moves

1050
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:46,720
so um all right so we got rid of ibm

1051
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,880
and google and microsoft and they all

1052
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,280
said we don't want to be a part of this

1053
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,319
allegedly and who's left

1054
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:57,599
exactly well it is the people who have

1055
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,640
actually been scraping and

1056
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,680
collecting so clear view gets

1057
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,880
a lot of attention is another one

1058
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,079
as well as nec and

1059
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,440
do we have uh

1060
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,560
let's say talking about

1061
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,280
uh but also talking about with the clear

1062
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,079
view

1063
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,760
and where they've really

1064
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,800
stepped into the forefront of

1065
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,480
a lot of the lawsuits and

1066
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,240
a lot of the class actions where you

1067
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,960
have even private companies saying hey

1068
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,800
clearview stop doing this stop doing

1069
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,280
this

1070
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,440
yet on the flip side clear view and i

1071
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,960
know you talked about

1072
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,160
the recent uh customs

1073
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,200
or ice contract so you

1074
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,520
have all these different companies that

1075
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,240
are doing it

1076
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,280
outside of the government regulations

1077
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,520
in the sense of their private

1078
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,520
individuals scraping

1079
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:02,960
and they don't have the ethics boards

1080
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,400
right and so this brings us to our

1081
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,920
takeaways

1082
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,119
what is happening in the facial

1083
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,960
recognition space

1084
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,800
well as you noted uh there's the lack of

1085
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,440
guidance

1086
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,040
uh the us government's just trying to

1087
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,800
keep up with the gao report

1088
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,160
saying hey there more needs to be done

1089
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,599
nist is trying to create the standards

1090
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,440
uh but again with such a low bar and

1091
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,720
it you there's just chaos

1092
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,000
and with that the

1093
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,880
challenge becomes to be to be vigilant

1094
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,520
and

1095
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,640
as you're in the technology field in

1096
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,720
information security and the companies

1097
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,240
you're working for the research that

1098
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,000
you're working on

1099
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,720
and holding the lawmakers as well

1100
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,480
accountable saying hey

1101
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,440
what is happening to my data and are we

1102
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,119
building the algorithms and are we

1103
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,240
overseeing this

1104
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,640
in such a manner that it's helpful and

1105
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,160
there's no walking it back

1106
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,520
you know with the genie is out of the

1107
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,440
bottle and it

1108
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,839
there are benefits to the

1109
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:14,000
technology it's okay now how do we

1110
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,200
can not contain it but how do we frame

1111
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:17,520
it

1112
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,880
how do we put in the training wheels

1113
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,160
that we need to keep it moving forward

1114
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,440
but in a manner that respects our

1115
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,800
data and our privacy

1116
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,760
yeah and if you want to know more about

1117
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,280
what you can do from the engineering

1118
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:35,839
side

1119
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:38,079
um i know our schmuck on talk focused

1120
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:39,520
pretty much on that

1121
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,520
and have resources for engineers to

1122
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,960
associate with professional ethics

1123
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,560
organizations that were started by other

1124
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,599
engineers

1125
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,520
um so definitely feel free to just grab

1126
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,119
that off of youtube and

1127
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,480
and use that and what we'd also like to

1128
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,000
point you guys to before we come back to

1129
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,599
questions and complaints

1130
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,920
is we have a pretty extensive resources

1131
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,520
section so you can click on some of

1132
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,280
these links and go explore the articles

1133
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,400
yourselves

1134
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,480
um and the reports yourselves like i

1135
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,079
really recommend diving into this if

1136
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:07,440
you're interested

1137
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,680
and there's a lot more to explore we

1138
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,839
have facial recognition and longitudinal

1139
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:13,359
data over time

1140
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,640
um creeping use cases for non-facial

1141
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,319
recognition biometric technology

1142
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:21,760
and especially as we're all

1143
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,079
obviously virtual um and some of the

1144
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,000
technology that's being used

1145
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,319
in if you're interviewing and you're

1146
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:29,200
interviewing

1147
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,839
via you know camera is the camera

1148
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:32,319
tracking

1149
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:35,440
the ar vr you know

1150
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,680
with those headsets how is that

1151
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,599
information being used

1152
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,040
and how you kind of again reigning it in

1153
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,359
and making sure that if this is the

1154
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:46,240
intended

1155
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,079
but yes a deeper dive there and then

1156
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,000
also we'll share our slides

1157
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,680
and in the notes section of each of the

1158
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,319
slides and we also tried to provide

1159
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:55,359
additional links

1160
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,280
so that you can find the information

1161
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,680
yourself

1162
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,359
yep and liz and i also work together to

1163
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,000
grab people

1164
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,560
that we would definitely uh recommend

1165
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,319
following or reaching out to if you're

1166
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:09,760
still interested in facial recognition

1167
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,560
in biometrics um all of these people are

1168
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,400
really at the forefront of their fields

1169
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,160
and incredibly helpful and you know neck

1170
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,040
deep in research

1171
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,079
yeah so i think

1172
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:23,839
i think you guys said you missed the

1173
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,560
audio on

1174
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,400
this side perhaps

1175
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,319
and liz i don't know if you want to go

1176
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:32,770
ahead and

1177
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:34,800
[Laughter]

1178
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,240
well really some of the issues that

1179
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,359
come up when we talk about the

1180
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:44,480
ring and next door and all this

1181
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,440
that the biometric data the information

1182
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,599
the facial recognition

1183
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,160
understanding that and highlighting how

1184
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,200
flawed it is

1185
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,319
what happens when you have a police

1186
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:56,880
department

1187
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,079
that puts out an alert and says okay

1188
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,800
here's who we're looking for people get

1189
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,920
it wrong

1190
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,440
and if you know the twitter sleuths

1191
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,200
come in and say oh i think it's this

1192
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,800
person i think it's that person

1193
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,319
you end up doxing the wrong people

1194
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:17,839
and the kind of the triple trickle-down

1195
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:21,520
effect but it goes to highlight

1196
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,079
and sushi's also making fun of me by

1197
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:25,839
asking me to share about this slide in

1198
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:26,880
particular

1199
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,960
because uh when i walk my dog at night

1200
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,240
i tend to notice the number of neighbors

1201
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,119
who have

1202
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:37,280
ring and i put you know give a little

1203
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,400
dance i

1204
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,079
i make sure that they are getting their

1205
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:41,440
money's worth

1206
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,079
out of that surveillance state that

1207
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,200
they've created

1208
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,200
that law enforcement are going back

1209
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,640
asking a lot of people don't know you

1210
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,839
can opt out

1211
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:51,359
but where is that information being

1212
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:52,960
shared and what is the harm

1213
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,000
that comes from it especially when you

1214
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,640
get it wrong

1215
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:04,000
and i think that's it from us and we'll

1216
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,079
open up for q a

1217
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:10,480
hi there i'm back

1218
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,960
all right we are opening up for a q a

1219
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:13,920
den uh

1220
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,079
if anyone in the chat has any questions

1221
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,839
please let us know

1222
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:21,280
uh all right we have our first

1223
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,760
what can non-engineers do to help

1224
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,599
protect themselves

1225
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:28,640
or rather how can i educate my family

1226
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,880
members on safer practices

1227
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,359
regarding using social media to help

1228
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:36,839
avoid contributing to facial recognition

1229
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:39,839
databases

1230
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,760
that is a pretty big question

1231
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,160
[Laughter]

1232
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,520
um and

1233
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,400
keeping in mind i mean some of it the

1234
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,559
your family members don't have

1235
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:55,920
um if you use social media it's being

1236
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:56,720
scraped

1237
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,920
and if you're you know in

1238
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,480
and even beyond that and what we've

1239
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,440
tried to highlight is

1240
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,760
even just by having a driver's license

1241
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,800
uh

1242
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,280
you're getting scraped in as well uh

1243
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,160
that

1244
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,000
states and stuff have done that to that

1245
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,839
end though educating and letting people

1246
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:19,359
know that hey this is

1247
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,040
you know this is how some of this is

1248
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,559
being used this is

1249
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:25,839
be aware when you're doing that but also

1250
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:29,040
same question what

1251
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,520
you push back push back against the

1252
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,480
macy's

1253
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,480
the ask your uh state

1254
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,559
and local legislators if the federal

1255
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,480
folks can't get it right

1256
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,559
you do have those avenues some of the

1257
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,160
cities especially

1258
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,359
uh california you have different uh

1259
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,960
municipalities breaking out and saying

1260
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,440
hey we're going to put some restrictions

1261
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,119
on how this is getting used

1262
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:56,240
have those conversations

1263
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,640
yeah i think echoing everything liz said

1264
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,079
and then also we have

1265
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:05,520
um you know people with children

1266
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,599
should know that it's not the best idea

1267
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:09,440
to post pictures of your babies and your

1268
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,880
baby pictures

1269
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,640
as they go on go through life like

1270
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,400
online because also maybe they don't

1271
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,920
want to have that information out there

1272
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,280
and you don't want it to be part of the

1273
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,160
fr

1274
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,760
databases the data sets and then

1275
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,440
write to your congress person which

1276
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,760
sounds like the lamest thing i could say

1277
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,839
but it's also the most effective thing

1278
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,440
because if there's no federal privacy

1279
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,000
legislation

1280
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,319
for biometrics the most you can do or at

1281
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:34,240
least you can do is say hey state

1282
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,920
uh i really want you to pass some

1283
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,760
legislation so

1284
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,760
people aren't creeping me out just when

1285
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,440
i'm using the internet

1286
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,000
and i just tag suchi in all my pictures

1287
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:44,480
uh

1288
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,319
so that it really messes up some of the

1289
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:47,520
algorithms

1290
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:52,079
and especially my nieces and nephews

1291
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,680
we've got another one uh we have

1292
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,160
just a few minutes more so i guess this

1293
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:58,720
is going to be

1294
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,680
also our last one what would be the

1295
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,880
potential

1296
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,680
repercussions to affirm storing facial

1297
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,359
biometrics if they were

1298
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:11,359
breached oh

1299
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:14,720
hmm clear view ai uh

1300
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,359
luckily their most recent breach was

1301
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:18,000
only

1302
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,359
uh doing it but it's happened and

1303
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:24,640
and keeping in mind

1304
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,760
repercussions only work if

1305
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,559
enforcing it for example when you have

1306
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:31,119
nec

1307
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:33,839
and anedemia and they're located outside

1308
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:34,800
the us

1309
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,160
uh great okay uh

1310
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,359
the u.s is you know strenuously

1311
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:42,720
objecting

1312
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,680
and what else are you gonna do you know

1313
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,200
how do you enforce when the

1314
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:52,078
companies are like i mean were worldwide

1315
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:55,119
all right and those jobs for everybody i

1316
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:56,880
