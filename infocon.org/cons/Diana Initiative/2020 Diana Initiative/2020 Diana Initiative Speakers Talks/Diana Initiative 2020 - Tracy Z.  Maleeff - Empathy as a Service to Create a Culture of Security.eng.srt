1
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,960
good morning everyone

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,840
so i just wanted to take some time to

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,880
welcome you all

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,680
before we kick this off with our keynote

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,640
uh this year

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,960
our slogan is breaking boundaries bite

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,920
by bite

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,400
so as you enjoy the event please keep in

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,599
mind the different ways that

10
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,760
representation in cyber security

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,040
whether it's gender sexuality skill

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,079
level

13
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,120
red blue or purple team affiliation

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,920
can help protect data today and in the

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,440
future

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,600
we're really sad that this is online and

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,360
we're not all in vegas

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,120
on the other hand none of us had to

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,120
actually pay all that money for the

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,320
hotel and flights

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,520
so i guess there is a silver lining

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,600
we found hoppin and we are hoping that

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,520
this enables us to have a friendly

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,239
and calm environment where we can still

25
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,159
have those hallway conversations

26
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,400
and random meetups throughout the event

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,720
you can click on the networking tab

28
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,640
to get randomly paired with other people

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,040
and if there's no one there it will just

30
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,080
sit there so don't

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,600
be worried you can always come back in

32
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,360
later and

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,000
also anyone can create a session so if

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,360
you decide you want to have

35
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,759
a group talking about dfir feel free to

36
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,439
go in and create a session

37
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,119
and have your own little unconference

38
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,520
session

39
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,240
we also have an information booth if you

40
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:34,640
have

41
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,040
questions go ahead click on sessions and

42
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,720
head over into the information booth and

43
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,960
they will try to find you the answer

44
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,200
if you have any safety concerns during

45
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,479

you can report an issue

50
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,960
and they'll address it we hope that

51
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,640
there are none but it is there if you

52
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,719
need it

53
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,479

women and non-binary folks in

113
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,919
information security and that's a great

114
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,960
thing diversity of thought solves

115
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,280
problems events like this couldn't

116
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,560
happen without the support of

117
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,600
allies so welcome to everyone today i'd

118

120
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,560
your personal

121
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,479
and professional development and that

122
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,160
deserves praise

123
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,759
for some of you this event may be

124
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,520
outside your comfort zone and you are to

125
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,400
be commended

126
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,800
for taking the step to be here so

127
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,560
welcome to everyone

128
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,080
let's begin my talk today about the

129
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,080
concept of empathy as a service

130
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,840
to create a culture of security

131
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,120
but first have a disclaimer first

132
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,199
a disclaimer and then and such

133
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,960
disclaimer is thoughts and opinions

134
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,639
expressed are mine in my own and not

135
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,240
that of my employer

136
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,759
in other words if you take issue with

137
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,440
something that i say please take it up

138
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,400
with me

139
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,080
if we were in person i would encourage

140
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,600
that you buy me a gin and tonic at the

141
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:15,919
bar

142
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,160
afterwards uh for now just send me a

143
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,360
note if you have something that you

144
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,639
disagree with and i'll be happy to

145
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,400
discuss it with you

146
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,680
and then my n such is uh what i'm about

147
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,639
to present to you

148
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,560
is a structure of thought from library

149
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,039
science i will show you how it can be

150
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,919
transferred into information security

151
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,520
i know that to some of you that seems

152
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,440
like a far-fetched idea

153
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,199
the things that i cover in my talk may

154
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,120
not apply to everyone

155
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,960
but i just ask that you listen with an

156
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,360
open mind and apply what you can to your

157
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,639
situation

158
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:53,520
thank you let's begin

159
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,360
there are people who believe that i have

160
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,720
no business being an

161
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,400
information security job why is that

162
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,520
because on paper i am a woman

163
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,479
of a certain age with a liberal arts and

164
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,800
library science education

165
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,840
and no real tech experience that's how i

166
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,680
look on paper

167
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,000
but if you look deeper you'd understand

168
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,160
how i bring with me transferable skills

169
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,840
in a different point of view very much

170
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,319
needed in this field

171
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,720
but on paper i look like what someone

172
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
once said to me at defcon

173
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,240
that i look like i was searching for the

174
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,960
tupperware convention and got lost

175
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,479
yeah that really happened

176
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,120
but this talk isn't about me it's about

177
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,960
my wish for the information security

178
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,039
industry and community to utilize

179
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,360
empathy more often when dealing with end

180
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,400
users

181
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,880
colleagues and anyone else you deal with

182
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,880
professionally when it involves security

183
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,639
considering how someone looks on paper

184
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,400
is a very short-sighted view of how they

185
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,919
really are

186
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,599
using the seven-step principle from

187
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,199
library science called the reference

188
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,400
interview

189
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,919
i'm going to show you how to be more

190
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,479
considerate and conscious of people

191
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,560
and how these steps can can turn them

192
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,039
into security advocates

193
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,000
look beyond the superficial people are

194
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,840
not paper

195
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,919
before we go any further i'd like to

196
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,800
quickly clarify a definition of empathy

197
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,560
empathy is not sympathy i'm not asking

198
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,199
you to feel

199
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,919
sorry for your end users i'm asking that

200
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,440
you imagine what it must be like in

201
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,720
their shoes

202
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,160
how security looks from their

203
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,000
perspective

204
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,840
for many people the idea of a password

205
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,919
manager or identifying a phishing email

206
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,840
is a scary thing

207
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,720
this does not make them stupid therefore

208
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,000
do not belittle them

209
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,199
over their lack of knowledge

210
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,360
theodore roosevelt said no one cares how

211
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,280
much you know

212
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,000
until they know how much you care it

213
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,919
doesn't matter if you are the leadest of

214
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,319
all the elite hackers in the land

215
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,919
if you don't demonstrate some empathy

216
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,080
and compassion while dealing with people

217
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,879
that knowledge means nothing in other

218
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:09,680
words

219
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,840
don't put people down for not being tech

220
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,919
or security savvy just to make yourself

221
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,520
feel more important

222
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,440
that is a garbage attitude to have and

223
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,319
you're better than that

224
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,240
so what are the steps of the reference

225
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,000
interview you can see them here

226
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,240
on the screen i will go through each one

227
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,319
and explains how it relates to security

228
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,000
and how you can implement it in your own

229
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,479
world remember when i'm talking about

230
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,880
empathy as a service i mean this not

231
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,320
just for end users but for your

232
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,039
colleagues

233
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,479
whether that means other departments

234
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,240
within your company or other

235
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,880
professionals outside your company

236
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,360
it's also just great to use empathy as a

237
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,720
service for these newcomers to the

238
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,959
industry who want to learn

239
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,560
this is a great guideline of how to

240
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,720
trouble shoot the core of security

241
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,560
humans

242
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,080
so you know there's one thing that

243
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,000
brings all these steps together

244
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,120
there we have approachability interest

245
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,399
listening interviewing searching

246
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,720
answering follow-up what's the one thing

247
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,839
that brings them all together

248
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,440
no gatekeeping empathy as a service is a

249
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,040
no gatekeeping zone

250
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,560
that's another garbage attitude that

251
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,360
needs to go away

252
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,720
let's get started on these reference

253
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,680
interview steps starting with

254
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,320
approachability

255
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,519
one of the things that made a strong

256
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,279
impression on me when i first started in

257
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,959
information security

258
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,800
was the collective disdain and contempt

259
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,480
for end users that i heard

260
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,000
from many in the industry in the

261
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,680
community

262
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,040
whether you want to believe it or not

263
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,959
many parts of security are essentially

264
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,200
customer service jobs

265
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,959
now i don't mean that as a derogatory

266
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,120
statement it's the truth

267
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,480
security is human-centric humans are the

268
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,000
asset that we need to protect

269
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,880
so approachability

270
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,079
one of the factors of it is reputation

271
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,600
how do your end users and fellow

272
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,000
professionals view you are you the angry

273
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,680
security person

274
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,360
are you the helpful person that people

275
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,680
feel comfortable reaching out to

276
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,279
now this just isn't limited to

277
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,920
individuals how is your security team

278
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,399
regarded within your organization

279
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,240
do they think you are the scary trolls

280
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,640
who boom none shall pass

281
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,560
if you're unsure how your security team

282
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,120
is regarded you may want to ask around

283
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,040
or even have a survey

284
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,440
i know that sounds basic but if you

285
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,200
really cannot gauge how the security

286
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,240
team is regarded

287
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,880
you need to find out if the results are

288
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,760
unfavorable

289
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,320
well then you need to start there you

290
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,600
need to start repairing a bad reputation

291
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,720
one way to repair that reputation

292
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,560
and to judge your approachability is

293
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,959
your contact ability

294
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,440
do your end users easily know how to

295
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,040
contact you

296
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,720
what do your outgoing voicemail and

297
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,120
email messages say to them

298
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,600
what's the tone of voice in your in your

299
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,079
speech or in your writing

300
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,920
does your security area have a phone

301
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,440
number a slack channel

302
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,399
messaging apps how can people contact

303
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,600
you

304
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
when i first started at my sock job

305
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,360
there was a woman who was surprised to

306
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,360
learn that there were actually humans

307
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,320
in security and i was confused and i

308
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,279
asked her what she meant

309
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,040
she said oh i thought everything was

310
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,320
just automated

311
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,760
by computers i didn't think there was

312
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,399
actually humans working there and i i

313
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,279
turned to my boss and i said don't you

314
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:35,760
ever do

315
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,920
outreach to the the end users and i just

316
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,800
kind of got a shrug

317
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,480
know that there's people on the other

318
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,560
end in security

319
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,720
and know make sure that they know how to

320
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,959
that your users know how to contact you

321
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,040
you we're all humans make sure that they

322
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,160
know how to be contacted

323
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,560
and another part of of being contacted

324
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,439
is communication

325
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,519
this may not apply to everyone but i

326
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,360
worked for a multinational global

327
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,000
company

328
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,720
for this in the soc and we had users who

329
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,639
did not speak english as their primary

330
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,000
language

331
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,240
if you have users in your organization

332
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,320
who may not be strong in english do you

333
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,880
have accommodations for them

334
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,639
so an example of this is we would

335
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,560
receive emails

336
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,079
in another language which i would

337
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,000
translate and i would respond to them

338
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,519
using the translator

339
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,200
which my co-workers got mad about

340
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,560
because one said to me now they're gonna

341
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,079
expect all of us to do that

342
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,880
well we should it's our job to get back

343
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,800
to them

344
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,959
have you noticed that maybe the fishing

345
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,800
fails in your company in the south

346
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,240
american offices

347
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,880
are higher than other regions do you

348
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,480
have educational materials

349
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,880
in spanish and portuguese for them or

350
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,240
are you expecting them to learn about

351
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,120
security

352
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,480
by reading another language

353
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,200
i have a couple of these story time

354
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,560
slides in here so let me tell you my

355
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,839
first story

356
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,040
so that says in english that says uh

357
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,639
don't speak english it's italian for

358
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,160
don't speak english

359
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,240
so story time it was late in the day

360
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,079
i was about ready to go home working in

361
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,320
the sock an alert went off that there

362
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,839
was some malicious documents being

363
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,200
downloaded

364
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,079
did my investigation and realized that

365
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,040
it was

366
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,079
a laptop in one of the offices in italy

367
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,079
and given the time difference i realized

368
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,519
it was about midnight or one in the

369
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,240
morning

370
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,920
so immediately i'm thinking oh this is

371
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,320
not good what is going on here

372
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,440
i was able to quickly deduce that it was

373
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,200
a security guard so probably an

374
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,880
overnight security guard was

375
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,440
bored probably downloading things so

376
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,279
through the messaging app that we had at

377
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,880
the company i was able to see that he

378
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,480
was online

379
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,959
so in english just not really thinking i

380
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,160
sent a message

381
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,800
and i could see the read receipt and

382
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,880
then but nothing there was silence

383
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,240
and i'm getting more and more concerned

384
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,920
about whatever's being downloaded

385
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,519
and i'm you know thinking all the worst

386
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,160
thoughts and then it occurred to me

387
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,639
this person might not speak english so

388
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,720
went to an online translator

389
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,440
the figured out what i wanted to say put

390
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,639
it in the chat box

391
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,040
the very first sentence i used was i am

392
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,519
using an online translator please excuse

393
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,519
any grammatical errors

394
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,440
i recommend this whenever you're using

395
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,519
an online translator to communicate

396
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,279
because we know that they're not 100

397
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,440
accurate and rather than someone getting

398
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,120
this disjointed message that seems

399
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,320
strange

400
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,920
just give them the courtesy of a warning

401
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,920
hey i don't speak your language

402
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,399
i'm using this tool to help me so just

403
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,079
keep that in mind

404
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,760
after i posted what i wanted to say in

405
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,600
italian he wrote back immediately

406
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,279
in italian bingo i hit on it

407
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,279
then i translated what he said and then

408
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,760
through that exchange of translating

409
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,440
i was able to get him to stop

410
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,760
downloading i was able to

411
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,079
initiate a virus scan of his computer

412
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,279
and get him to understand the situation

413
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,040
and that's all it was he just needed to

414
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,880
be told to stop but in a language that

415
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,399
he could understand

416
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,120
so i took an extra step to be heard

417
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,079
because it was this

418
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,800
person that needed to be protected and i

419
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,839
was speaking literally speaking their

420
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,839
language

421
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,720
another way for approachability is

422
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,800
feeling seen now this is usually a term

423
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,480
used in a negative way i want you to

424
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,279
embrace this as a positive thing

425
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,240
get out inside your company you know

426
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,440
what i mean by this

427
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,160
network with people internally i want

428
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,519
you to adopt what

429
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,440
has been known call has been known as an

430
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,440
entrepreneurial spirit

431
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,600
that's the essence of an entrepreneur

432
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,160
but with inside your organization

433
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,160
market your security department market

434
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,279
yourself

435
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,199
develop what's called an elevator pitch

436
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,040
anything from one to five sentences

437
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,399
about what you do

438
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,079
what the security team does what the

439
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,079
security can team can do for your end

440
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,240
users and other departments

441
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,560
maybe even talk to your marketing folks

442
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,320
on some strategies of how you can better

443
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,040
promote

444
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,440
what the security team does this is

445
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,040
where metrics come in

446
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,000
maybe have some metrics that you can

447
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,120
without

448
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,079
having any upset issues sharing them to

449
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,160
tell people what you do

450
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,839
for a lot of people the security team's

451
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,199
a mystery

452
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,720
so help them understand what you do and

453
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,279
what you can do for them

454
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,839
at my old company the marketing team

455
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,160
decided to create these coffee mugs

456
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,079
that said something along the lines of

457
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,600
by the time you finished drinking this

458
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,160
cup of coffee we will have defended

459
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,720
10 000 cyber incidents or something like

460
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,199
that

461
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,639
now we had a good laugh about it because

462
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,920
we don't know where they got that number

463
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,240
from

464
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,959
but i appreciated the sentiment it was a

465
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,639
way to get the information out

466
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,440
to the company in a fun way to show what

467
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,160
the security team did

468
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,399
the end goal of approachability is that

469
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,920
you want people to be thinking of the

470
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,199
security team when

471
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,240
issues come up being approachable will

472
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,480
will help remind them of that so if that

473
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,000
means joining a book club

474
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,720
or a softball team or just going to

475
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,480
events and introducing yourself just

476
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,119
hi i'm tracy from security that puts a

477
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,119
name and a face to security

478
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,400
for something that a lot of people

479
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,119
thought was just an automated machine

480
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,119
you know and a blinky block somewhere in

481
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,959
a in a back room

482
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,839
put a name and a face to security

483
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,160
the next step is interest

484
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,359
now this one i have a hard time

485
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,119
describing because essentially i boil

486
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,319
this down to

487
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,480
this is just doing your job you need to

488
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,840
be interested in what people are

489
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,960
bringing to you

490
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,799
be interested in solving the problem at

491
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,960
hand what i like to

492
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,960
stress to people is don't play hot

493
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,520
potato if you're familiar with that

494
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,919
you know someone lands the pro you know

495
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,360
you have a problem that lands in your

496
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,320
situation

497
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,760
and you're real quick to get rid of it

498
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,360
you know not my job

499
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,400
not my department not my issue

500
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,400
another way to avoid this is stop doing

501
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,559
what i call blind transfers or blind

502
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,559
handovers and let me explain

503
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,320
have you ever called a customer service

504
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,240
line and maybe you didn't reach the

505
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,679
right department

506
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,039
and they need to transfer you someone

507
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,880
else that's really frustrating right

508
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,360
well what do good places do good places

509
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,520
will call the correct department

510
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,720
get a new agent on the phone and either

511
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,240
have you on the phone while you hear

512
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,000
them explain the situation and do the

513
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,280
handover

514
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,200
or you'll be muted and then they'll

515
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,640
they'll put you over

516
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,640
don't just throw a problem at someone

517
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,000
and don't just get rid of it because

518
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,919
that makes the user feel really bad that

519
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,039
you don't care that you're not

520
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:29,919
interested

521
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,520
in solving their security problem and

522
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,280
then they're wondering why did i even

523
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,640
contact security

524
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,960
in the first place you want to make your

525
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,720
interaction with an end user a safe

526
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,280
split

527
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,559
a safe place meaning don't belittle them

528
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,039
don't mock them don't be condescending

529
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,919
be interested in the situation at hand

530
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,200
this is also just a good thing to

531
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,799
practice with your fellow professionals

532
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,559
and your fellow departments

533
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,080
you know if somebody contacts you and

534
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,080
it's really a help desk issue

535
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,520
don't just throw your hands up and say

536
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,160
oh not my problem it's the help desk

537
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,840
explain to the user oh you know you've

538
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,520
reached security but i think you really

539
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,400
want

540
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,640
the help desk may i send you over there

541
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,480
let them know what's going on keep them

542
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,840
informed be interested

543
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,400
so here's an example of how you can show

544
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,720
interest through written communication

545
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,160
and i cannot stress this enough if

546
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,400
you're using written communication

547
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,200
you are not e cummings you use sentence

548
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,840
case

549
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,559
use punctuation i want to give you an

550
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,640
example of a letter here

551
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,440
that is very brief but conveys a lot of

552
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,480
information

553
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,880
that again shows your interest in the

554
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,000
user's problem

555
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,400
so first you need to have a salutation

556
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,320
in this case we have dear robert

557
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,120
it could be hi susan it could be hello

558
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,400
rajiv

559
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
however you want to do a salutation

560
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,320
let's look at the body of the message

561
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,280
i have two sentences that convey four

562
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,360
very important pieces of information

563
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,520
let's look at the first sentence thank

564
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,520
you for contacting the security team

565
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,000
about the phishing email you received

566
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,880
two pieces of information you thank them

567
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,159
and you tell that you were

568
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,159
you reiterate what they contacted you

569
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,960
about why do you thank the end user

570
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,080
because they didn't have to contact you

571
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,320
they didn't have to go out of their way

572
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,159
to send you a phishing email

573
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,760
or another problem that you're dealing

574
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,159
with so you thank them for contacting

575
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:24,960
you

576
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,720
and then you re reiterate why they

577
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,799
contacted you so that it's not just a

578
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,679
generic hey thanks for email

579
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,520
why did you contact them the phishing

580
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,880
email i'm going to tell you why you

581
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,559
contacted me you contacted me about that

582
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,840
phishing email

583
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,480
second sentence we will investigate and

584
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,400
get back to you within a business day

585
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,880
two pieces of information your action

586
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,679
what you're going to do

587
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,840
investigate and a reasonable amount of

588
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,280
time to get back to them

589
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,280
so again the person receiving this

590
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,960
message knows what you're going to do

591
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,679
with it

592
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,000
and when to expect a time that you'll

593
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,200
they'll hear back from you

594
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,240
so two sentences four very important

595
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,559
information that the person knows that

596
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,159
you are interested in their problem

597
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,640
and they know what's going on so then

598
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,240
you'll want a complimentary close you

599
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,320
can use best regards sincerely

600
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,039
cheers and then most of us have

601
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,120
signature files in our email

602
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,039
but make sure that when you sign off on

603
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,159
it put your name put your title

604
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,760
again you want to make sure that people

605
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,159
know there's a human behind this email

606
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,159
who are you and you know what's your

607
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,000
responsibility are you a manager are you

608
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,320
an analyst give people context

609
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,080
this is a great example of showing

610
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,000
interest in the user and having really

611
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,200
clear concise

612
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,480
professional communication

613
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,840
so i'm going to share another story with

614
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,000
you

615
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,799
so i received a call one day in the sock

616
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,799
and i could tell immediately that this

617
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,559
this gentleman carl was sick i could

618
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,640
hear he was congested i could hear the

619
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,000
wheezing in his voice

620
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,760
but i could also hear the tension and

621
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,080
the stress and he said to me i'm

622
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,200
homesick

623
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,760
i'm on a lot of cold medicine and i

624
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,440
realized that i just clicked on

625
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,480
a malicious email so i said okay now

626
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,320
this talk isn't about remediation so i'm

627
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,679
not going to go through

628
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,080
what i did but i you know was able to

629
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,760
get information from him of

630
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,919
which email he was referring to and i

631
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,360
investigated

632
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,280
and long story short it turns out it you

633
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,600
know was a false positive

634
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,600
no harm no foul the site that he clicked

635
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,760
on was actually taken down

636
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,960
everything's fine but the part stuck in

637
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,159
my head of

638
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,799
okay he's kind of drugged up right now

639
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,679
and he made a poor security decision

640
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,080
what can i do to show interest and kind

641
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,159
of help on the side of security

642
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,480
so i came up with a little bit of a fib

643
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,080
i said okay carl

644
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,000
we are going to do a virus scan of your

645
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,280
laptop

646
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,760
are you able to spend an hour away from

647
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,640
your laptop

648
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,039
now you and i know that it doesn't

649
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,480
necessarily take an hour

650
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,720
to do a virus scan but again fibbing for

651
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,400
the purpose of security

652
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,240
and he said yes i can step away for an

653
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,960
hour i said okay let's do this

654
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,320
i'm going to walk you through how to

655
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,200
initiate a virus scan on your laptop

656
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,559
go take a nap go take an hour nap

657
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,760
when you feel refreshed go back on your

658
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,120
computer and he said oh that's a good

659
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:13,919
idea

660
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,440
i'm gonna do that and i could tell i

661
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,440
could hear the tension

662
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,880
leave his voice i could still hear that

663
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,039
he was sick but i could feel the tension

664
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,480
go away

665
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,480
so that's how we left things now again i

666
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,159
told a little bit of a fib

667
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,320
but again i was very quickly thinking

668
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,559
what other bad security decisions is he

669
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:31,840
gonna make while he's under the

670
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,600
influence of coal medicine

671
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,559
so i just you know made a quick decision

672
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,679
of you know what i'm gonna

673
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,000
i'm gonna fib a little bit and no harm

674
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,080
no foul he got to take a nap

675
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,080
he understood what he did was wrong

676
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,320
there's no need to beat him up for it

677
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,640
virus scan came back clean all is right

678
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,840
in the world

679
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,520
so now let's talk about listening i know

680
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,640
it's very

681
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,200
uh easy to want to jump in and you you

682
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,559
already have the person's problem

683
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,080
figured out or so you think

684
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,000
when they're talking to you resist the

685
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
urge to jump ahead and say i know what

686
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,159
this is

687
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,159
i want you to pay attention to what the

688
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,600
end user doesn't

689
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,799
say and this is a little bit tricky but

690
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,039
i want you to think about what they're

691
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,240
not telling you

692
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,120
and how do you do this so basically you

693
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,080
know how to do

694
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,240
troubleshooting and remediation in your

695
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,480
head right so think of it as a checklist

696
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,919
and until you get really good at it you

697
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,440
may need to write this down but say you

698
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,720
go through your head

699
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,240
of all the ways you would remediate the

700
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,960
problem is that user saying the

701
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,880
information that's ticking the boxes for

702
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,080
you to remediate the problem

703
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,159
if they're not then you go back and you

704
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,520
follow up on that so let me give you an

705
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,679
example someone will say

706
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,279
i know i'm using a lot of phishing

707
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,720
emails as examples but they're the

708
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,000
easiest ones to do but

709
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,080
you're smart enough to correlate this to

710
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,200
other issues

711
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,440
so say someone calls you and said i

712
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,360
clicked on an email

713
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,360
that when i went to the website it

714
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,960
looked really strange

715
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,600
and i closed it and then i called you

716
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,880
okay great thank you for contacting us

717
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,679
in my mind i think i want to know what

718
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,039
happened between the click and the

719
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,440
closing they didn't say anything

720
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,120
i think most of us would assume that

721
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,720
nothing happened

722
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,000
but i go in with a pointed question

723
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,960
okay great so tell me what action did

724
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,600
you take

725
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,000
before you close the browser and this

726
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,679
actually happened one time someone said

727
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,279
to me oh well

728
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,039
uh it asked for my microsoft 365 login

729
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,520
so i entered the information and when i

730
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,080
hit enter nothing happened so then i

731
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,640
figured something was wrong and i closed

732
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,080
the browser and i called you

733
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,760
so i think we all can figure out what

734
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,120
happened right their password was just

735
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,000
stolen

736
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,080
but they didn't say that the first time

737
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,840
again not because they're they're stupid

738
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,760
not because they're dumb

739
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,480
to them that wasn't a detail that was

740
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,919
necessary that didn't mean anything to

741
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,440
them but that means the world to us

742
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,440
right so you need to listen to what they

743
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,960
don't say

744
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,840
users may omit information because they

745
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,279
don't realize it's relevant

746
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,880
or sometimes they're very nervous when

747
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,320
they contact security and they're just

748
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,840
not thinking straight

749
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,159
you need to listen for what is not being

750
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,480
said

751
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,600
f scott fitzgerald said to be kind is

752
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,480
more important than to be right

753
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,400
many times what people need is not a

754
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,240
brilliant mind that speaks

755
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,440
but a special heart that listens don't

756
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,919
lecture someone about how they hell fell

757
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,360
for an obvious phishing

758
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,520
email or overlooked what we would

759
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,159
consider to be an easy security fix

760
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,960
don't say i told you so just listen

761
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,320
the next step is interviewing one of the

762
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,080
best techniques is to

763
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,000
to repeat back what the person just said

764
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,760
you whether that's an email

765
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,720
in person or over the phone that shows

766
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,200
the

767
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,360
the listener or the recipient that

768
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,880
you're paying attention and that you

769
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,880
understand the problem

770
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,400
remember what i just talked about about

771
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,640
paying attention to what they don't say

772
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,080
i talked about this a little bit already

773
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,799
but i'm going to to emphasize this

774
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,279
you then need to ask questions but not

775
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,000
in an accusatory manner

776
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,600
what did you do what did you do is

777
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,440
is very accusatory right it sounds like

778
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,720
blame

779
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,279
it's very hard to say that without it

780
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,000
sounding like

781
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,399
blame so what i recommend is that you

782
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,559
try some other phrases

783
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,279
what action did you take what happened

784
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,240
next

785
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,120
what transpired remember that meme of

786
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,880
bill hader eating the popcorn i want you

787
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,840
to be like that oh

788
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,240
it's like a mystery what happened next

789
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,799
what action did you take

790
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,799
not what did you do again you don't want

791
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,559
to have blame you want them to

792
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,559
you want it's solicitation you want to

793
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,880
draw as much information out of them

794
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,480
and there's an old expression of you get

795
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,520
more flies with honey than vinegar

796
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,520
you want the honey to flow so that the

797
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,120
information will flow so that you can

798
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,399
solve these problems

799
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:09,919
and this is whether it's an end user or

800
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,399
maybe the the devs and engineering

801
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,440
department

802
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,440
maybe they're talking about something

803
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,720
and they're maybe

804
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,399
not sharing all the information because

805
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:19,919
they don't think it's relevant

806
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,559
so just ask some questions in a nice way

807
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,159
to let the information flow so that you

808
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,919
can work on a security problem together

809
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,279
searching now this is kind of redundant

810
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,480
because a lot of what we do

811
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,080
is searching anyway to solve problems

812
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,360
but i want to i want to give you some

813
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,120
ideas of different ways to to look at

814
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,640
this

815
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,679
one way to look at it is did a security

816
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,559
precaution fail the end user

817
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,960
or the other department was it really

818
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,120
their fault

819
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,440
you know help the user connect the dots

820
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,720
i can't stress this enough

821
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,559
don't let security get in the way of

822
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,039
people doing their jobs

823
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,679
one example of this is one time i was in

824
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:02,480
a meeting

825
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,360
with another department and they came to

826
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,720
security and said we would like to

827
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,640
purchase this new software

828
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,480
and we'd like security you know to give

829
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,000
it its blessing

830
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,840
and in hindsight i think we as security

831
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,039
were probably a little too

832
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,919
harsh on this other department really

833
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,120
picking apart

834
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,279
their software choice and raising issues

835
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,880
and things like that

836
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,960
and something that the the manager of

837
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,399
the other department said really just

838
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,440
struck me

839
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,440
and really just made me pay attention

840
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,039
and correct my ways

841
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,760
he said why do i feel like my department

842
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,799
is being punished for coming to security

843
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,080
oh all the things that i hold dear about

844
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,080
being a security advocate that just was

845
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,679
a knife through the heart

846
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,520
he was absolutely right we were making

847
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,120
them feel bad we were giving them an

848
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,960
extraordinary tough time

849
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,039
when they did the right thing how many

850
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,960
other departments just buy software and

851
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,200
don't ever involve security

852
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,720
so how did that procedure fail

853
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,000
that department you know then that gave

854
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,279
us

855
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,880
that gave us encouragement of how to

856
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,559
change the process

857
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,760
so that wouldn't happen again so you

858
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,200
need to search for ways to solve

859
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,880
problems when you may not have realized

860
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,120
that there was a problem

861
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,480
so let's talk about another story let's

862
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,039
talk about accounts receivable rhonda

863
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,559
so one day i get an email

864
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,080
and rhonda explains that she's new to

865
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,520
uh she's not new to the company but

866
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,600
she's new to this position where she now

867
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,200
has to pay invoices

868
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,799
and she's been doing it for about you

869
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,880
know a month or two and there's this one

870
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,600
vendor

871
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,760
that they pay weekly that all of a

872
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,200
sudden

873
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,279
it the invoice shows up and it's

874
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,279
different than before it used to be just

875
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,159
a pdf

876
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,640
attachment but now it's a link to you

877
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,799
know docusign or some

878
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,520
some site like that and she didn't know

879
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,120
what to do so immediately they gave her

880
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,480
pause so the first thing i did was

881
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,440
commend her

882
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,880
for contacting security and

883
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,120
you know asked her questions about it so

884
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,080
i said let me

885
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,919
let me investigate this docusign and

886
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,440
i'll get back to you because we know

887
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,679
a lot of times phishing emails go

888
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,919
through sites like that

889
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,840
so i tore everything apart i couldn't

890
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,679
find anything wrong with this so i

891
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,159
this time i called rhonda back and i

892
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:19,440
said

893
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,960
rhonda do you have a contact at this

894
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,080
company and she said yes joanne i said

895
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,919
okay

896
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,200
can you talk to joanne to see if this is

897
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,279
a new method that they're using

898
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,279
and ronda's response was well yes i can

899
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,399
email her

900
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:37,760
and this is when i helped rhonda connect

901
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,440
the dots i said rhonda

902
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,919
if this company has been compromised and

903
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,919
their email is compromised

904
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,440
there's a chance that if you email

905
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,919
joanne you might be

906
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,279
emailing the the bad actor

907
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,039
she hadn't thought of that and she was

908
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,480
very apologetic and i said don't

909
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,840
apologize it's

910
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,919
it's fine security's my job i'm helping

911
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,000
you understand this so i said i

912
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,440
i said do you know what her voice is

913
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,880
have you talked to her before she said

914
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,600
yes

915
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,200
said great call her ask her about this

916
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,519
so

917
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,760
long story short they changed the way

918
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,519
that they did invoices and

919
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,600
bothered to not tell anyone that they

920
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,480
were invoicing that they changed it

921
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,720
so again rhonda if she had not reached

922
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,320
out to security

923
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,840
she might have what just paid the

924
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,559
invoice and in this case it was safe but

925
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,679
what if it wasn't

926
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,519
what if months went by and then the

927
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,120
vendor said hey you haven't paid us for

928
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,399
months and ronda's saying

929
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,279
no i've paid you all this time but

930
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,799
rhonda also didn't understand about

931
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,240
email compromise because again that's

932
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,840
not ronda's job i've told this story

933
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,960
before and people

934
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,720
will push back and say oh well rhonda

935
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,000
should have should have known

936
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,640
why security's not rhonda's job it's my

937
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,200
job

938
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,200
it's my job to help rhonda connect the

939
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,960
dots which i did

940
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,000
so again i took time to explain to her

941
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,279
that situation

942
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,120
and then from that moment on she knew

943
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,480
that whenever something looked different

944
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,320
she would reach out for assistance

945
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,559
and she knew that maybe emailing back

946
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,720
wasn't the right way to do that

947
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,720
so you need to kind of search for

948
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,320
answers in a different way and help

949
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:06,960
people

950
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,200
find those answers

951
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,240
so now let's talk about answering uh

952
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,000
again i can't stress this enough you

953
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,679
need to thank people for contacting

954
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:18,480
security

955
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,320
and you need to remind them i've already

956
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,760
mentioned this once or twice you need to

957
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,159
remind people that they did a good thing

958
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,799
even if it's a false alarm you need to

959
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,559
remind them you did a good thing by

960
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,399
contacting us because in my mind i'm

961
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,720
looking at the big picture of

962
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,360
okay well we saved this time what if we

963
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,320
weren't

964
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,440
you know this was good that she

965
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,760
contacted us uh another

966
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,519
phrase that i like to use is it's it's a

967
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,039
very american-centric thing to say

968
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,600
you're welcome if someone says thank you

969
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,919
what i prefer to say is my pleasure to

970
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,399
help or just my pleasure

971
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,799
because again i i feel like we're not

972
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,080
doing them a favor

973
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,600
i feel like if someone says thank you

974
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,200
and you say you're welcome i feel

975
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,799
like it's more like a transactional

976
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,120
favor this is my job

977
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,080
this is my passion this is what i enjoy

978
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,360
i don't want to say you're welcome i'm

979
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,799
going to say my pleasure

980
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,719
so it's my pleasure to help and if you

981
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,239
don't feel comfortable saying that then

982
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,239
then think of something else but just

983
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,079
you know respond to them in a way that

984
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,679
you know you want to create that safe

985
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,119
space that they feel good that they

986
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,320
reached out to you

987
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,079
so when you answer people i also want to

988
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,520
bring up something called

989
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,239
a teachable moment teachable moment is

990
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,599
something that we talk a lot about

991
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,879
library science it's

992
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,199
it's when you take that extra time to

993
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,719
kind of show someone

994
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,000
the the way of you know of the mistake

995
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,440
that they made and show them how to do

996
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,879
something right going forward

997
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,040
so this is an example of a teaching

998
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,399
material from a

999
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,280
university in canada and i would keep

1000
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,440
things like this saved on my desktop

1001
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,639
all the time and i would use them

1002
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,159
as as teachable moments of you know hey

1003
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,359
let's let me show you

1004
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,440
how that really works so this is a good

1005
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,800
thing to have now whether it's your

1006
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,480
regular educational material or

1007
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,000
something you create yourself

1008
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,640
it's also good to keep these in a format

1009
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,079
that you can send to someone whether

1010
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,680
it's an internal link

1011
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,640
or a pdf or something something that you

1012
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,480
can send to them because

1013
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,480
most of the time i have found that

1014
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,079
people are willing to stay on the phone

1015
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,880
or stay on an email exchange with me to

1016
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,160
learn this but sometimes you'll get

1017
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,520
someone who'll be like i don't have time

1018
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,400
for that

1019
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,320
i just want to go so you want to be able

1020
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,680
to send it to them too so

1021
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,359
have things saved on your desktop or

1022
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,119
somewhere easy to access

1023
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,560
have something that you can send to

1024
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,560
people that they know that it's safe for

1025
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,680
them to look at

1026
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,280
and you want to have create teachable

1027
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,960
moments in the spot

1028
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,720
while it's fresh they can understand

1029
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,640
what they they did incorrectly

1030
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,520
and again most of the time i have found

1031
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,040
that people are willing to do it

1032
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,560
to listen to me because i've done all

1033
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,079
these other steps and make them feel

1034
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:48,960
listened

1035
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,599
and heard and comfortable but again i

1036
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:52,000
know

1037
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,599
and i worked for law firms for a long

1038
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,440
time i know that not everyone is going

1039
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,880
to be receptive to that

1040
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,280
so you do your best but teachable

1041
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,160
moments

1042
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,960
on the spot are great ways to help

1043
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,720
create a culture of security

1044
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,560
by showing people how to do the right

1045
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,480
thing

1046
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,240
so let's talk about a time that i did a

1047
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,000
teachable moment

1048
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,320
so mike actually called the sock

1049
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,599
and said uh i'm having this issue with

1050
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:20,240
my mouse

1051
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,599
that it's jumping all over my screen

1052
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,640
and i said oh okay mike well

1053
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,520
you've reached the security office it

1054
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,760
sounds like you might need the help desk

1055
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,359
may i transfer you over there and

1056
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,200
i gave him the opportunity to give me

1057
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,440
more information which he did he then

1058
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,640
said well

1059
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,440
i just spoke to the help desk and they

1060
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,520
said this is a security issue

1061
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,200
and i said oh why is that he said well

1062
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,680
last week i went to a malicious site

1063
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,400
on my laptop and now my mouse doesn't

1064
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,760
work

1065
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,520
oh okay so that is information i could

1066
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,440
have used a few minutes ago

1067
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,680
i did not say that but i'm thinking okay

1068
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,520
so now i have more information so now

1069
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,040
this is a new game right

1070
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,480
now we we may have a security issue so

1071
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,280
i do all the steps to figure out where

1072
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,160
he went

1073
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,960
what he did did anything download and

1074
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,560
everything i'm finding is coming up

1075
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,320
clean his computer's clean

1076
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,920
i'm not seeing any downloads and not

1077
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,520
seeing anything

1078
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,200
but i don't want to just abandon him be

1079
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,960
like okay everything looks good for

1080
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,760
security

1081
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,119
i'm going to send you back to the help

1082
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,240
desk i wanted to see this through

1083
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,960
and i don't know why or how but all of a

1084
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,200
sudden it came to me and i said mike

1085
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,839
are you using a wireless mouse to which

1086
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:42,720
he gasped

1087
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,240
oh you can see that through the computer

1088
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,400
no i cannot see that i said it's just a

1089
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,520
hunch here

1090
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,040
and he said yes i'm using a wireless

1091
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,280
mouse i said okay let's go with this

1092
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,480
when's the last time you changed the

1093
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,040
battery in that wireless mouse

1094
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,800
and there's a pause and he thinks and he

1095
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,079
goes

1096
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,599
never okay let's do this

1097
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,119
go find some fresh batteries try it out

1098
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,359
call me back so i moved on to my next

1099
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:10,240
problem

1100
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,200
he calls me back 15 minutes later very

1101
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,160
apologetic

1102
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,960
very sheepishly said yeah it was the

1103
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,680
batteries

1104
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,680
it the mouse is fine it just needed new

1105
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,599
batteries i said okay

1106
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,880
great your mouse problem is solved but

1107
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,760
i'd like to take a few minutes to go

1108
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,640
over

1109
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,480
that email you received which took you

1110
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,760
to that malicious

1111
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,400
website i want to show you the red flags

1112
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,200
that you

1113
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,160
perhaps missed or overlooked may i have

1114
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,800
some of your time to go through this now

1115
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,880
because i took the time to solve his

1116
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,560
problem and didn't make him feel bad

1117
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,280
about it

1118
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,040
he stayed on the phone with me while i

1119
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,560
was able to walk through and make it a

1120
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,640
teachable moment

1121
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,480
and he learned learned going forward and

1122
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,400
he he said to me said oh

1123
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,640
now some of this stuff up was new to me

1124
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,880
now i know this going forward

1125
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,880
i made that a teachable moment and

1126
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,240
that's because i was listening i was

1127
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,000
using these steps i was listening to

1128
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,160
what he said to what he didn't stay

1129
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,880
putting things together and then you

1130
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,160
know showed him

1131
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,560
this the the things that he did that he

1132
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,079
could improve upon and then i

1133
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,760
left him with i'm going to send you this

1134
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,160
email with this information

1135
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,920
and this was all all a good thing

1136
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,200
because otherwise what he would have

1137
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,560
been bouncing around

1138
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,880
between departments and the next time

1139
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,640
that there really was a serious issue he

1140
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,400
may not reach out to anyone

1141
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,079
because he had a bad treatment before

1142
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,920
let's get to step seven follow-up so

1143
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,920
this is the last of the seven steps

1144
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,440
and this is kind of what you want it to

1145
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,359
be this is things of

1146
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,839
think of initiatives to further create a

1147
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,200
culture of security with your own

1148
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,040
organizations

1149
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,640
are you short on time do you have

1150
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,079
playbooks written up

1151
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,480
for some of the the ordinary tasks that

1152
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,160
you see all the time or the ordinary

1153
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,040
problems

1154
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,359
this not only helps the people working

1155
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,200
security but also helps the end user

1156
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,079
because security

1157
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,000
then if there's a playbook and

1158
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,680
instructions of how to solve

1159
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,000
some of your most frequently seen issues

1160
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,760
you can get back to the end user quicker

1161
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,200
to solve their problem or get back to

1162
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,000
the other department

1163
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,560
quicker to solve the issues that they're

1164
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,440
having

1165
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,760
have guides that you can either give to

1166
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,640
departments or

1167
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,640
individuals or even to the security

1168
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,319
employees of how to handle

1169
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:24,079
responses you know what what language

1170
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,319
do you have for teachable moments what

1171
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,000
materials do you have

1172
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,440
you know come up with other ways to

1173
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,200
improve your end user

1174
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,440
interaction in your inter-department

1175
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,200
interaction

1176
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,240
but most importantly for follow-up

1177
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,240
turn takeaways from your user

1178
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,119
interaction into improvements

1179
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,800
do you realize that maybe there was a

1180
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,960
flaw in a system that could be improved

1181
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,680
upon

1182
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,760
like i mentioned the meeting before with

1183
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,440
the other department where

1184
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,400
maybe we weren't really so great to them

1185
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,240
i saw that that was a problem but i

1186
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,240
turned that into an opportunity

1187
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,880
to improve a process so really kind of

1188
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,640
do these these you know post-mortem

1189
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,240
evaluations of things

1190
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,640
are you identifying issues that you can

1191
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,240
then turn into gold

1192
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,520
because then that's going to make things

1193
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,480
better for everybody

1194
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,079
so some other things to follow up i like

1195
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:18,000
to call random acts of security kindness

1196
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,040
lead by example tell

1197
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,560
then show what do i mean by this

1198
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,280
don't just tell someone use a password

1199
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,079
manager

1200
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,760
and then walk away thinking that you are

1201
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,440
the most amazing security professional

1202
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,240
in the world

1203
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,280
because you dispensed some fairy dust of

1204
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,400
knowledge

1205
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,160
if you don't show them how to use a

1206
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,400
password manager they're not going to

1207
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,599
use it

1208
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,200
if there's another department that's

1209
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,119
doing something that might be secure

1210
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,720
don't just tell them that they're doing

1211
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,720
it wrong show them

1212
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,079
how to use it correctly facilitate

1213
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,079
security through kindness

1214
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,240
and this is perhaps one of my favorite

1215
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,480
ones that i call the cyber cupcake

1216
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,920
this came to me one day in the sock that

1217
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,960
i wanted to reward someone for

1218
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,640
for doing something good by bringing

1219
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,800
attention to a problem

1220
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,200
to us uh and also just being very

1221
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,640
receptive of how to

1222
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,119
remediate it and i couldn't think of

1223
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,880
anything to do and at the time i worked

1224
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,560
for this you know multi

1225
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,640
national global organization i couldn't

1226
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,400
send them anything

1227
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,640
so i thought what do people like people

1228
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,920
like cupcakes

1229
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,839
and they can be anything especially a

1230
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,359
picture of them can be anything you want

1231
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:32,720
they can be gluten-free they can be

1232
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,440
vegan

1233
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,200
they can have bacon on them in a photo

1234
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,720
whatever you want

1235
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,960
so i found a picture of a cupcake and i

1236
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,480
sent it to them an email and i said you

1237
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:40,960
know

1238
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,480
thank you for bringing this to our

1239
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,920
attention and for the great work for

1240
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,200
fixing it

1241
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,359
here is a cyber cupcake i called it a

1242
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,160
cyber cupcake

1243
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,319
sure i thought that they might roll

1244
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,440
their eyes and

1245
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,079
think i was dumb for sending that the

1246
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,480
response i got back was so heartwarming

1247
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,440
it was you made my day and i kept doing

1248
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:01,839
that

1249
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:03,280
so whether it was through a messenger

1250
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,240
with an emoji or this just jpeg i had

1251
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,599
saved on my desktop

1252
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,960
i send out cupcakes to reward positive

1253
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,119
behavior from a department or an end

1254
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:15,040
user and i've i've done this

1255
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,240
you know i i do this as often as i can

1256
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,319
not to the point that it ruins the

1257
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,160
surprise of a cupcake but

1258
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,520
you know if i see something somebody

1259
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,000
really went out of their way to do to

1260
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,560
work with security reward that positive

1261
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,280
behavior

1262
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,560
now if you work in a small enough

1263
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,079
organization where you can give actual

1264
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:33,040
cupcakes

1265
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,839
oh you're gonna be a big hero but for

1266
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:37,200
those of us who are more distant and

1267
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,640
everybody's kind of distance these days

1268
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,440
right

1269
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,319
you know a cupcake emoji goes a long way

1270
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:43,920
from making someone feel good about what

1271
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,480
they

1272
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,000
they did to help with security

1273
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,680
another way is to do outreach everybody

1274
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,480
loves snacks

1275
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,560
right so this is an actual photo of a

1276
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,720
king cake from a mardi gras

1277
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,200
party that that my department had we had

1278
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,240
an extra king cake

1279
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,960
so i had the thought oh our security

1280
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,800
office hours are tomorrow

1281
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,720
i'm going to bring this king cake to the

1282
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,720
office hours and when i tell people that

1283
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,680
we're open

1284
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,079
for office hours i'm going to tell

1285
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,680
people that we have cake

1286
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,280
and then they can have cake but they

1287
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,359
also have to talk to us about security

1288
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,839
so sure enough we had an amazing turnout

1289
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,200
and we did have some people who wanted

1290
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,319
to steal cake

1291
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,160
and run away but there was actually one

1292
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,599
person i i kept

1293
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:27,359
him in the doorway for five minutes

1294
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,440
while i talked to him about security

1295
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,280
and in the end was actually able to

1296
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,720
educate him about something he didn't

1297
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,520
know about

1298
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,680
while he stood there nibbling on his

1299
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,960
piece of cake

1300
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,760
and it was just it was a great session

1301
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,240
you know

1302
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,040
snacks bring people out in the office

1303
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,160
now again i know things are more

1304
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,160
difficult because we're all distance

1305
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,880
but someday in the future we will most

1306
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,680
likely be

1307
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,760
on site again or you can send people

1308
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,119
things you can send people say a

1309
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,160
starbucks

1310
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,359
uh gift card through email and as

1311
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,599
you know a snack for them you know think

1312
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:00,720
of it as a return on

1313
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,760
investment you know you want to

1314
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,319
to entice people to listen to you and

1315
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:06,960
snacks

1316
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,920
kind of help facilitate that i also want

1317
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,440
to share something that

1318
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,680
i we did for a long time in the last

1319
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,040
library i worked at

1320
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,720
now again this might not be possible for

1321
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,000
all of you but i just want to share this

1322
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,839
as an example of something we did

1323
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:21,680
so every christmas time everyone on the

1324
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,359
library staff would bake home goods

1325
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:24,480
cookies

1326
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,440
cakes cupcakes you know candies you name

1327
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:27,839
it

1328
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,520
we'd all bring them in on this appointed

1329
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,359
day and we'd create these big

1330
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,319
trays full of snacks and wrap them up

1331
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:35,680
real nice and then we'd walk through the

1332
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,359
firm and we'd give them to

1333
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,280
the help desk to the mail room to

1334
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,520
accounting to the receptionists

1335
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,119
to thank them for working with us

1336
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:44,720
throughout the year

1337
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,319
and this was relationship building and

1338
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:50,480
you know some some people have heard me

1339
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,920
tell the story and say oh well you just

1340
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,359
bribed them

1341
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,680
no we didn't bribe them to do anything

1342
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,680
it was not in exchange for anything it

1343
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,839
was out of the goodness of our hearts

1344
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:00,560
but that

1345
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,560
return on investment goes a long way

1346
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,480
because six months later when it's

1347
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,280
4 59 on a friday of a holiday weekend

1348
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,160
and you need a check

1349
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,160
cut and someone from accounting will

1350
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,079
stay late to help you

1351
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,560
a cookie tray goes a long way to build

1352
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,440
that

1353
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,480
that inter-department relationships that

1354
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,319
help you so we all need each other to

1355
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,119
succeed

1356
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:23,040
so do things like outreach and nice

1357
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,160
things like that

1358
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,160
to have a return on investment of

1359
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,440
kindness

1360
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,720
and it's relationship building

1361
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:32,800
i want to bring up the lunch and learn

1362
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,960
this is not a new concept and a lot of

1363
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,480
people think of lunch and learns

1364
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,720
as dealing with end users i want to

1365
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,240
throw the idea out there of doing a

1366
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,000
lunch and learn with other departments

1367
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,240
and again i've said this a couple times

1368
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,720
i know from experience that other tech

1369
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,920
departments

1370
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,760
see security as a mystery and so

1371
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,720
why not come together for a meal have

1372
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,000
them spend 15 minutes

1373
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,359
talking about what they're working on

1374
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:58,720
spend 15 minutes talk about what

1375
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,079
security's working on

1376
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:01,520
figure out how you can work on things

1377
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,760
together outreach to your other

1378
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,839
departments within the organization

1379
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,839
can again help build a culture of

1380
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:10,880
security

1381
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,720
now i want to share this with you but i

1382
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,240
want to be careful about the wording

1383
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,560
because i am in no way trying to say

1384
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,000
that education is not important uh this

1385
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,599
is an actual article that appeared in

1386
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,200
the washington post on april 4

1387
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,240
2018 it's all about a study from the

1388
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,920
journal of psychological science in the

1389
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,440
public interest

1390
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,760
and one of the scientists said uh

1391
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,599
well sorry the headline is people can't

1392
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,599
be educated into vaccinations but

1393
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:39,119
behavioral nudges help

1394
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,640
now when i read this in my mind i

1395
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,319
thought oh if you replace that with

1396
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:44,240
information security

1397
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,599
that reflects a lot of what we're

1398
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:47,680
dealing with so then it reads people

1399
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,280
can't be educated into information

1400
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,520
security but behavioral nudges help

1401
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,760
now again please read the full article

1402
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,520
and the study because i am absolutely

1403
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,280
not saying that education doesn't help

1404
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,000
education does very much help

1405
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,839
the point of me sharing this is is that

1406
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,280
other disciplines

1407
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,000
deal with very similar problems as we do

1408
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,920
and they all have ways different than

1409
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,440
than we've ever seen

1410
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,400
of dealing with them so there was a

1411
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,400
health official who was quoted

1412
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,040
in this this journal article who said

1413
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,960
when it comes to vaccines i think we

1414
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,000
have this optimistic

1415
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,920
belief that just by telling people facts

1416
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,839
you can change their behavior

1417
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:25,280
again replace that with information

1418
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,359
security when it comes to information

1419
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:28,400
security

1420
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,240
i think we have this optimistic belief

1421
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,319
that just by telling people facts you

1422
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:34,240
can change their behavior does that

1423
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,440
sound familiar

1424
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,880
again i want you to tell then show

1425
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,440
you know just don't spell statistics you

1426
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,000
know

1427
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,119
oh you know 85 percent of companies who

1428
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,200
you know were compromised did it through

1429
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,480
email okay

1430
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,240
that's a nice statistic but that doesn't

1431
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,920
really help the end user it doesn't help

1432
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,359
another department

1433
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:54,880
so what i really want to do is to keep

1434
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,800
an open mind and when you're looking at

1435
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,400
your follow-up step

1436
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,079
look to other industries other

1437
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,079
disciplines how do other people

1438
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:04,559
solve the similar problems that we have

1439
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:07,359
in security

1440
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:14,960
oh my computer just slowed down for a

1441
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,839
second here sorry

1442
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:31,839
what is happening

1443
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,599
sorry my computers

1444
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:50,880
okay so

1445
00:49:56,839 --> 00:49:59,839
man

1446
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:08,480
okay automation sorry about that um

1447
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,680
computers right automation uh has

1448
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,280
everything been automated that it can be

1449
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:13,920
while still

1450
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,079
maintaining approachability again i

1451
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,079
talked about having canned responses you

1452
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:20,000
know or playbook set up ahead of time

1453
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,920
but remember there are so many people

1454
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,680
out there who think that

1455
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,160
there's nothing but you know bleep blur

1456
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,520
blinky boxes

1457
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,359
uh behind the scenes make them know that

1458
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,520
there's there's humans there but for our

1459
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,040
sake for workload

1460
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,040
automate what you can but without losing

1461
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:41,119
that touch

1462
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:44,640
so to to wrap up here we have some

1463
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,920
we have our seven steps of

1464
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,079
approachability interest

1465
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,400
listening interviewing searching

1466
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,280
answering

1467
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,599
and follow-up these are all seven solid

1468
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:55,680
steps that we can apply to security

1469
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,799
and you can get a lot done

1470
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:06,880
thank you trace oh i'm not done yet

1471
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,920
i'm so sorry that's okay so um

1472
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,760
just a few more minutes everyone sorry

1473
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,040
uh so i've thrown a lot at you today

1474
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,240
so i'm going to give you some strategies

1475
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,800
for success or also why you should care

1476
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,119
about creating a culture of security

1477
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,200
one is the sugar bowl principle i know

1478
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,319
that we all have

1479
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:26,000
expensive blinky boxes to help with

1480
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,319
network security but remember security

1481
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:29,119
at its cure

1482
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:31,520
is human-centric so make your security

1483
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,040
team compatible with the humans that

1484
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,160
you're protecting

1485
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,680
the humans are your front line your

1486
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,760
infants infantry make sure they know how

1487
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,200
to report back to you

1488
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,920
the sugar bowl principle is if you have

1489
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,760
a bowl of sugar and you drop it on the

1490
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,240
floor

1491
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,559
the bowl shatters and the sugar goes

1492
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,240
everywhere you have two choices you can

1493
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,400
either clean it up right away to make it

1494
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,680
look to the point that nothing ever

1495
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,559
happened

1496
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:55,040
or you let it sit and fester maybe you

1497
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,880
cut your foot on the shard

1498
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,040
of the of the glass and the sugar gets

1499
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,640
under the tiles and now you have ants

1500
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,480
and you have a bigger problem

1501
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,040
i'd rather be approachable and have a

1502
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,720
user or department

1503
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,520
contact me at a minute before lunch

1504
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,440
about a problem than a minute before

1505
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,520
quitting time on a holiday weekend and

1506
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,200
then i have to spend all night and all

1507
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,800
weekend solving something

1508
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,800
if you make yourself approachable you'll

1509
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,480
learn about problems sooner

1510
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,680
and that's best for everyone

1511
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,280
another reason why i should care about

1512
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,760
security as a as a culture

1513
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,680
is because security is a cost center

1514
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,200
also known as overhead

1515
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,079
cost center versus profit center why may

1516
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,000
not make security the model for all the

1517
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,440
other departments

1518
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,280
when i was a librarian at my last firm

1519
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,119
the library consistently scored

1520
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:42,400
the highest of all the firm's

1521
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,319
departments when it came to internal

1522
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:46,960
customer satisfaction and performance

1523
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,960
and was held up as an example within the

1524
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,880
firm now i'm not saying that i

1525
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,640
specifically was the reason for that

1526
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,000
i'm just saying that i know what it's

1527
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,520
like to work on a high performing team

1528
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:01,839
and what success looks like

1529
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,040
now i want to give you a coping tip real

1530
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:05,760
quick

1531
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,000
uh dealing with a lot of of end users

1532
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,280
and other departments can be very

1533
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,640
stressful

1534
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,960
and you want to let that stress go what

1535
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,720
i dealt with a lot in the sock was a lot

1536
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,480
of co-workers saying things like stupid

1537
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,960
users stupid engineers stupid developers

1538
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,640
you know stupid this stupid that

1539
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,839
everybody was stupid i chose to take

1540
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,440
a little bit more positive route i

1541
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,559
channeled my inner southern u.s woman

1542
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,720
and if somebody did something that was

1543
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,559
you know not great security wise i'd

1544
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:34,240
just take a deep breath

1545
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,680
and just say bless their heart for

1546
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,160
trying now those of you who are familiar

1547
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,760
with this expression know

1548
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,920
this isn't actually a nice thing to say

1549
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:42,960
but it's a not

1550
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,079
nice thing to say said in a nice way

1551
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:48,000
um you know sometimes that's all you can

1552
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,760
do you need to get your stress out but i

1553
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,160
prefer to do it in a more positive way

1554
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,920
just deep breath click my tongue you

1555
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,680
know they are just

1556
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,200
bless their heart for trying they are

1557
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,119
just doing the best with what the lord

1558
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:00,559
gave them you know what

1559
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:03,680
and just exhale and go about your day

1560
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:11,520
sometimes that's the best you can do

1561
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,240
and then i just want to kind of leave

1562
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,319
you with some thoughts here

1563
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,800
a lot of this human interaction may be

1564
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,319
out of the comfort zone for a lot of

1565
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:21,760
people here

1566
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,440
but you know what the great thing is

1567
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,680
it's just a skill like anything else you

1568
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,119
didn't come out of the womb knowing how

1569
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:27,839
to code

1570
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,280
you had to learn how to code and you had

1571
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,760
to perfect it and you had to hone it

1572
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,200
these people skills are just that

1573
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,040
they're just skills that you learn

1574
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,520
and you hone it might come easier to

1575
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,359
some people than others

1576
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,040
but the late tennis great arthur ashe

1577
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,079
famously said start where you are

1578
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:48,559
use what you have do what you can

1579
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,359
and our parting thought for today it's

1580
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:54,720
from the late author

1581
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,160
lebanese author khalil gibran

1582
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,799
tenderness and kindness are not signs of

1583
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:02,640
weakness and despair

1584
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,880
but manifestations of strength and

1585
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,720
resolution

1586
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,079
now go out there be strong use empathy

1587
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,680
as a service to create a culture of

1588
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,960
security

1589
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:21,520
i believe in you thank you

1590
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,319
thank you crazy that was amazing i

1591
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:25,680
apologize for interrupting you the

1592
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,880
audience was very emphatic that they

1593
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,880
wanted more tracy

1594
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,799
when that happened i and i apologize for

1595
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:32,799
the uh computer issue but you know

1596
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:35,280
computers um just a hashtag shameless

1597
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:35,839
plug

1598
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:38,000
the first one's my ocean blog the next

1599
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
is my nuzzle newsletter

1600
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,480
uh and then it's my my twitter but uh

1601
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,599
yeah i'm happy to take

1602
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:46,559
to take questions so i actually have a

1603
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:49,119
great question from emily cole

1604
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:52,240
okay they say i'd love to hear tracy

1605
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:52,640
talk

1606
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,200
about ways to influence people to build

1607
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,200
more security into their products

1608
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,640
which i'm assuming that means you know

1609
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,720
working with colleagues

1610
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,280
who may be in product development and

1611
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,880
other technologists who are not in

1612
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,200
security at your organization

1613
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,240
uh sure do you have another hour

1614
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:14,160
to spare about that um

1615
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,880
ver as quickly as i can emily um you

1616
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,680
know it's again

1617
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,200
using these techniques of you know

1618
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,720
meeting with them

1619
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,720
understand try to understand what their

1620
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,240
challenges are why

1621
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:27,040
do they think security is a blocker for

1622
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:27,680
them

1623
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,440
i would kind of start with i would start

1624
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,960
with a reference interview

1625
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,119
you know show them how something is

1626
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:34,319
insecure

1627
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:37,599
and ask them you know like this this

1628
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:38,319
could be

1629
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:40,559
more secure this way you know have you

1630
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:41,359
thought of that

1631
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:42,720
there's a chance they haven't even

1632
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,960
thought of it but i would try to find

1633
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,799
out their motivations

1634
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:49,119
find out what they think why they think

1635
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:50,960
security is a blocker

1636
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,680
to them um you may not get great answers

1637
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,520
they may just shrug their shoulders and

1638
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:55,839
i

1639
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:58,240
i went to a developer's con conference

1640
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,440
once and

1641
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,839
nobody cared about security and they

1642
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:03,119
told me as such

1643
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:06,480
um but on the one hand i took away from

1644
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,920
it okay well this is the attitude i'm

1645
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:08,799
dealing with

1646
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:11,440
so now i'll prepare that way so i would

1647
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,040
try to discuss with people

1648
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,440
why they think security is a blocker and

1649
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,000
kind of go from there and then again

1650
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,480
tell then show tell them how it can be

1651
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,280
better and then

1652
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:25,119
show them so i hope that helps

1653
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,720
wonderful um and sarah clark asks

1654
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,799
how you've dealt with raising executive

1655
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:33,040
level awareness of basics

1656
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:36,160
uh which can be a managing up challenge

1657
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:39,359
sure um now a lot of times that's not

1658
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:42,480
personally my responsibility but i've

1659
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,160
worked as part of a team

1660
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,599
for it you know

1661
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,000
you need to make it personalized to them

1662
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,200
so

1663
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,640
you know they may say you know well

1664
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,119
i'm you know at my old job in the sock

1665
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:58,720
you know we'd have people say

1666
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,799
well i'm not on social media and i would

1667
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:01,839
say well

1668
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:04,880
is your spouse or your kids you know you

1669
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:05,200
come

1670
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,359
at it from different ways and usually

1671
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:08,799
that's the buy-on

1672
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:12,079
of oh okay because a lot of times they

1673
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:13,520
they don't think outside of their own

1674
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,359
scope of things

1675
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:17,920
um if it helps depending on who you're

1676
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:18,720
talking to

1677
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:22,480
talk about the cost benefits the savings

1678
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,760
people executives love safety right

1679
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,520
so figure out ways to to demonstrate

1680
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,920
security as a cost-saving measure

1681
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,640
and i guarantee you a lot of executives

1682
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:35,119
will

1683
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:38,240
will respond to that uh so again there's

1684
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,680
a great

1685
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,599
uh some great articles out there about

1686
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:43,359
brain types

1687
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:45,760
uh you you've kind of figure out the

1688
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,599
brain type of the person you're speaking

1689
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:47,920
to

1690
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,240
and you address those you know maslow

1691
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,760
hierarchy of needs

1692
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,440
with them you figure out what they hold

1693
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,520
most dear and address that if they're

1694
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:58,480
if they're cost very cost conscious cost

1695
00:58:58,480 --> 00:58:59,359
centric

1696
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:01,440
then address costs of security how it's

1697
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,520
a good thing like well we could spend x

1698
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,799
amount and protect you now

1699
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:07,839
or we could spend x millions amounts

1700
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:08,640
later to

1701
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,760
recover you know from a breach and and

1702
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,280
things like that so

1703
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,280
if you kind of put it that way then then

1704
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,839
a lot of people understand i hope that

1705
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:18,319
helps

1706
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:20,079
i think that's that's fantastic thank

1707
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:21,839
you um

1708
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:25,520
cassandra brunetto um is curious what

1709
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,200
your most challenging experience was

1710
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,040
with a customer or client

1711
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:32,160
and how you navigated that sure

1712
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,000
it's not actually a security example

1713
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,079
cassandra but i'd like to share

1714
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:37,839
one with you when i was at the law firm

1715
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:39,599
library i had this one

1716
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:41,760
uh you know when this one attorney he

1717
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,880
was very old

1718
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,160
um he was a let me let me freeze this

1719
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:46,960
delicately

1720
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:50,319
uh he was close to retirement um and he

1721
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:52,160
was just very persnickety

1722
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,920
and he would fight with me tooth and

1723
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,000
nail all the time he constantly wanted

1724
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,440
me to purchase books

1725
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,599
for him and it got very contentious and

1726
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:01,359
it got very stressful

1727
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:03,280
and one day my boss said you two were

1728
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,280
gonna go to lunch and hash this out

1729
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,359
because i'm tired of hearing about it

1730
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:11,119
from both of you so we went to lunch

1731
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:13,760
and he explained to me that you know he

1732
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,200
was concerned that he was getting pushed

1733
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,640
out of the firm because he was close to

1734
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:17,599
retirement

1735
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:19,440
and he wanted all these books because he

1736
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,280
wanted to to show that he could take on

1737
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,200
different types of cases

1738
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,440
i said okay i understand that but i only

1739
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,559
have a certain budget

1740
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:29,040
that i can buy books with i can't just

1741
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,720
buy every book for your whim so we

1742
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,880
we hashed all this out and we came to an

1743
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,119
understanding and i said i understood

1744
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:37,680
where he was coming from and i made a

1745
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,280
deal with him i said

1746
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,559
when you sign a client you know actually

1747
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:44,480
sign the paper sign a client

1748
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,640
to a different area of law for which you

1749
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,480
do not have a book

1750
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,240
then i will buy it for you and he was

1751
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,559
happy with that but until that we were

1752
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:54,000
really butting heads a lot and it was

1753
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,640
very stressful situation so uh yeah it

1754
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,920
took being forced

1755
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,640
together over lunch uh to hash out to

1756
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,079
understand his point of view

1757
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,520
and then i was able to make you know a

1758
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:05,200
reasonable accommodation

1759
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,520
for that and from then on like i was his

1760
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,520
librarian like he only wanted to talk to

1761
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:10,319
me

1762
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:12,799
and uh you know but smooth sailing then

1763
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:15,119
i was able to really then call the shots

1764
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,599
of you know and say things like no you

1765
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:18,960
already own that book oh

1766
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,520
right right okay uh so i hope that helps

1767
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:22,240
but uh

1768
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,839
yeah it's sometimes it's just kind of

1769
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,520
understanding someone's situation they

1770
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:28,160
they might bark a lot but if you uh you

1771
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,440
know get down sit down and

1772
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,559
really understand what their problems

1773
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:32,640
are what their motivations are then you

1774
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:35,119
can work with that

1775
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:38,880
