1
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,200
hello everybody

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,720
and welcome back to stage three

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,439
so uh just some quick housekeeping i

4
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,920
want to thank all our sponsors

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,519
um again those are mongodb

6
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,199
microsoft verizon salesforce

7
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,039
amazon information security e-learn

8
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,238
security intel

9
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,280
and remediate today we have amanda

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,960
giving her talk

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,160
i'm very excited by this um just quickly

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,600
to introduce amanda

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,000
amanda makes magic by using sticks to

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,879
turn fluff

15
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,079
into stuff she listens to complaints

16
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,120
of computers to pay the bills she's

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,960
going to take over

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,039
one quick second and we're going to run

19
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,480
q a afterwards

20
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,480
so i will be posting a link but feel

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,399
free to post your questions in the chat

22
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,120
room

23
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,920
please welcome amanda thank you so much

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,720
lee

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,880
as she mentioned i am amanda and i'm

26
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,159
going to be talking to you

27
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,880
about some lessons that i have learned

28
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,280
from

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,640
playing with string if you look at the

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,439
title and was

31
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,600
all excited about the command line tool

32
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,799
strings

33
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,119
sorry to disappoint this is not going to

34
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,799
be that talk

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,400
i'm going to be talking more about

36
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,159
string about yarn

37
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,880
and thread and things that you sew with

38
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,840
and knit with

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,799
and weave with those sorts of strings

40
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,920
so why in the heck am i talking about

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,320
textiles and fiber arts at a security

42
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,600
conference

43
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,200
well if you're at all familiar with the

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,680
history of computing and punch cards

45
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,920
you know that that was a technology that

46
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,439
was really originated

47
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,159
for jacquard looms so the original

48
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:52,880
computer

49
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,680
was something used to weave and this is

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,439
the same technology that you'll see

51
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,360
in knitting machines which are also a

52
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,280
very binary thing

53
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,799
knit versus purl or a knit stitch versus

54
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:05,759
a yarn over

55
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,318
to make a hole within the fabric lots of

56
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,959
different things that you can do here

57
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,360
and if you look at a lot of knitting and

58
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,040
crochet patterns

59
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,959
like the little snippet that you can see

60
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,640
below it looks a lot like

61
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,599
machine code that in particular is a

62
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,000
snippet

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,280
from the even star shawl but many other

64
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,920
patterns look very similar

65
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,640
so knowing all of this and also being a

66
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,400
computer geek

67
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,920
then there's this pandemic thing that

68
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,599
happened and

69
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,000
like so many other craftspeople

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,440
i started sewing cloth masks

71
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,879
so so many masks

72
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,519
some of them went to my colleagues and

73
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,239
some of them

74
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,760
got sent to medical facilities and elder

75
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,040
care facilities

76
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,920
and schools and things all over the

77
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,560
country

78
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,720
which massive shout out to u.s postal

79
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,920
service

80
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,400
current craziness with standing they do

81
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,080
awesome work

82
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,480
and while i was doing all of that sewing

83
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,360
and cutting

84
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,680
and measuring and all of these things i

85
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,680
realized there's some universal truce

86
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,720
out there

87
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,760
that regardless of what the craft

88
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,120
is whether you're doing fiber arts or

89
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,920
computer wizardry a lot of the same

90
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,519
concepts apply

91
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,959
and so i wanted to share some of the

92
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,680
things that i learned from that

93
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,799
first and foremost is the importance of

94
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,080
understanding how stuff works

95
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,000
warning there's an animation on the next

96
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,760
slide it's not blinky

97
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,159
but if moving pictures are a problem you

98
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,360
may want to look away from the screen

99
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,239
for a moment

100
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,120
so what you're looking at here is a

101
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,239
animation of how sewing machines work

102
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,360
now if you've ever wondered how the act

103
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:55,680
of

104
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,760
sewing that when you're doing it by hand

105
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,720
is this very clearly not

106
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,080
machine um capable

107
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,080
thing of putting an entire needle

108
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,519
through the fabric through the fabric

109
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,799
through the fabric

110
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,560
and so on and so forth like how does a

111
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,480
machine replicate that

112
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,640
well this animation answers that

113
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,519
question

114
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,399
turns out there's actually two threads

115
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,040
and

116
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,440
the machine is able to loop one around

117
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,720
the other

118
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,199
and that looping action is what holds

119
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,160
the two layers of fabric together

120
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,199
now once you understand this concept you

121
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:31,759
can do

122
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,560
a ton of troubleshooting on any issues

123
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,800
that your sewing machine is giving you

124
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,960
for example if the loops are pulling

125
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,960
towards the top of the fabric

126
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,360
well clearly the tension on that top

127
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,960
thread is greater than the bottom of

128
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,560
thread so you have to

129
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,040
loosen that top tension so the bottom

130
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,240
thread can come down

131
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,080
and the reverse is true now all of this

132
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,080
is material that you'll find in your

133
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,160
sewing machine's manual

134
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,560
if you still have a print manual anymore

135
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,560
a lot of them have gone online

136
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,280
but point being yes you can look this up

137
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,880
every single time that you have a

138
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,360
problem with your thread tension

139
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,240
or you can just understand how stuff

140
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,440
works

141
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,600
when you understand how it works you can

142
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,039
just fix it

143
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,639
you don't have to go look it up every

144
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,960
time you understand

145
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,320
this is a concept that we're going to

146
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,600
return to a lot during this talk

147
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,080
all right the animation's gone now next

148
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,280
we're going to talk about

149
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,120
automations you're probably asking

150
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,919
yourself

151
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,600
isn't the sewing machine automation

152
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,000
enough what other automations can i

153
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,280
add to the sewing process well you're

154
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,280
looking at a piece of automation on the

155
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,560
screen right now

156
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,919
those little plastic bits are

157
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,080
a really cool technological advance

158
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,960
in sewing or well properly in ironing

159
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,639
just think for a minute what could those

160
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:07,840
pieces of plastic be

161
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,160
so give you a little bit of a hint in

162
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,840
talking about ironing

163
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,919
it turns out these pieces of plastic are

164
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,039
a jig

165
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,240
if you're familiar at all with

166
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,400
woodworking you understand the concept

167
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,840
of a jig

168
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,600
it's something that takes a really

169
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,440
annoying process

170
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,039
and turns it into a really easy process

171
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,720
for example if you're trying to cut a

172
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,120
piece of wood at an awkward angle

173
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,360
you can either measure it and hold it

174
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,759
exactly right every single time

175
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,000
or you build a jig so you can make the

176
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,199
exact same cut

177
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,720
every single time what this particular

178
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,919
jig does

179
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,199
is it handles the process of making bias

180
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,479
tape

181
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,880
which is one of the things that

182
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,560
especially with elastic

183
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,039
being at a premium right now is useful

184
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,680
for making ties for those masks

185
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,400
the bias tape is you take this piece of

186
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,599
fabric

187
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,520
and then you iron it in half

188
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,880
to make a crease and then you're going

189
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,120
to iron the edges in towards the middle

190
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,520
and then

191
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,240
fold it in half so ultimately you have

192
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,000
no raw edges

193
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,120
on that piece of tape but that is an

194
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,599
exceptionally painful and annoying

195
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:20,800
process

196
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,360
and i do mean painful literally because

197
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,280
as you're trying to hold things there

198
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,400
and getting the iron there you're

199
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
probably going to steam your fingers

200
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,039
and it physically hurts i do not

201
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:31,680
recommend

202
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,800
steaming your fingers

203
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,280
but this concept illustrates a lot of

204
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,800
fundamental questions that you should

205
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,680
ask

206
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,280
as to whether you should keep doing a

207
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,800
process manually or

208
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,960
should you try to automate it and the

209
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,000
first is

210
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,400
is you know what is the task within a

211
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,280
process that

212
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,000
is physically painful granted with

213
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,599
computers you're not usually dealing

214
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,120
with physical pain

215
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,759
but there's often something about the

216
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,400
process

217
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,599
that is really annoying that is where

218
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,960
you're going to have the most return on

219
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,759
investment

220
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,800
for automating a process

221
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,360
another question to ask is what task

222
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,759
within that process is where human error

223
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,199
is especially easy and especially bad

224
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,479
so as i mentioned before with that bias

225
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,599
tape

226
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,400
the cost of you know the error and the

227
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,280
cost of that

228
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,759
is that you might burn your fingers and

229
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,520
you're steaming your fingers is bad if

230
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,039
you get close enough you actually run

231
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,958
the iron over your fingers

232
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,240
that's really really not good and

233
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,679
that's also really easy to do so

234
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,640
you know focus on where humans perform

235
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,679
the worst

236
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,040
that's probably where computers are

237
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,720
going to perform the best so again

238
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,760
that's where you're going to get a

239
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,480
really high return on investment

240
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,959
another thing to consider is what is the

241
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,880
task that isn't going to change much

242
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,360
with bias tape i can

243
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,519
know ahead of time that all of my tape

244
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,240
needs to be roughly the same size

245
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,600
and so that makes it worth

246
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,959
making a special doohickey to handle

247
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,120
that particular task

248
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,760
if on one mask i was going to have to

249
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,680
deal with one in strips of fabric on the

250
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,040
next one i was going to have to deal

251
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,360
with half inch strips of fabric

252
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,200
on the next one two inch strips of

253
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,040
fabric

254
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,920
that would be a ton of those little

255
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,680
plastic things that i would need in

256
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,440
order to deal with all that

257
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,399
is it possible to do that sure is it

258
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,240
worth it depending on how much tape i'm

259
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:38,959
making

260
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,640
maybe not and all of those

261
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,920
cost benefit analyses also talk

262
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,080
about you know is it worth

263
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,000
putting the work into automate versus

264
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,080
just throwing lots of people at it

265
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,040
if you look at textiles on a commercial

266
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,160
scale

267
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,399
you know your clothing factories aren't

268
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,240
shove a piece of fabric in one end

269
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,440
and a trousers pop out the other

270
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,399
it's a whole lot of humans doing

271
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,120
processes

272
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,480
as if they were machines so

273
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,480
sometimes even with the greatest

274
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,079
technology in the world

275
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,120
the answer is a lot of humans

276
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,600
and you part of that is the

277
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,800
changeability

278
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,880
how much do you need to be able to adapt

279
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,200
and to answer any of those questions you

280
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,800
have to go back to our first point

281
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,480
understanding how stuff works

282
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,959
this is important not just to decide if

283
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:35,920
to automate

284
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,279
but once you have an automation

285
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,680
solutions in place you still have to

286
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,760
understand how stuff works because

287
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,640
you know yes anyone can run a script

288
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,959
however when something fundamentally

289
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:47,839
changes

290
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,440
and that script breaks can your people

291
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,079
change the script or revert back to a

292
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,320
manual process

293
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,320
so even when you have automations you

294
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,760
still have to train your people

295
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,600
on how stuff works because things break

296
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
and you have to be able to compensate

297
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,079
for that

298
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,720
now every once in a while you can't

299
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,920
automate the process

300
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,440
like i was talking about before with the

301
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,279
clothing factories it comes down to a

302
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,440
lot of humans but what you can do to

303
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,839
make things a little bit easier

304
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,040
is batch processing so

305
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,680
what you see on the screen is an example

306
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,600
of batch processing

307
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,200
it is where i have instead of sewing an

308
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,640
entire mask

309
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,399
and then moving on to the next mask and

310
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,040
sewing an entire mask

311
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,279
i have done one step of sewing a mask

312
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,120
that is sewing the pleats down

313
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,600
in the middle right here and then i did

314
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,399
the next step

315
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,519
which was sewing the edges down right

316
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,560
here

317
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,200
if you look really closely you can see

318
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,920
especially right there

319
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,800
that everything is connected together i

320
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,600
didn't

321
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,399
cut everything between each mask which

322
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,200
is cool

323
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,600
and sped things up because i could just

324
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,200
keep shoving masks into the sewing

325
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,360
machine

326
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,760
however in this particular example i

327
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,560
actually over

328
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,440
optimized a little bit i over batch

329
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,959
processed

330
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,000
because you know while everything here

331
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,600
was all sewn together that meant

332
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,440
everything got all twisted up and

333
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,800
tangled as

334
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,920
i was sewing these parts

335
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,480
and that caused me to spend a lot of

336
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:34,959
time

337
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,920
just untangling things whereas if i

338
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,040
would have

339
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,480
cut in between each mask

340
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,839
while i would have spent time cutting

341
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,440
between each mask i would have saved a

342
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,440
lot of time untangling

343
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,880
so you know make sure that

344
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,480
you understand that sometimes

345
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,240
things like automations and batch

346
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,760
processing actually

347
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,360
slow everything down

348
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:07,120
next lesson to plan or not to plan

349
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,639
weaving is a highly planned craft

350
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,880
what you see on the left hand side is

351
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,320
what is known as a draft it's

352
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,200
essentially a weaving pattern

353
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,480
with some graph paper you can plot

354
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,600
out how you have to thread everything

355
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,279
into the loom

356
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,560
and then how you are going to

357
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,519
manipulate the loom in order to produce

358
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,399
certain patterns

359
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,320
if you don't plan this out you are going

360
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,240
to get utter and complete randomness

361
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,079
but also you end up with some

362
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,639
interesting things where

363
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,120
one draft so this piece on the top here

364
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,639
one of those but with multiple

365
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,920
different ways of manipulating the loom

366
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,839
can give you three different patterns

367
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,320
which you see on the right hand side all

368
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,800
three of those were from the exact same

369
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,519
draft and warp that is the yarn that you

370
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:07,920
use

371
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,279
when setting up the loom but

372
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,360
different manipulations to the loom and

373
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,639
different weft yarns

374
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,000
the yarn that i actually use to weave

375
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,600
with so

376
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,160
all the planning can give you multiple

377
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,199
different results

378
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,639
but you have to understand how stuff

379
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,079
works in order to plan that out

380
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,560
in contrast crochet is not so planned

381
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,959
here you can see our lovely iron snail

382
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,240
man

383
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,959
who you may recognize from my twitter

384
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,160
avatar now

385
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,360
crochet unlike weaving can be

386
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,399
a very improvisational craft

387
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,600
crochet allows you from one location

388
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,320
in your pattern to go literally anywhere

389
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,600
else on the object that you're

390
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,600
crocheting

391
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,959
so for example the little eyes that you

392
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,160
see

393
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,839
the pattern didn't tell me exactly where

394
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,839
to put the eyes it just said to put the

395
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:08,720
eyes in a

396
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,560
spot that looks kind of like eyes

397
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,800
instead of saying to do exactly this

398
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,240
many stitches

399
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,240
for this many rounds in order to produce

400
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,240
the body it was

401
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,079
keep going until you're at about yay

402
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,160
many inches

403
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,920
so you have a lot more freedom with

404
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,680
crochet

405
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,600
so when you're looking at your project

406
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,639
do you plan or do not plan are you

407
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,320
building the equivalent of network duct

408
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:36,720
tape

409
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,000
just get it fixed quickly are you

410
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,920
building something that's meant to last

411
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,920
are you building something that needs

412
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,240
robust documentation

413
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,759
are you building something where you

414
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,759
need to carefully consider

415
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,440
what programming language or what

416
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,120
framework you're using

417
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,600
to build that project or do you just

418
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,519
need it to work

419
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,600
in order to answer those questions you

420
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,560
have to understand

421
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,040
how stuff works how that project

422
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,920
supports

423
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,120
your particular business environment and

424
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,959
your company's priorities

425
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,720
next lesson tools don't matter

426
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,399
except for when they do

427
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,880
on the left you can see what is

428
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,600
essentially

429
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,079
the height of spinning technology for

430
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,440
the home spinner

431
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,320
it's an electric spinning wheel it has a

432
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:30,880
motor

433
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,800
and a battery and you can plug into the

434
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,399
wall or your car

435
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,320
and it has a foot pedal and speed

436
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,839
controls and a tension

437
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,360
knob and it is really cool i'm not gonna

438
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:41,759
lie

439
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,240
absolutely love it on the right hand

440
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,519
side you can see

441
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,240
a supported spindle which essentially is

442
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,079
a stick

443
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,839
now clearly the electric spinner

444
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,399
is the superior tool except it's not

445
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,399
it does have cool capabilities but what

446
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,720
if i want to spin for 10 hours and i'm

447
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,000
not going to be anywhere near

448
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
a power outlet well that battery is

449
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,119
going to run out after

450
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,319
maybe two hours tops

451
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,319
maybe i want to carry my spinning around

452
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,400
with me in a light bag

453
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
that electric spinner with its battery

454
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,480
is not something i want to toss in my

455
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,439
purse

456
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,640
whereas that stick absolutely is

457
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,319
maybe i don't want to fiddle with a

458
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,240
whole bunch of settings

459
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,480
maybe i want to literally walk around

460
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,919
while i'm spinning

461
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,000
this is a very similar type of spindle

462
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,520
except whereas the one in the picture

463
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:33,919
there

464
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,760
is meant to be you supported this one

465
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,120
has a little hook

466
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,799
so i can literally spin while i'm

467
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,240
walking around

468
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,400
the lightest spinning wheel in the world

469
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,039
is not going to be that flexible of a

470
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,360
tool

471
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,760
so sometimes the right tool for your job

472
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,600
is a giant tool suite

473
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,280
sometimes it's a tiny command line

474
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,720
script that does one

475
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,320
thing extremely well and don't neglect

476
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:58,960
tools

477
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,320
that only make things easier for example

478
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,640
you can see a picture of a wrist mounted

479
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,080
pin cushion

480
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,039
while the pin cushion doesn't directly

481
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,400
lend itself to

482
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,280
sewing or ironing or any of those tasks

483
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:13,679
just

484
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,760
not having to chase down a pin cushion

485
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,679
that might have rolled away

486
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,799
made sewing at scale so much

487
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,840
easier and as you're deciding

488
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,840
what tools right for the job you have to

489
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,360
understand how stuff

490
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,120
works you don't know if you're using the

491
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,039
right tool if you don't know

492
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,280
all of the intricacies of that tool and

493
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,400
the environment

494
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,000
you're trying to put the tool into

495
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,039
so a few final thoughts just to kind of

496
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,520
wrap everything up

497
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,840
most of you probably learned something

498
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,280
about textiles

499
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,640
in the span of this talk and if you're

500
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,480
as big a textile nerd as me and you

501
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,720
didn't learn something about textiles

502
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,799
you probably saw them in a new light

503
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,160
because even

504
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,799
as much as i have been sewing and

505
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:01,679
crocheting

506
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,480
since i was a child i never thought

507
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,480
about them in terms of computer security

508
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,000
until this spring and that's really the

509
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,960
idea here that no matter what the field

510
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,520
is

511
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,840
there's something you can learn from it

512
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,280
and there's something that you can learn

513
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,080
from the people

514
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,400
in that field a lot of the people that

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400

world

518
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,160
and so take the time to stop and learn

519
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,720
something

520
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,720
from their experience because there's a

521
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,120
lot of fundamental truths

522
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,120
that you can learn even from a

523
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,840
