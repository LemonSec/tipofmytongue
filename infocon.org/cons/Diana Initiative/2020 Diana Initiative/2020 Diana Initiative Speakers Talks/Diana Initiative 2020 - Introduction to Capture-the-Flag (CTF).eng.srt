73
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,519
duration of the conference

74
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,680
um i have a tiny url there but it's

75
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,680
basically the try hack me site

76
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,720
and you just need to create an account

77
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,200
and then it'll ask you for like a code

78
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,239
to join a room

79
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,720
and you can just type in that diana

80
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,160
initiative ctf

81
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,599
um so jump into the challenges or if you

82
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,519
want a little extra assistance

83
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,519
attend the workshop that jay's giving

84
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,120
where we will be doing some sneak

85
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,640
preview walkthroughs of some of the

86
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,760
challenges

87
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,599
and and go from there so

88
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,599
so how you play so try hack me is set up

89
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,480
for

90
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,680
individual play only if you want to do

91
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,080
team

92
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,120
play you would have to create a team

93
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,920
amongst you and whoever else and then

94
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,440
use a shared login

95
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,920
so i always reluctant to say use a

96
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,280
shared login as i

97
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,560
have in the picture there what could

98
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,560
possibly go wrong but

99
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,799
in this case that's the only way to to

100
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,120
have a team

101
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,519
so for support during the um the ctf

102
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,560
you can reach out to our volunteer team

103
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,680
in the capture the flag village um

104
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,319
and just do chat there if you have like

105
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,760
specific questions

106
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,200
send a direct message um to me or one of

107
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,400
the other admins

108
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,080
um i'm in there as literally ctf admin

109
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,560
um and we'll announce other volunteers

110
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,200
as they're

111
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,080
on hand um we're only going to be doing

112
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,360
like official support during the

113
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,480
conference hours so

114
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,760
if it's in the middle of the night and

115
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,760
you're stuck on a question we probably

116
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,840
won't be able to help you but

117
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,079
i am always happy to see the evolution

118
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,160
of chat between the different players

119
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,279
and um and uh you know helping each

120
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,120
other and stuff like that so

121
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,120
anyway um and you can also create your

122
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,720
own breakout sessions

123
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,800
within that room so if you have like a

124
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,440
team you can have a little team group

125
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,560
and so on and so forth okay

126
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,199
so winners and prizes there will be both

127
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:37,600
um

128
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,520
we are actually still working out prizes

129
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,800
because we're getting

130
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,360
new things coming in like as we speak so

131
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,199
none of that will be announced until

132
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,160
tomorrow

133
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,280
um one thing to note is if you

134
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,040
decide to go the team route and you have

135
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,720
like 20 people on your team

136
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,960
everybody will not get a prize i wish i

137
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,479
could say price for you price for use

138
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,440
price for you but

139
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,880
it's not going to work that way it'll be

140
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,039
limited so you'll have to divvy them

141
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,479
up amongst yourselves so

142
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,520
that's it um let's get going and do some

143

203
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,199
studying with them i was able to change

204
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,160
the change career path by um working

205
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,520
with them and studying for

206
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,720
the um the security plus

207
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,080
and that as you know is history

208
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,400
um right now they have over 5 000

209
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,120
members

210
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,160
um we're all over the us and we even

211
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,440
have some international members

212
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,360
uh what is a ctf today we're here to

213
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,400
learn about

214
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,240
capture the flags the original meaning

215
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,440
came from

216
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,440
capturing the enemy's flag during the

217
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,360
battle you know during war or whatnot

218
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,599
um except for that we haven't had enough

219
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,399
of those but

220
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,799
in infosec um if cyber is

221
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,559
capture the flag refer to competition

222
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,040
where you get to solve scavenger like um

223
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,839
challenges

224
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,120
or puzzles and your main goal is to

225
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,120
find a vulnerability that will lead to

226
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,720
something

227
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,440
something to compromise the system so um

228
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,760
think of the ctf as a practice to what

229
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,200
you're doing in the real world

230
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:09,839
um who can play um

231
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,720
for the short answer plain is for anyone

232
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,320
you want to um

233
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,000
you want to join in so i'm trying not to

234
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,399
read

235
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,160
the the little things that are coming up

236
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,600
on the screen um

237
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,000
playing this for um for anyone is for

238
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,640
students

239
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,399
then they're usually the target

240
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,399
audiences you have professionals will

241
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,360
play these

242
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,200
you have companies and um

243
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,320
companies will put out in ctfs as a

244
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,279
potential um way to find new hires

245
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,200
and there's challenges anywhere from

246
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,839
beginners to advanced

247
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,080
um why should you play because it's fun

248
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,680
i mean like

249
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,200
you're you're doing puzzles you're

250
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
solving challenges and

251
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,279
sometimes you get a whole lot of money

252
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,399
to do this

253
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,079
so it's a way for you to build your

254
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,760
skills um

255
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,839
is a great way to learn things some

256
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,360
people are tactile learners some are

257
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,800
audible learners you can go and listen

258
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,560
to a lecture and walk out of there be an

259
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,360
expert

260
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,920
but for a lot of folks you need the

261
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,800
hands on

262
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,040
for retaining the knowledge and i'm one

263
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,240
of those so i

264
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,480
i like doing the ctf because it helped

265
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,600
me remember

266
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,640
all the things that i'm learning um

267
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,680
by hand okay it's also great for resume

268
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,120
building when you don't have

269
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,640
experience you know when you get those

270
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,600
job um those job listings that want you

271
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,680
to come with 100 years of experience

272
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,399
before

273
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,200
you've even graduated use your ctf

274
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,839
challenges

275
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,399
at your ctf experience as a form of

276
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,959
experience

277
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,560
now i bet you had a lot of excuses

278
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,760
i did too before i started uh you know

279
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,959
i'd rather watch

280
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,000
um i've never done this before i

281
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,959
don't know enough yet i don't want to

282
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,560
hold back the others because you know

283
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,079
people are faster and they know what

284
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,279
they're doing

285
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,680
and i don't know where to start well

286
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,399
start here

287
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,240
um i'll tell you a little bit about my

288
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,720
first competition funny thing is i don't

289
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,560
remember much about the competition

290
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,680
except for the fact that i had

291
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,360
in the back of my mind that everybody

292
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,880
else on the competition were better than

293
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,920
me because they have been in

294
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,839
competitions before

295
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,440
however we were all still learning and

296
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,680
we had a challenge where we needed to go

297
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,640
in and

298
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,200
we were trying to elevate our privileges

299
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,800
and we thought we needed to change

300
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,839
the config files and somehow we

301
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,480
ended up changing permissions and locked

302
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,079
ourselves out of the system and that was

303
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,519
the end of the game for us

304
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,320
we couldn't log in um and we couldn't we

305
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,000
couldn't play

306
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,160
lesson learned but that didn't stop me

307
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,120
because i

308
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,320
i left with i left fired up wanting to

309
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:58,720
do

310
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,800
another challenge to do better the next

311
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,040
time

312
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,079
so you know you get a ctf you get a ctf

313
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,240
everybody gets a ctf

314
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,279
um cts are team based or individual they

315
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,920
can be in person or you know our new

316
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,720
normal is

317
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,200
remote and they can be timed or

318
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,079
open-ended

319
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,480
and from noob to advanced you have all

320
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,600
sorts of

321
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,720
you know something for everyone

322
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,800
there are different and different

323
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,880
categories of challenges

324
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,480
now you can be you know you can try to

325
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,920
be jack of all trades

326
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,320
master of none or you can form a team

327
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,399
where you have somebody who is an expert

328
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,160
in something in each of these

329
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,000
or you can choose just to focus on one

330
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,920
area and let that be your expertise

331
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,600
you have cryptography for those who like

332
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,839
to solve puzzles and crack codes

333
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,920
you have stick and average steganography

334
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,440
for those who like to

335
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,760
solve you know figure out a way to find

336
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,680
images or

337
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,920
images and files out of other images and

338
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,880
files

339
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,279
um you have reverse engineering for

340
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,800
binary and exploiting

341
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,120
binary files you have web application

342
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,320
pen testing

343
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,360
for those who are um

344
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,720
um since everybody is in the cloud

345
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,360
you're on the web a lot of the a lot of

346
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,160
the

347
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,720
attacks will come in through that and to

348
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,639
that manner so it's a it's a great

349
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,480
skill to have um you can do the um

350
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,880
the the route to boot type of challenges

351
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,320
or where you own the system

352
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,120
upon the system you can do network

353
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,720
traffic analysis which is part of

354
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,480
digital forensics where you're going

355
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:34,959
through

356
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,760
uh pcap files to find data that's

357
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,800
exposed

358
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,440
and that have been captured in um in am

359
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,800
on text

360
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,279
then with the digital forensics you can

361
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,360
do everything from the memory analysis

362
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,199
to um drive and disk drive analysis

363
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,440
and then you have your specialty type of

364
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,680
events where it's the wireless uh

365
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,399
old synth which is open and open source

366
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,279
intelligence

367
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,120
you have trivia sorts and where it's

368
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,639
just basically

369
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,560
googling the heck out of stuff and then

370
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,760
social engineering

371
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,560
which is uh more of a specialty type

372
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,000
thing where you are

373
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,120
a lot of times it's set up as a um

374
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,519
a live event where you're calling a

375
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,480
vision or

376
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,519
trying to get information from people um

377
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,360
during a live um a live phone call

378
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,600
um that brings me into the next one

379
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,279
where your types of competition you will

380
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,240
have are the

381
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,720
jeopardy where is it it can be a group

382
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,240
of puzzles you have

383
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,000
attack defense mission-based type

384
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,480
challenges a hybrid which is just

385
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,160
exactly what it sounds like it's a mix

386
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,360
of

387
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,000
or two or more and then you have your

388
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,720
specialty

389
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,160
challenges all right

390
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,199
um for the offense

391
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,800
attack uh defense

392
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,240
you have those are usually

393
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,000
for i i don't want to say elite teams

394
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,480
but they

395
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,399
they're usually really hard to get into

396
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,839
when i've looked for them anyway they

397
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:08,560
tend to be

398
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,120
like a specially focused or a smaller

399
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,160
type challenge

400
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,079
where you have to qualify to get to that

401
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,199
like def con has

402
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,120
their big one where people and do

403
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,040
qualifications all year long

404
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,480
and then you have some of the ones that

405
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,079
are listed on here

406
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,480
with the cyber defense competition and

407
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,760
whatnot

408
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,880
your your goal is to

409
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,440
lock down your system while attacking

410
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:31,920
your

411
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,800
opponent usually everybody has the exact

412
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,720
same systems that are given to them

413
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,480
and it's just a matter of how fast you

414
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,959
can be in locking down your system while

415
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:41,600
trying to

416
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,079
uh compromise those vulnerabilities you

417
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,279
find on your system

418
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,680
during the event yeah

419
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,440
for the jeopardy style um

420
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,079
it's it's set up like jeopardy except

421
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,519
you don't have to answer in the form of

422
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,560
a question

423
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,519
you have um you have each each category

424
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,000
will have a point system

425
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,160
um depending on the and depending on the

426
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,839
challenge depending on this difficulty

427
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:08,480
you have

428
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,160
um everything from a 25 point

429
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,240
question which might be your easy and

430
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,519
then a hundred point question which

431
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,800
might be a difficult

432
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,880
um and challenge so

433
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,720
that's the kind you will usually see

434
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,560
that's that's similar to what you will

435
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,360
see today

436
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,360
we have like uh we have a hybrid of a

437
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,399
jeopardy and

438
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,680
uh um hacked the box type challenge

439
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,399
the mission-based um challenges um i've

440
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,839
seen them with kaizen i've seen them

441
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,399
with

442
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,680
kringle khan which used to be called

443
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,680
holiday hack it is

444
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,360
based on um a scenario you're given

445
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,160
a story a storyboard so to speak where

446
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,120
you

447
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,880
you work your way through the story and

448
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,800
each question you solve

449
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,279
is going to point you to the next and

450
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,720
the next answer you need

451
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,120
so you you sometimes won't even know how

452
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,800
many questions you have to solve on the

453
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,680
entire

454
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,720
um ctf board questions are reviewed as

455
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,280
you're going through it

456
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,720
all right um for the hybrid is a mix

457
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,959
of them all and most most competitions

458
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,079
tend to be hybrid

459
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,679
like i said for today you're gonna be

460
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,160
doing um jeopardy style questions you're

461
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,119
gonna have your

462
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,000
your your google phone challenges you're

463
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,919
gonna have your pcaps and everything

464
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,319
else

465
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,799
but then you'll also have some um some

466
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,119
hack-to-box boxes where you're gonna

467
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,440
log into the box and then try to elevate

468
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,360
your privileges

469
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,320
and find the flag sorry um for the

470
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,760
specialty challenges

471
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,360
um ctf at derby oh ctrl

472
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,640
sactf derby is no longer around and

473
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,280
dc3 is no longer around but there were

474
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,520
specialty challenges dc3 was all about

475
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,640
digital forensics and um

476
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,080
the scctf at derby con

477
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,640
sects still happens it's usually at

478
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,280
defcon

479
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,440
and this year they didn't do it but

480
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,720
um it's it's you're given

481
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,080
a company and over a three week prior to

482
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,679
the event time you

483
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,720
go and gather information on it

484
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,640
and then you come back and do a live

485
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,559
call while everybody is watching you in

486
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:16,880
the

487
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,960
in the choir booth then you have the

488
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,919
wall of sheep

489
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,799
for the packet detective um that's also

490
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,480
held at def con where

491
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,960
you have pcap packages that you're being

492
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,600
given

493
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,160
and you're going through sifting through

494
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,600
to see if you can find anybody playing

495
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,960
text password

496
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,160
in the in the data um hopefully it's

497
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,240
hopelessly broken is another challenge

498
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,520
that has to do with

499
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,720
iot devices mainly routers and then you

500
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,320
have the trace labs which is

501
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,039
um relatively new and it's all about it

502
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,240
helping

503
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,120
helping real help in real time to find

504
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,720
people that are actually missing so it's

505
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,240
not just a game

506
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,400
but it is a way to actually help your

507
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,799
fellow human

508
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,080
um now a slight detour from the um

509
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,799
from the capture the flag you'll hear

510
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,480
some people refer to capture the flag as

511
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:06,880
a

512
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,960
hackathon it's not the same thing

513
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,559
agathon is basically

514
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,640
where the the vulnerabilities have

515
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,000
already been found

516
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,960
and now you gather your you know your

517
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,160
brightest and best

518
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,720
programmers to come together and solve

519
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,840
whatever

520
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,640
problems you're having you're and doing

521
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,440
a sprint

522
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,280
is usually wrapped around the cars and

523
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,640
i've seen them where

524
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,120
they're doing them for uh you know a

525
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,360
company will have like a particular

526
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,760
um item that they're putting out and

527
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,600
let's say a drone for example

528
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
and they want to make sure that those

529
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,200
are going to be secure from someone

530
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,480
trying to take it over

531
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,120
so you have a hackathon and you bring in

532
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,760
all your

533
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,520
your vulnerabilities and then tell

534
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,160
people hey have at it let's fix this

535
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,039
problem

536
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,320
or let's brainstorm to fix the problem

537
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,280
okay and then back to ctf how do you

538
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,000
prepare

539
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,200
you want to get your 18 together

540
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,000
you want to find like-minded individuals

541
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,400
i

542
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,840
also like to find people who are who are

543
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,080
specializing in other fields than what i

544
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,880
know because i know that i can't be

545
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,799
good at everything so i want to find

546
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,320
people who are better than me

547
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,440
at other things

548
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,840
oh that ain't lose you i almost lost

549
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,480
myself

550
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,440
anyways you find like-minded individuals

551
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,760
you want to find a focus area

552
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,960
and hone your skills um i i'll

553
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,960
i'll tend to pick a type of challenge

554
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,960
and solve that for a few weeks

555
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,760
and then either i get stuck a lot more

556
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,640
and i get

557
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,640
or i get bored and then i move on to

558
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,559
something else but i want to do that

559
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,480
particular thing until i feel like i'm

560
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,400
pretty comfortable at it even if i'm not

561
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,760
the expert

562
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,400
then you'll want to build your home lab

563
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,280
um

564
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,280
because it is illegal for you to go and

565
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,600
hack at things that you don't own

566
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,919
build yourself a lab or join something

567
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,240
like the tri-acme

568
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,080
platform where you can go and they have

569
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,600
a lot of um

570
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,760
vulnerable machines that you can log

571
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,720
into and

572
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,520
hack and not worry about any legal

573
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,039
repercussions because you

574
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,320
found something you weren't supposed to

575
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,159
be looking for you

576
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,840
you want to develop your toolkit

577
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,520
basically a set of tools that you're

578
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,799
going to be using

579
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,919
um to make your your ctf

580
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,120
a lot smoother and then you want to read

581
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,760
and research

582
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,240
walkthroughs a lot of the challenges you

583
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,840
see will repeat

584
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,360
after time and if you have a

585
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,000
if you have your if you've read through

586
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,360
the walkthroughs

587
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,640
then it's not so it's not so daunting

588
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,400
and new to you and even if you're in the

589
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,000
middle of a challenge and you can't

590
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,520
figure out what to do

591
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,440
if you google you might end up with a

592
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,960
walkthrough that sounds similar to what

593
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,760
you're looking for

594
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,840
and that way you can help build your

595
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,240
skills

596
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,159
um for building your home lab you need a

597
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,280
virtual machine

598
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,840
uh a hypervisor that you're gonna run

599
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,559
your other

600
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,440
operating systems on top of you want

601
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:07,840
your

602
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,480
attacker box you can it can be a kali

603
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,200
linux

604
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,520
pen tool you got security dojo and many

605
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,120
other types out there

606
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,840
um and you need target boxes that you're

607
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,200
gonna exploit you can do

608
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,720
the metasploitable um some older windows

609
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,039
um distributions which you can find at

610
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,080
the microsoft site

611
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,320
that they have available you can do

612
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,679
other linux distribution

613
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,000
and you can go to vonhob where they have

614
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,360
a lot of

615
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,440
vulnerable boxes that you can go and

616
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,080
practice on

617
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,440
in our toolkit excuse the noise for a

618
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,240
second time

619
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,280
all right google stay with me

620
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,200
google google is your friend

621
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,400
there's you know they're invasive they

622
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:56,720
get

623
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
um you know they get into everything but

624
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,159
they are your friend when it comes to

625
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,600
hacking

626
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,919
i google pretty much everything that i

627
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,159
can't find and then if i don't google i

628
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,720
don't do it but it's the same deal

629
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,240
all right the um the internet is it's a

630
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,000
playground for you to find

631
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,720
it it's also somewhere for you to get

632
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,960
let down the rabbit hole looking at the

633
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,400
videos but other than that

634
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,240
it's like you want to use google to find

635
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,000
the things that you need to help you

636
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,039
um myself github link i posted here she

637
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:29,440
has

638
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,039
a lot of um a lot of links of places you

639
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,080
can go and do it

640
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,720
and to help solve a lot of the problems

641
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,480
especially when it comes to doing like

642
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:38,880
the

643
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,880
the the binary um that's not just binary

644
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,799
sorry to do any of the decrypting the

645
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,000
the

646
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,760
cryptography or doing like password um

647
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,880
and and stuff she has links to those if

648
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,000
you go to her github

649
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,760
she has like a link to a google file

650
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,360
that you can then um

651
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,799
follow along um for the basic tool set

652
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:01,840
you want a

653
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,200
text editor and a hex editor

654
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,039
wireshark and a lot of these are built

655
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,640
into the cali

656
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,559
operating system you you know for pen

657
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,240
testing you want the end map your birth

658
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,720
suite which is what you use to capture

659
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,960
um the the traffic before it goes to the

660
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,960
website you know for you to stop in

661
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,159
and and edit things in in

662
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,760
live when you're trying to mess with the

663
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,240
website uh metasploit for

664
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,159
doing your um your easy exploitation

665
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,880
on boxes um if you if you're really good

666
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,799
you can go ahead and write your own with

667
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,720
and mfs venom or one of the other

668
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,000
uh exploit type

669
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,440
but these are the easy to go

670
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,720
the easy go to sorry

671
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,960
um

672
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,880
now we're at the part where we do the

673
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,080
walkthroughs

674
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,520
um first i can take some questions

675
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,240
um let's see here

676
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,440

721
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:17,360
um yes okay i just need to find a

722
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,120
diana initiative because i have too many

723
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,880
rooms you have a lot of rooms

724
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,320
if you've been using try hack me a lot

725
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,279
let's see there it is

726
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,919
all right i'm gonna leave and okay

727
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,360
alrighty okay let's see here i gotta

728
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,919
figure out which problem i'm doing here

729
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,520
because we're walking through the

730
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,960
if you if you have the slides we're

731
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,320
walking through the

732
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,919
cryptography and we're gonna be doing

733
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,399
problem

734
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:54,000
number seven from task

735
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,320
one

736
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,000
so right here is the

737
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,559
problem that we have and right now it

738
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,480
just looks like a bunch of

739
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,559
numbers and you remember i was talking

740
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,080
about myself

741
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,399
um files this is the list

742
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,679
of all of the links that she has

743
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,279
and for the one that we have it looks

744
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,600
like

745
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,799
we're gonna be using to ask you to text

746
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,000
because it looks like

747
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,640
decimals

748
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,720
in the try hack me here so

749
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,000
first thing we want to do in this case

750
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,039
is copy what we have

751
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,399
and you can also use the hints

752
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,360
don't make my screen bigger how i don't

753
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:59,840
know how to make the screen bigger i'm

754
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,840
ah

755
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:26,399
okay is that bigger

756
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,879
i can

757
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,720
like that's as big as i can get it

758
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,799
because i'm in the vm the vm is not

759
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:39,760
going to get any

760
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,880
it's not going to get it any bigger so

761
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,880
um sorry about that um in try hack me

762
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,880
with many of these problems we have

763
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,279
hints for you to be able to solve

764
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,440
so if you click the hint on this one it

765
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,399
tells you

766
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,440
it's a decimal to ascii type uh

767
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,279
problem so we copy the

768
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,880
the number go to the ask you to hex

769
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,080
and then oh gosh it's not it's not

770
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,559
changing

771
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,399
ah

772
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,840
hold on i'm

773
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,520
trying to figure out how to sorry

774
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,840
um

775
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,720
supposed to be the whole cali box

776
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,440
and i want

777
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,159
it's it's leaving the screen and um

778
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,960
and that traffic there we go that's

779
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,000
better

780
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,080
so now we've got it going back and forth

781
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,760
so here's the decimal

782
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,440
in here while we

783
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,519
when we paste

784
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,200
our value that we got from the try hack

785
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:07,919
me

786
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,440
and hit convert up here

787
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,720
it has this link

788
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,480
this question that you now have to

789
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,159
answer and the question

790
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,840
basically says if you get there we go

791
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,799
can you see then okay the question says

792
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,600
what year

793
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,000
was diana initiative uh what's the first

794
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,080
diana initiative conference

795
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,640
so now if you've been with dynamite

796
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,159
mission for a while

797
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,840
you might know this off the top of your

798
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,679
head but if you don't

799
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,799
then you go to

800
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,840
the interwebs and i went to diana

801
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,840
initiative

802
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,600
here we go and um when you go into that

803
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,320
about

804
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,159
let's see here

805
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:15,840
about the faqs is god

806
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,200
let's see here

807
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,240
there we go about the na initiative

808
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,399
and as you read through it it tells you

809
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:36,320
in in 2005 they got together

810
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,960
for def con the 22 but they weren't

811
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,679
called

812
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,440
diana initiative yet then um they had

813
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,480
their first event in 2016

814
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,039
and diana initiative was in fact was

815
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:49,840
informed

816
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,279
until 2017. so then you go back to

817
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:58,640
try hack me and type in 2017

818
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,200
if it would let me type in 2017 there we

819
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,440
go

820
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,960
and submit and you see your answer is

821
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,720
correct well

822
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,679
and you move on to your next um to the

823
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,600
next question let's see here for the

824
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,918
next

825
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,960
walkthrough we have um marcel

826
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,440
is going to be doing a packet analysis

827
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,240
so i'll stop sharing my screen

828
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,720
and she's going to hop on to do that

829
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,080
excel are you there there

830
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,279

831
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,440
between the ctf village room and

832
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,320
this room is a multitasker a woman

833
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,919
things are happening thanks for doing

834
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,519
that walkthrough that was great

835
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,080
um so i'm going to share my screen

836
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,799
here we go

837
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,360
okay so the first thing i'm going to

838
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,560
show is um

839
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,119
the try hack me platform so just a a

840
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:11,760
couple of

841
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,000
quick things on this um we're getting a

842
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,599
lot of questions about just sort of

843
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,599
operationally how these vms work and

844
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,639
things like that

845
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,040
please note that there is a help button

846
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,839
right here

847
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:25,040
that will probably answer most questions

848
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,560
that you would have

849
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,760
um our team are the ones who built the

850
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,719
challenges

851
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,119
um we didn't build the platform so so

852
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,399
start here if you have questions about

853
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,159
how the platform actually works

854
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,320
and uh and then hit us up in the ctf

855
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,760
village chat if you have specific

856
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,199
questions about

857
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,000
um the challenges themselves and if

858
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,599
you've dm me a question

859
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,918
i will get back to you i'm just working

860
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:49,918
on this other stuff right now so

861
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:53,839
anyway so so there's that um

862
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:58,480
we have a variety of different tasks as

863
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,359
you can see

864
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,839
and jay i think just walked through a

865
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:02,640
crypto one

866
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,119
i'm gonna walk through a challenge from

867
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,400
the forensics

868
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,680
category here so um

869
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,280
and there's a side note too if you have

870
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,880
a question about a challenge make sure

871
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,000
you tell us like which

872
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,720
task it is and which question it is so

873
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,079
like for example

874
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,119
i'm gonna do task four and

875
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,480
i'm going to do let's see

876
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,040
um i'm gonna do a walkthrough on this

877
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,839
one question about

878
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:32,400
bob.pcap.org so these are links to the

879
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,480
actual files you can download them

880
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,880
um just it's off of google drive if

881
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,720
there's a link that's broken let us know

882
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,599
about that but

883
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:40,960
um i think we've checked through

884
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,720
everything so

885
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,200
so you're going to download this file

886
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,760
from the google drive link

887
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,040
i already have it so i'm not going to

888
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,200
download it again but but just so you

889
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,880
can see how that works

890
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,480
and this is the same with any of the

891
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,079
files the vms

892
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,040
are different um but again refer back to

893
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,359
the

894
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,680
the help on on how to navigate through

895
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,720
that

896
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,079
um all right so i'm going to

897
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,440
share my wireshark screen and uh

898
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,520
and we're going to answer this question

899
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,880
how many ping requests

900
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,599
were sent in this capture which is a

901
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:20,720
easy-ish

902
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,359
one to answer but uh we'll step through

903
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:26,079
it anyway so let me switch over to that

904
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,480
screen

905
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,119
all right so um let's see

906
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,200
can i make this a little bigger yes i

907
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,119
can

908
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,320
so when i'm looking at a packet capture

909
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,800
um and this will help you with all of

910
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,000
the questions right

911
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,040
um i typically will start with the

912
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,560
the menu bar statistics and

913
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,119
i'd like to start with looking at the

914
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,880
protocol hierarchy

915
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,480
so that just popped up in another window

916
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,119
bear with me while i drag this over

917
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,000
there we go

918
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,520
and this is kind of small i don't know

919
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,200
how to make that bigger but

920
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,520
but you can try it on your own too and

921
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,880
this will show us all the

922
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,800
the protocols that are in play in this

923
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,960
network traffic capture

924
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,800
and so the particular question where

925
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,079
we're asking

926
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,320
here is how many ping requests there

927
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,320
were i can kind of scroll down through

928
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,000
here and see if i see any

929
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,560
ping traffic i do there's internet

930
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,320
control message protocol

931
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,680
icmp aka ping

932
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,760
um if i want to i can just filter

933
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,520
directly from here

934
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,560
but we can see that there's 12

935
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,240
ping packets so let's apply that as a

936
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,359
filter

937
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,078
selected

938
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,119
and press the manifesto up here this is

939
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,160
your filter bar

940
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,359
at the top um we

941
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,720
see all that icmp traffic

942
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,760
but that's not just the requests right

943
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,880
so if you drill down into the actual

944
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,839
protocol here

945
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,920
in the middle pane which is the packet

946
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,200
details pane

947
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,200
i can get this to cooperate yes so

948
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,680
we can see this is all like the header

949
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,359
information for the packet

950
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,720
and type 8 is

951
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,079
a ping request so we can drill down

952
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:24,000
further on these packets which i can do

953
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,320
by right clicking here saying apply as a

954
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,040
filter

955
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,000
selected and now i have a filter that's

956
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,119
icmp

957
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,079
type equals eight which is the code for

958
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,440
ping request

959
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,800
and we see one two three four five

960
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,520
six ping request messages which makes

961
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,880
sense since there was 12

962
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,240
altogether so ping response requests

963
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,320
so on and so forth so let's go back over

964
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,640
here and

965
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,720
put that answer in and hopefully it'll

966
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,560
be right

967
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,040
submit yay our answer is correct

968
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,599
so that's a a quick wireshark work

969
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:02,240
walkthrough

970
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,359
um we might do more of these later

971
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:08,160
so uh so stay tuned but i'm gonna pass

972
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,400
it back to jay so she can

973
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,320
cue up the next oh

974
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,079
i'm i'm the next person okay

975
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,119
so you can kill yourself yeah

976
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,680
one more and then i'll be chewing on i

977
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,400
think that

978
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,400
is going to be the one following that

979
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,119
but yes

980
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,800
let's see if i can do the screen thing

981
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,520
prayed again

982
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,599
hold on hold on this is gonna do

983
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,760
something stupid i don't want it to do

984
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,839
okay

985
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,520
sorry too many times and try hackneys

986
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,839
all right so for the next problem we're

987
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:04,319
doing

988
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:07,920
a walkthrough of a forensics um

989
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,920
what is it metadata um problem

990
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,160
and we're going to be doing the wildlife

991
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,440
um

992
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,200
who is the owner of wild of this

993
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,599
wildlife uh jpeg

994
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:24,319
um let's see here if i can zoom in

995
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:27,280
can you see that a little better

996
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,880
hopefully you can see that

997
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,280
a lot better first thing you want to do

998
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,560
is download

999
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,200
your image generally when you get a

1000
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,720
question like this is they're looking

1001
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,880
for the metadata in the picture

1002
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,160
um i downloaded i clicked the link

1003
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,319
and it opened up i then downloaded the

1004
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,520
picture

1005
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,079
and i've already downloaded it so i

1006
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,599
won't do it again

1007
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,839
and then you can go online and look for

1008
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:53,200
an xf tool

1009
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,319
um an xf2

1010
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:59,520
um online and

1011
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,280
let's see here jeff jeffrey image meta

1012
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,000
viewer

1013
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,800
is one of the most popular ones i will

1014
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,560
just need to browse to the image

1015
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,960
my download file and here's the wildlife

1016
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,560
jpeg

1017
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,119
then i make sure he knows that i'm not a

1018
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,119
robot

1019
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,480
uh i am a robot

1020
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,680
i can't see this right oh no okay here

1021
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,119
we go

1022
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:34,319
and then view the image data

1023
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:37,520
and now we scroll to find

1024
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,040
the user and the owner if i zoom in on

1025
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,720
here so you can see this better

1026
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,680
you will see that there's the exit data

1027
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,480
and

1028
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,880
whoa there we go the owner's name is

1029
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,680
wiley

1030
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:56,079
coyote and i copy that

1031
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,200
take that to the try hack me paste it

1032
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,880
and you can see you have a hint here

1033
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,319
that already tells you

1034
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:05,280
that the owners names got a period in it

1035
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,960
a lot of time on try hacking

1036
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,400
the the the hint for the answer is gonna

1037
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:10,960
have

1038
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,680
the the slashes are gonna be put in your

1039
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,280
periods and commas

1040
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,040
are usually going to be put in and then

1041
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,760
you have to fill in the rest

1042
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,000
so paste that

1043
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,520
should we should we check the hint to

1044
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,280
see if we did the right thing

1045
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,440
all right we did that it says access

1046
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,280
data use the actual viewing tool and

1047
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,319
look for the owner's

1048
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,359
name field and we did that so

1049
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:38,560
we hit submit and we got this now before

1050
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,119
we go

1051
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,200
i want to show you that there's also an

1052
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,359
exif viewer tool within

1053
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,598
um

1054
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,599
within cali that's built in uh sometimes

1055
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:55,040
you have to install it

1056
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,240
so if i cd to my download folder

1057
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,960
um i don't know can you see this let's

1058
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,359
see

1059
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:06,078
plus nope that doesn't work

1060
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:12,000
let's see here i think i can zoom nope

1061
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,920
i am so sorry for this there we go

1062
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,000
all right and i want to do xf

1063
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,520
tool and do it to the wildlife

1064
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,119
jpeg and it gives me that same

1065
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,480
information right here the owner's

1066
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,680
name and you would then paste it in and

1067
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,680
voila so right now we're gonna move on

1068
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,720
to

1069
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,440
tabby and she's gonna do the walkthrough

1070
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,640
of one of the

1071
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:55,119
web uh pen testing challenges

1072
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:59,440
okay okay stop sharing and

1073
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,040
leave awesome

1074
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,760
so all right so i'm sharing my screen

1075
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,880
over here i'm

1076
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:12,079
logged into the room for the try hack me

1077
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:15,599
and we are going to look at

1078
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,440
this one here which is pickle rick

1079
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,880
so totally full disclosure i

1080
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,720
went through this challenge like a month

1081
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,680
and a half ago when i was uh qaing it

1082
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,160
and i don't remember anything at all so

1083
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,520
you're gonna get the like

1084
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,800
real experience of how this happens

1085
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,480
so first thing we're going to need to do

1086
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,000
is deploy the vm

1087
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,480
so we click deploy tells us this little

1088
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,720
message starting your vm

1089
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,760
um vm has started real fast

1090
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,280
so now in a minute it's going to show us

1091
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,520
uh the ip address of the machine that

1092
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,119
we're going to need to try to break into

1093
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,640
here

1094
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,640
while we're waiting on that we're going

1095
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,920
to figure out what we're going to need

1096
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,839
to do to access that machine

1097
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,480
so there's two different ways if you

1098
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,040
have

1099
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,319
not purchased a try hack me

1100
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:09,040
subscription but you are using a free

1101
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,960
account then you can connect with

1102
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,960
openvpn and so we will set that up here

1103
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,160
while we're waiting

1104
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,760
i'm going to say let's do us

1105
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,640
east regular one let's say download my

1106
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,359
configuration file

1107
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:28,640
yeah i want to save it i want to save it

1108
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:28,960
in

1109
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,160
slash temp i like to make a

1110
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,720
directory on my computer for files

1111
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,520
related to

1112
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,800
a ctf challenge that i'm working on now

1113
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,920
i happen to be running linux

1114
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,160
which makes this whole openvpn thing

1115
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,480
really easy to use

1116
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,200
because it's already installed you see

1117
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,240
they give you this

1118
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:54,399
file with information in it and i can

1119
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,599
i can launch openvpn like this

1120
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:05,040
and it'll connect

1121
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,680
there we go and i'll put this unreadably

1122
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,280
small window into the background and

1123
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,960
i'll just sit there and run

1124
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,240
while we're still waiting for our

1125
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,880
machine to boot up we'll also look if

1126
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:15,599
you have

1127
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,720
paid for a try hack me subscription you

1128
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,640
can also do

1129
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,319
a browser-based

1130
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:27,599
kali linux vm so that you don't need to

1131
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:28,000
deal

1132
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,280
with getting openvpn working but uh

1133
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,880
openvpn does work on windows mac linux

1134
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,880
and there's directions on the tryhackme

1135
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,400
site for how to do it

1136
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,960
but if you're a subscriber then also you

1137
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,160
can do this thing with the

1138
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,160
with me in browser colli vm whatever

1139
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,319
works easier for you

1140
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,599
so i need to get back to

1141
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:56,640
the room

1142
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,720
we're back here in the room and a nice

1143
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,480
thing is the vm that you've deployed

1144
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,920
doesn't go away just because you

1145
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,680
navigate away from the room

1146
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,920
that that would have been a real hassle

1147
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:06,720
right now

1148
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,920
so i'm going to go back and view the

1149
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,920
challenge here for pickle rick this rick

1150
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,440
and morty theme challenge requires you

1151
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,599
to exploit a web server

1152
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,440
deploy the virtual machine and explore

1153
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,720
the web application

1154
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,040
okay so i don't even know about web

1155
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,720
application all i've got is this ip

1156
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,280
address and copy it to the clipboard

1157
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:30,079
and i'll put it in here

1158
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:33,760
just so that i can remember it

1159
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:35,280
if i need to remember it it's right

1160
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,520
there i don't know anything about this

1161
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,559
machine

1162
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:40,800
but

1163
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,240
a good first step is usually going to be

1164
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,880
do a port scan on it with nmap and see

1165
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:49,760
what's listening

1166
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,640
so if i just call nmap dash little s big

1167
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,200
t

1168
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,040
it's going to try and do a tcp

1169
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,240
connection to

1170
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,760
each of the thousand most common ports

1171
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,520
and that usually only takes a couple of

1172
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,359
seconds all right it looks like it's

1173
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:04,000
listening

1174
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,520
for ssh connections and http

1175
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,760
so probably if we just go to this ipina

1176
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,040
browser that'll be

1177
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,480
the start that we want so we'll go into

1178
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,119
our browser

1179
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,680
and see what do we get brick is super

1180
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,920
cool listen morty i need your help

1181
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,960
i've turned myself into a pickle again

1182
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,359
and i can't change back log into my

1183
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:30,079
computer

1184
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,960
find the secret ingredients but i don't

1185
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,000
know what the password

1186
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,240
was okay very typical next step

1187
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,800
in a ctf web challenge is to view the

1188
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,119
source of the web page so let's look

1189
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:46,880
and in fact

1190
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,800
that's exactly what they wanted us to do

1191
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,599
here note to self remember username

1192
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:52,480
username

1193
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,760
rick rules so this is probably a useful

1194
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:56,720
thing

1195
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:00,839
for us to write down someone go down

1196
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:03,280
here

1197
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,640
um if you're not if you're not a linux

1198
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:07,119
person

1199
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,359
you use whatever you like but it's good

1200
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:12,000
to it's good to keep notes

1201
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,240
that way you remember what's been going

1202
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,200
on okay

1203
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,079
so unfortunately i don't see any kind of

1204
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:18,480
web

1205
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,559
application i just see this web page

1206
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,000
that's not great

1207
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,720
a common next thing to look at when

1208
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:25,599
you're looking at

1209
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:29,119
a web-based ctf challenge is

1210
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:33,359
a robots.txt file um

1211
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,400
this is weird this is not what a

1212
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,359
robots.txt looks like

1213
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:40,480
so you can find out some more

1214
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,079
about robots.txt

1215
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:46,640
come on is there a wikipedia yeah there

1216
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,200
we go

1217
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,520
robot exclusion standard we're clearly

1218
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,599
not going to read all this right now

1219
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:53,920
but we can scroll here's some examples

1220
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,200
this is what a robot

1221
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,559
txt usually looks like you say a user

1222
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:00,800
agent of a robot and what it is allowed

1223
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,440
or disallowed to go to

1224
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,000
that's not what this looks like so i'm

1225
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,599
going to guess that this is a ctf

1226
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:09,520
challenge related thing but this is

1227
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,119
probably some kind of hint

1228
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,680
so again i'm going to copy this and i'm

1229
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,760
going to paste it into my notes

1230
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,920
document here that may be useful but we

1231
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,319
still

1232
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:23,599
ain't got nothing all we've got is this

1233
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:27,200
so at this point sort of a next

1234
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,359
kind of step is to see

1235
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:34,079
can we guess other paths inside this web

1236
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:34,880
application

1237
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,480
let's see if i've got deer buster

1238
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,040
installed all right i got their buster

1239
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:39,599
installed

1240
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,960
so uh dirtbuster is a pretty commonly

1241
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,599
used

1242
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,720
web application path brute forcing tool

1243
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,720
so like it comes with a dictionary file

1244
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,800
and you can give it a url

1245
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,640
and it will start tacking the

1246
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,000
attacking the entries in the dictionary

1247
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,599
file onto the end of the url that you

1248
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:58,400
start with

1249
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,920
so it says here derby base url

1250
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,480
options so let's just

1251
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:08,720
let's just see what happens if we run

1252
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,640
this against this in a very

1253
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:23,839
naive way

1254
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,359
well that's chugging away and i'm

1255
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:34,960
feeling kind of impatient so

1256
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,040
while that's going let's go back up to

1257
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,319
our browser and just

1258
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:41,920
try guessing some things too

1259
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,240
all right pretty good guess um

1260
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,800
because i mean everybody that writes a

1261
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,800
php web app calls it uh

1262
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,240
calls it login.php right um let's see if

1263
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,040
they hit any hints for us in the page

1264
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,720
source

1265
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,319
on this one too uh no

1266
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:05,440
we don't got nothing but we do have

1267
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,319
the username

1268
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,200
and since we found a login page we're

1269
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,200
just going to cancel this doorbuster

1270
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,480
uh it says username

1271
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,599
and um uh i mean god's honest truth i i

1272
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:21,119
haven't watched this tv show but i'm

1273
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,800
gonna guess that if i had watched this

1274
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,119
tv show i'd probably recognize

1275
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:28,720
that this word dub has something to do

1276
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,079
with the tv show so

1277
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,559
probably let's just plug these into the

1278
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,160
username and password field see what we

1279
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:34,880
get

1280
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,920
i'm going to copy

1281
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,260
paste

1282
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:42,489
[Music]

1283
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,559
paste come on i need in all right

1284
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:50,960
cool so this looks good we click potions

1285
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,359
all right creatures other potions

1286
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:58,400
bath clone notes we got nothing um we

1287
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,960
had good luck with uh finding a hint on

1288
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:01,280
the

1289
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,359
page source so let's try that again

1290
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,480
anything cool

1291
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,800
in here no but we do have this box

1292
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:13,119
that says commands um so

1293
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,160
this is php maybe this is oh and the

1294
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,839
machine was running ssh so it's probably

1295
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:18,960
running linux

1296
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,520
uh hopefully we can get a little bit

1297
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:25,359
more information about that

1298
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:31,280
so telnet is like three decades it goes

1299
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,359
way of logging into a unix machine over

1300
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:35,440
the network it's unencrypted and and

1301
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,880
it's a bad idea and we shouldn't do it

1302
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,680
these days

1303
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:41,760
but it also has other handy uses to just

1304
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,079
connect to any kind of tcp service

1305
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:47,359
and so there we go um this is the ssh

1306
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:49,599
protocol handshake from this ssh server

1307
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:52,079
and it tells us that it's ubuntu so here

1308
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:53,599
we go we got this linux machine

1309
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:57,839
let's try some linux commands in here

1310
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,280
okay so we can run linux commands

1311
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,319
in this command panel we're dub dub dub

1312
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:05,359
data

1313
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:08,720
can we run ls we can run ls and here we

1314
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,000
got this file

1315
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,160
super secret pickle and greed.txt

1316
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,440
uh but note that this looks like

1317
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,559
it is the root directory for

1318
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:23,680
the website yeah so

1319
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,160
maybe we can just access super secret

1320
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,359
pickling greed

1321
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:32,078
out of the browser

1322
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:41,200
turns out i actually need this

1323
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:50,839
we got all right

1324
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:53,680
so they let us have this command

1325
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,319
panel here um we used it to list out

1326
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:57,599
some files

1327
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:00,480
and we can actually read the file um can

1328
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,079
we also read the file this way

1329
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,160
well i guess cat being disabled makes it

1330
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,400
hard for future pickle rick but

1331
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,640
uh if future pickle rick knows how to

1332
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,400
use a web browser we're probably good

1333
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,720
um i wonder if we can do some unix

1334
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,400
trickery here though

1335
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,480
uh like read sing

1336
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:27,520
redirect from this

1337
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,520
okay so if if future if future pickle

1338
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,240
rick has

1339
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,880
has been using unix for a while being

1340
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,119
cut off from uh

1341
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:40,480
from cat there isn't isn't gonna hurt

1342
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,280
him too much

1343
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,440
oh but more is disabled

1344
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,280
less works so there's a few different

1345
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,880
ways we can get the contents of this

1346
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,559
file let's copy it we're going to go

1347
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:55,280
back to the challenge i think it means

1348
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,200
the format let's paste it in and see if

1349
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,799
it likes us

1350
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:02,079
we got it so we've walked through a

1351
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:03,359
little bit of what we can do

1352
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:06,000
with the tryhackme platform ways that

1353
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,839
you can deploy machines ways that you

1354
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:08,160
can

1355
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,119
access them either by running openvpn

1356
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:11,920
locally

1357
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,839
or by going to your uh browser-based

1358
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,839
access to cali machine

1359
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:19,359
and we've done a little bit of

1360
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:20,960
enumeration poked around

1361
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,319
on a website and uh

1362
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:27,440
we got a flag out of it so i'm gonna hop

1363
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:27,920
off

1364
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,119
here and give this back to

1365
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:33,359
jay

1366
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:40,480
hi um tyrone are you around

1367
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,119
because we we've got the mother lode and

1368
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:44,000
that is the

1369
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,799
pen testing

1370
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:52,000
and he was very instrumental in building

1371
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,359
a lot of these

1372
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:55,359
and if he's not answering then you're

1373
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:59,839
going to have to do it tabby

1374
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:11,119
oh wow okay um

1375
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:13,280
we're being told to also bump up our

1376
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,640
screen

1377
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,640
sizes because they can't see the

1378
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:26,079
um they can't see the screens

1379
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:29,119
um if you can increase like the zoom

1380
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:32,160
to like maybe 125 that's what i had mine

1381
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:32,640
at

1382
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,760
um yeah was mine readable mine's 150.

1383
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,920
is it it was still really small okay

1384
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,520
well if i end up doing this next one

1385
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,720
i'll make it even bigger

1386
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,200
okay thanks yeah i don't i don't know

1387
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,799
what happened to tyrone so

1388
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:46,559
uh yeah what are we gonna do then let's

1389
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:47,839
try something

1390
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,760
let's do another challenge let's do

1391
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,240
another we've got a whole another hour

1392
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,640
before this session is done

1393
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,760
so yes don't we

1394
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:02,079
we started that said at noon oh yeah

1395
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:05,130
or nine nine we'll start at nine

1396
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:10,799
[Laughter]

1397
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:14,559
okay so um all right go ahead and take

1398
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:17,440
it you can do another floor better

1399
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,720
now okay uh tabitha can we do

1400
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,040
because there's a lot of questions being

1401
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,760
asked about how to connect to the vpn

1402
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,640
and uh yeah let me just do an

1403
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,000
instruction on that

1404
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,920
uh yeah yeah absolutely um

1405
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,319
do either one of you who have windows or

1406
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:39,040
mac i have a windows machine but i'm

1407
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,960
using a deep i'm using a a

1408
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,319
a vm okay so you just connected the same

1409
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:44,880
as i did

1410
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,520
you got a mac um do you want to do a

1411
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,319
walkthrough

1412
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:51,440
marcel for how to open vpn on a mac

1413
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,640
well i could except for i haven't

1414
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,559
actually set it up for troy acme

1415
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:57,520
for the system so hopefully it would be

1416
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,480
like

1417
00:58:58,480 --> 00:58:59,270
real quick

1418
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:01,520
[Applause]

1419
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,119
i also want to address some other

1420
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:05,280
questions that came through

1421
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,760
where they were asking about if you need

1422
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:08,319
to have

1423
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:11,520
a vm in order to do the challenges you

1424
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:16,000
don't need a vm however it is suggested

1425
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,559
because it will make life a lot easier a

1426
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:19,680
lot of the tools

1427
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,960
and when i talked about building your um

1428
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,559
your box your in your your

1429
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:30,160
your practice box you have your tools in

1430
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,160
your cali machine that makes it a lot

1431
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,000
easier for you to just

1432
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,960
be able to build now myself if you're

1433
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,640
trying to look at the screen in here

1434
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,680
it will look small i know oh okay

1435
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:47,118
just check it out in stage

1436
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,319
but um for those out there who are

1437
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:51,839
questioning whether or not they need a

1438
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:52,799
vm

1439
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:55,920
if you if you don't have a vm you can

1440
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,280
hop on down to a virtualbox download

1441
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:02,880
and um and then go to a cali

1442
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:07,200
and download the the the pre-configured

1443
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,319
ova file for your virtual box

1444
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:12,400
if you don't have that option right now

1445
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,160
you can then try to connect

1446
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:17,440
into vpn to your actual machine but

1447
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,640
you're going to run into a lot of

1448
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,960
problems because a lot of the

1449
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,119
a lot of the challenges don't always

1450
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,720
have a online

1451
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,440
tool available for you to use so i hope

1452
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,119
that answers some of your question

1453
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:30,640
i'm going to give it to tabby and she's

1454
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,839
going to show us how to connect to vpn

1455
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:37,040
using a virtualbox you're not using a

1456
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,040
subscription one right you're using like

1457
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:42,319
i mean i'm like i i just have linux on

1458
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:44,160
my laptop and i just did

1459
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:47,119
install openvpn and ran openvpn and the

1460
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:47,839
file

1461
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:51,040
so yeah if like

1462
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,880
i wanna i wanna comment a little bit

1463
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,720
more about what you were saying about

1464
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,480
tools and like whether you need to have

1465
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,319
a vm whether you need to have linux

1466
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:00,000
whether you need to have

1467
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,440
um yeah like ultimately you know all of

1468
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:03,839
this

1469
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:07,359
is just using using computer tools

1470
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:12,000
in unexpected ways or in

1471
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,720
you know in creative ways and so like

1472
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:15,760
the right tool

1473
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,200
is whatever works for you so

1474
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,160
like if you're a windows expert and you

1475
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,280
know all about

1476
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,520
you know how to you know write scripts

1477
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,559
in windows

1478
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:28,079
you know a lot of the things where you

1479
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:30,160
need to do some data massaging

1480
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:33,200
that uh people would use cyber chef for

1481
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,760
online um i don't know if we ever showed

1482
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,839
cyber chef was pretty sweet

1483
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,200
like that there is a there's a problem

1484
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,480
for it but we didn't do one

1485
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,960
yeah okay so like you know a lot of the

1486
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,400
kinds of problems that people would use

1487
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,680
cyber chef for

1488
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:52,079
um i've been doing unix since i was a

1489
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:53,359
teenager so i use

1490
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:56,000
cat and sort and awk and those kind of

1491
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,160
kind of unix linux tools to do it

1492
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,160
if you or windows person like you can

1493
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,240
write scripts in powershell to do a lot

1494
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:03,440
of this kind of stuff

1495
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,839
whatever you know whatever works for you

1496
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:07,039
um

1497
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:09,280
so that means you know in a lot of cases

1498
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,079
you don't need

1499
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:13,119
special hacker tools you just need like

1500
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:15,680
general kind of how to do computation

1501
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,359
sort of tools and whatever you're

1502
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:18,319
comfortable with

1503
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:21,200
is good occasionally you do get to the

1504
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:21,680
point

1505
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:24,480
where you need to use some kinds of

1506
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,440
security

1507
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,319
specific tools and in a lot of those

1508
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:29,920
cases a lot of those tools

1509
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:34,480
are written for unix or linux focused

1510
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,720
audience so like i'm pretty sure you can

1511
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,880
download and run their buster on windows

1512
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,559
but i've never tried it because it's

1513
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:42,559
just right there in the ubuntu repo and

1514
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:45,760
and i'm a linux user so on one hand

1515
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,280
your life's gonna be a little easier

1516
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,039
because you'll be if you're using

1517
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:50,880
if you're using linux like then you're

1518
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,079
gonna be doing the thing that most

1519
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:52,960
people are doing

1520
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,200
but you don't have to like whatever

1521
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,000
whatever is comfortable for you is good

1522
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,079
yeah um so tyrone said he's ready so do

1523
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:03,680
we want to do the walkthrough

1524
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:06,720
we'll do the oh yeah and after tyrone

1525
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,799
and then we'll go from there all right

1526
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:11,520
so yeah i'm gonna leave and then you can

1527
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,160
let's

1528
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,559
wait she left why should he myself you

1529
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:15,200
don't let that

1530
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,640
in tyrone oh there he goes perfect

1531
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,720
all right we're gonna leave and leave

1532
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,520
you at it

1533
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:25,280
okay everyone should be able to hear me

1534
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,200
right

1535
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:30,240
all right so what i'm gonna do is i

1536
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:34,000
am actually going to

1537
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:38,079
share my screen i

1538
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:41,280
uh should be able to hear me

1539
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,559
i made the mistake of

1540
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:47,680
kicking myself out of the room believe

1541
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:50,160
it or not

1542
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:53,039
so i'm anxious to see how this is gonna

1543
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:54,400
look but

1544
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,280
um everyone

1545
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,440
all right so everyone should be able to

1546
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,520
see my

1547
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,640
second screen

1548
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:08,400
so this is the kali linux machine on one

1549
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,760
side i am going to

1550
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:27,839
not is that

1551
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,039
you know what feels weird is that i

1552
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:32,720
can't hear anything so i don't know if

1553
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:41,839
anyone can hear me

1554
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,079
all right

1555
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:07,200
another tip and trick that you can do

1556
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,400
for your

1557
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,119
calorie linux machine is to set up with

1558
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:11,440
an

1559
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,480
alias that will get your vpn up and

1560
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:15,839
running

1561
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:17,680
um so i'm just gonna assimilate right

1562
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:21,359
now because i kicked myself

1563
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:23,440
i kicked my user out of the room

1564
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:24,960
accidentally

1565
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,319
so i'm just gonna uh

1566
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:31,920
go to the room and

1567
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:35,119
maybe i'll just simulate it instead

1568
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:37,839
but

1569
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,559
i'm gonna do the very last one the pin

1570
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:43,119
testing one

1571
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:46,480
i have an alias that will automatically

1572
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:47,039
connect

1573
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:51,039
to my try hackme vpn

1574
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:54,400
called vpn2 and it's basically

1575
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,839
just connecting me and once i'm

1576
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:01,119
connected um then

1577
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:04,400
what you can do is just run through the

1578
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:08,640
enumeration process and then from there

1579
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:12,160
you would want to connect to the

1580
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:15,359
uh ip address that

1581
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:17,280
is not going to show up for me right now

1582
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,480
because i kicked myself

1583
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:21,359
out and then you would start your

1584
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:22,640
process

1585
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:25,039
um i might have missed a little bit of

1586
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:25,680
the earlier

1587
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,000
portions but for anyone that doesn't

1588
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
have a calorie linux vm

1589
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,760
tryhackme does offer the

1590
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:37,599
um a web-based kali linux machine

1591
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:41,039
in case you want to connect that way

1592
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:47,839
so the very first question in the

1593
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:52,000
variable in the pinterest task

1594
01:06:52,000 --> 01:07:01,839
i'm just waiting for it to load it now

1595
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,680
and there's a there's a reason why i put

1596
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,200
this in just a prep

1597
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,640
one together so anyone that does well

1598
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:14,240
here in task 26 then

1599
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:17,760
you should highly consider going after

1600
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,799
some of the uh hands-on

1601
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:23,920
practical certs like the ejpt and the

1602
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,079
ceh practical

1603
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,240
so the very first question would be what

1604
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:29,599
is the

1605
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:32,880
um ip

1606
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,520
what is the

1607
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:43,839
so i believe that one is what is the uh

1608
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:56,880
you can do that oh oh wow

1609
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,240
all right so the very first question is

1610
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,000
what is the host name so

1611
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,520
just a simple in-app scan

1612
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:06,559
uh we'll get you

1613
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:08,079
something similar i can't believe i just

1614
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:11,039
did that and not notice

1615
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:15,359
uh pn means all ports

1616
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:18,319
you want to target the machine and maybe

1617
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:19,279
do a dash dash

1618
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:22,799
open so something like that will

1619
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:26,080
be a verbose fast

1620
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:29,520
in-map scan with the service version

1621
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:33,198
and the scripts option enabled

1622
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:37,040
the dash pn means don't ping

1623
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:40,238
um dash p dash means all ports

1624
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:44,640
ip address um of your target

1625
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:47,040
and the dash dash open simply means only

1626
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,640
show me the ports

1627
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:52,719
that are open that is a really good

1628
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:56,158
initial map scan to get you started

1629
01:08:56,158 --> 01:08:58,238
you will start to get information based

1630
01:08:58,238 --> 01:08:59,520
off of that

1631
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:03,679
the way that i created the tasks was

1632
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:05,839
um as you start to answer these

1633
01:09:05,839 --> 01:09:08,000
questions

1634
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,439
the the question will lead you to

1635
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:14,399
an answer for the next question and then

1636
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:15,279
by the end

1637
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:18,158
we should all get that secret stop text

1638
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:18,799
um which

1639
01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:22,560
would be the ultimate goal on the

1640
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:26,080
administrator's account

1641
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:30,080
cool yeah so

1642
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:31,839
i see someone who's looking to get into

1643
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:34,158
the oscp

1644
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:36,880
once you do this pinches to prep then

1645
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,238
you should think about how that makes

1646
01:09:38,238 --> 01:09:39,279
you feel

1647
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:42,560
uh this machine would be considered

1648
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:46,238
an easy machine in the oscp lab

1649
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:49,839
so just keep that in mind

1650
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,399
that concludes i can always come back at

1651
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:53,920
any time to do

1652
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,239
uh another demo i'm going to need some

1653
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:58,560
time to set up another account

1654
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:03,120
and get that going all right

1655
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:17,840
so good luck everyone

1656
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:24,560
and qmu so so if we got something we can

1657
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,480
do before then while i'm installing

1658
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:29,679
windows that would be probably to best

1659
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:33,199
interest i wasn't sure what was going on

1660
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:36,719
all right um i can't i don't know

1661
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:39,199
myself can you give me and read out some

1662
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:41,040
questions we're getting from

1663
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,960
because i'm like trying to go back and

1664
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,560
forth and yes

1665
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:48,080
yes so well a couple of things um we had

1666
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,600
a couple of questions that have been

1667
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,600
fixed that people were asking about so

1668
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:52,880
if you were trying something that you

1669
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,480
thought was right and it didn't work

1670
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:58,159
try it again please um and then with

1671
01:10:58,159 --> 01:10:59,520
regard to walkthroughs

1672
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:02,320
um everybody should be like in the troy

1673
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,159
hackney platform now so maybe

1674
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:06,239
they have some suggestions of something

1675
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:07,840
they would like to see

1676
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,040

broadcasting

1680
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:23,199
yeah i don't know who said that um

1681
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:26,239
anyway okay so yeah so if there's any

1682
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:27,840
requests for walkthroughs we could do

1683
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:28,320
that

1684
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,320
we could also wrap this up it doesn't

1685
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,000
have to run for two hours and just let

1686
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:32,800
everybody

1687
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,920
have at it um we need there's that

1688
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,000
option too i just wanted to do at least

1689
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,040
the walkthrough of

1690
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,520
setting up the vpn since people yeah

1691
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,120
having problems with that

1692
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:46,080
um i can show what i do with mine which

1693
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:49,360
is just basically from a linux machine

1694
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:51,679
um

1695
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,400
yeah and as we pointed out before i mean

1696
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,159
there's there's pretty good instructions

1697
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,000
on the try hat made platform on how to

1698
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:58,800
do this

1699
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:02,719
so i i hacker is read the directions

1700
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:04,719
yeah exactly so i'm a little bit

1701
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:06,480
reluctant to like go over stuff about

1702
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:07,520
the platform

1703
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,840
you know we're here to support with the

1704
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,679
the challenges themselves

1705
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:14,880
um and i just want to do a shout out to

1706
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,880
the team again if you missed my intro

1707
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,760

1708
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:20,239
team

1709
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:22,640
um all volunteers building these

1710
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,480
challenges for you all to use

1711
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:27,679
and uh we've been working on it for

1712
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:32,000
gosh how long months jay right like

1713
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,000
it's been a long time so yeah

1714
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,760
be patient with us please we're all just

1715
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,199
here volunteering to

1716
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:41,679
to help you get some uh some ctf

1717
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:43,840
exposure and have some fun and maybe win

1718
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:44,960
some prizes

1719
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:48,159
um but yeah i'm open to requests on

1720
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:49,360
walkthroughs so we'll

1721
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,440
we'll play that by year depending on

1722
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:52,640
what we get

1723
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:56,159
um and i think

1724
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:58,400
yeah i see that open vpn would be good

1725
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,159
is when what somebody said

1726
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:02,400
yeah all right well tabby said she was

1727
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,480
setting that up right so she's doing the

1728
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,920
one from windows

1729
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:10,880
um i can do the the like the linux

1730
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:13,199
um

1731
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,080
i am i'm a little reluctant to do any

1732
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:17,840
walkthroughs right now just because i'm

1733
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:18,640
dealing with like

1734
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:21,600
the chats and the different rooms so um

1735
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:22,640
but

1736
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:25,440
i can do i can do this one i can do that

1737
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:26,480
yes

1738
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:30,159
okay and then um yeah

1739
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:33,120
so uh so you know we we could share our

1740
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:33,520
jay

1741
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,159
like our history going back doing cyber

1742
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:37,360
competitions

1743
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,440
how many cyber competitions have we done

1744
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:41,600
together now

1745
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:45,040
a lot yeah

1746
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:47,600
i mean then it's like a lot of them have

1747
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:48,640
been remote

1748
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:51,600
just because of the distance like where

1749
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:52,080
we live

1750
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:54,159
in the sense it's really nice that it's

1751
01:13:54,159 --> 01:13:55,280
available

1752
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:58,960
remotely we're able to do the challenges

1753
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:02,000
um yeah yeah like we we did

1754
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,400
it um let's see i know the first one i

1755
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,239
did with tabby was the open vp

1756
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:09,440
i decided to open ctf at that time right

1757
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,280
yes she told me that was the first one

1758
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,440
she had ever done i was like yeah right

1759
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:17,199
you're like killing everybody here

1760
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:21,360
so i'm like my first one i didn't even

1761
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:23,199
know what a linux box was

1762
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:26,000
and it wasn't that bad but i was pretty

1763
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,280
close

1764
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,040
i knew what a linux was but i didn't

1765
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,520
know i didn't know about openvpn so when

1766
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,640
people are talking about

1767
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:34,480
you know like what are you setting up

1768
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:37,040
with it it resonates with me because

1769
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,040
yes i was there and it wasn't that long

1770
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,040
ago like you said jay

1771
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:44,480
google is your friend

1772
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,920
no so i i was just thinking back to like

1773
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,840
my very first cyber competition

1774
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:52,640
and it was a digital forensics

1775
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:53,760
competition

1776
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:56,880
the dc3 one that's no longer there sadly

1777
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,679
it was such a good one

1778
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,719
but there was one question where you had

1779
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:04,880
to analyze the packet capture

1780
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,199
to figure out like what happened there

1781
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:09,280
was an intrusion of some sort right

1782
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:12,800
and and i was assigned that

1783
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:16,080
question from my little team and i was

1784
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:16,480
like

1785
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:20,799
okay what's a p cap

1786
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:24,800
and now he's called the pcap expert

1787
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,760
yeah so i mean but it's kind of funny

1788
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:32,320
because

1789
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,679
you know when you do these cyber

1790
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:35,760
competitions like you don't even know

1791
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:36,880
like the long-term

1792
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:38,400
sort of effects that it's going to have

1793
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:39,920
but but yeah like you said

1794
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,560
like here i have no clue what a pcap is

1795
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:43,120
and now

1796
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,040
i'm like all about network traffic

1797
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,360
analysis and would i have been exposed

1798
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,199
at some point in time yeah probably

1799
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:52,080
but but that got my passion kind of

1800
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,280
started early

1801
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:57,120
um so you already talked about this

1802
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,120
in your your presentation but i think

1803
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,920
ctfs are are so valuable for so many

1804
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:04,480
different reasons um also i should

1805
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:04,960
mention

1806
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:08,480
we have a uh women's society of cyber

1807
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,400
jitsu ctf slack

1808
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:13,760
um i can share the link for that

1809
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:16,800
um we've got about 350 people in there

1810
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,679
we do competitions together we build

1811
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:22,400
competitions together like this event

1812
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,239
and and we pretty much always got

1813
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:26,480
something going so like right now

1814
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:29,040
um there's a group of us that are doing

1815
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,960
the cyber reasons ctf

1816
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,480
not that i have done any of it yet

1817
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:34,000
because i've been busy with this

1818
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,560
and work and stuff but um but there's

1819
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:37,040
lots of

1820
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:39,040
opportunities out there to get involved

1821
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:41,280
so i will i'll get an invitation link

1822
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:42,480
and share that

1823
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:46,000
out with folks okay

1824
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,640
let's see here we got some okay somebody

1825
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:49,600

tutorial which helped great they're

1827

1831
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:06,560
the walkthrough and it basically was

1832
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:07,600
where he give you

1833
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:11,120
the the the command line which i typed

1834
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,760
in the chat box for how to scan

1835
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:16,480
and then once you scan that it will get

1836
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:17,840
you to your answer i

1837
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,159
i think he didn't want to give you

1838
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:21,199
everything

1839
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:24,080
um it's a little stingy with his hints

1840
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:24,570
for sure

1841
01:17:24,570 --> 01:17:28,080
[Laughter]

1842
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:29,920
and you've got somebody asking for the

1843
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,199
link to the the

1844
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:33,600
um the slack so yeah i'm gonna pull that

1845
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:34,640
up in just a sec

1846
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,120
i've gotta go i've gotta go create it

1847
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:38,320
basically make an open

1848
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,920
invite for people to join um

1849
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:45,120
um i see questions about hashes um i can

1850
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:48,400
tell you that if you if you are using

1851
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:52,640
um if you are using um say kali for

1852
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:53,679
example

1853
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:56,880
you have hash id which is a a

1854
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,040
a built-in identifi identifier but you

1855
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:00,239
can also go online

1856
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:03,840
if you google hey remember google

1857
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:07,520
if you google um identifiers

1858
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:09,120
there are a lot of them out there and

1859
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,120
what it will do is is give you

1860
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,920
uh an approximate an approximation of

1861
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,840
what it thinks the hash is

1862
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:18,159
that you're looking for and that can

1863
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:20,480
help take you to your next step of what

1864
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:23,440
you want to look for

1865
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:27,679
okay um we're ready for a tavi

1866
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:31,040
to come on and show us how to do vpn

1867
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,480
from a windows machine

1868
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:35,199
all right so hey i'm sure you increase

1869
01:18:35,199 --> 01:18:36,480
the size really sorry

1870
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,239
i'm really sorry to be that girl but

1871
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:39,760
like i didn't actually have a windows

1872
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:41,440
machine thank you all for bearing with

1873
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:42,080
me

1874
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:45,360
while i installed windows 7.

1875
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:48,640
so y'all gonna get to see my horrible

1876
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,480
looking windows 7. i hope you're not

1877
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,239
using windows 7 anymore

1878
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:54,880
but that was the uh version of windows

1879
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,960
that i had an iso sitting around for

1880
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:00,320
and was able to install in a vm here

1881
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:03,040
so i'm here in my windows 7 vm there's

1882
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:05,040
no video drivers so everything's huge

1883
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,360
but we're just going to deal with that

1884
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,880
so here we are

1885
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:11,120
and the first thing we're going to want

1886
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:12,000
is to go

1887
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,040
over here to access machines

1888
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:18,640
and choose open vpn so we're here

1889
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:21,679
we're on us east regular one so i can

1890
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:24,640
download my configuration file um and

1891
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,159
it's going to give you this file that's

1892
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:29,360
your tryhackme username.openvpn

1893
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,760
and we're going to save it and i'm just

1894
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:33,360
going to save it i don't know actually

1895
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,360
where did you save it firefox

1896
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:38,480
uh let's click this little button

1897
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:41,600
and see it okay so it put it into my

1898
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:42,960
downloads folder

1899
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:44,480
so i'm going to copy it and i'm going to

1900
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,320
move it to the desktop just because

1901
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:47,360
that's going to make life a little

1902
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:51,839
easier for me

1903
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,159
all right i'm gonna paste this here

1904
01:19:58,159 --> 01:19:59,760
there's our openvpn file

1905
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:02,719
next thing that we're gonna need is a

1906
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:04,880
copy of the openvpn

1907
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:09,440
software for windows and

1908
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,719
you get that from google

1909
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:16,239
you can search for openvpn make sure

1910
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:17,040
that the

1911
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:20,400
link looks legit yeah yeah okay this is

1912
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:25,040
this is legit so we'll go to downloads

1913
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:31,520
we don't want the source code um

1914
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:34,480
i don't remember what uh whether this is

1915
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,800
a 32 or a 64-bit

1916
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:40,960
vm let's see 64-bit vm

1917
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:44,480
so we'll get the windows 64-bit

1918
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:50,080
msi installer gonna save it

1919
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:55,199
it's downloaded show me here

1920
01:20:55,199 --> 01:20:58,560
we're gonna run the installer yep i'm

1921
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,400
gonna install

1922
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:03,679
and so now we've got uh now we got the

1923
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:05,760
openvpn installer running here

1924
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:09,440
yep let's run this msi

1925
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:15,679
um you will need to be administrator

1926
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:17,840
because it needs to install a bunch of

1927
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,920
special network adapter drivers

1928
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:22,080
for the virtual network adapter that the

1929
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,159
vpn traffic will come in on

1930
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:26,080
so it looks like we actually have

1931
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,600
openvpn now

1932
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:33,600
and okay so the gui says

1933
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:38,800
okay well i

1934
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:42,239
will see whether this works yep it's

1935
01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:42,880
saying

1936
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:45,840
if you want your files to be easy to

1937
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:48,000
open you can copy them into one of these

1938
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,679
directories

1939
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:53,520
but also i see that my

1940
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,400
my config file also has this nice

1941
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:57,280
openvpn

1942
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,920
logo on it so if we just double click on

1943
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:02,080
it it opens in notepad anyway which was

1944
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:02,800
not

1945
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:06,320
the desired behavior but looks like the

1946
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,320
openvpn gui has registered

1947
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,960
a right click handler so i can say start

1948
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:13,679
openvpn on this config file

1949
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:17,920
and now what do we got here

1950
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:21,040
failed to initialize tap windows so i

1951
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:21,760
wonder

1952
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:26,080
if i need to reboot or if the problem is

1953
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:29,679
the driver signing actually being for

1954
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:30,719
realsies

1955
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:33,600
so let's

1956
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:38,159
let's reboot our vm and

1957
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:53,839
hope it works after we reboot our vm

1958
01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:05,520
it's been a while since i've seen this

1959
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:07,840
screen

1960
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:32,840
are you okay windows i hope windows is

1961
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:35,840
okay

1962
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:41,120
i appreciate everybody's patience as i

1963
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:42,719
hope that windows appreciates my

1964
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:45,199
patience

1965
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:51,280
oh that was that was interesting as well

1966
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:03,120
okay

1967
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,280
yes i would certainly like to install

1968
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:08,559
this driver thank you

1969
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:17,600
and that one yeah i'll certainly trust

1970
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,120
that

1971
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,719
i mean i asked you to install it didn't

1972
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:22,800
i

1973
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:28,719
okay so those

1974
01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:30,560
uh those do you want to install this

1975
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:34,480
driver prompt seem pretty promising

1976
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:39,760
still no love with

1977
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:43,280
the uh tap windows device

1978
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:47,519
all right so

1979
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:59,840
can we

1980
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:04,849
[Applause]

1981
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:14,719
um let's see

1982
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:17,840
if there is a different one

1983
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:27,679
that we should be using

1984
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:32,639
let's let's try and go back to

1985
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:40,639
to a previous one

1986
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:55,840
let's let's try this older one

1987
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:02,080
okay goodbye old openvpn

1988
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:05,600
or rather goodbye new openvpn

1989
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,040
yeah close that because i don't need

1990
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:10,400
that anyway since it doesn't work

1991
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:19,280
and now we will

1992
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:22,800
try this older

1993
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:28,400
not beta openvpn

1994
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:31,120
everybody cross your fingers we're all

1995
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:34,159
in this together

1996
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:37,199
yes i definitely want all of those

1997
01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:40,000
default choices

1998
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,760
and now we're installing openvpn yes

1999
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:48,239
please install tap for windows

2000
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:50,719
it's the network tap driver which i

2001
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:51,520
believe

2002
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:55,120
is uh a concept ported over

2003
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:58,639
from windows i mean excuse me port a

2004
01:26:58,639 --> 01:26:59,120
concept

2005
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:01,920
ported over from linux because uh the

2006
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:04,000
openvpn software was itself

2007
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,440
originally written on linux and so

2008
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,440
you need the special windows drivers to

2009
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:11,440
be able to run it

2010
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:15,679
but right now we're installing.net 4.0

2011
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:17,360
yes of course i've read the license

2012
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:19,839
terms

2013
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:27,520
i assume that this portion of the whole

2014
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:29,679
procedure where you try to get openvpn

2015
01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:30,400
working

2016
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:33,920
is easier if you're not on windows 7 so

2017
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:36,000
my apologies for that being the version

2018
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,480
of windows that i had sitting around

2019
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:47,839
but i think we'll get there

2020
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,560
let's check our

2021
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:02,480
chat box here

2022
01:28:04,239 --> 01:28:06,159
yeah you can definitely quote are you

2023
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:08,880
okay windows

2024
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:12,000
um you know there was a time

2025
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
there was a time when uh when i really

2026
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,679
hated windows because

2027
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:19,040
i used macs and i just knew

2028
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:22,639
that that macs were greatly superior and

2029
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:25,280
the longer that i have worked in tech

2030
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:27,040
the longer that i've worked on computer

2031
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:28,000
security

2032
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
the less i believe that anything is

2033
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,520
actually the best

2034
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:34,320
but that everything is good at some

2035
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:35,679
things and bad at others

2036
01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:38,639
and it's important to choose the right

2037
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:40,840
tool for the job

2038
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:43,840
so you know i i do ask

2039
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:46,159
are you okay windows but i asked linux

2040
01:28:46,159 --> 01:28:49,040
the same thing are you okay linux

2041
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:51,199
are you are you okay open bst are you

2042
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:57,839
feeling sick this morning

2043
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:11,360
boot my camera button real quick

2044
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:12,960
i did not expect that i was going to be

2045
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:15,920
live installing.net framework 4

2046
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:19,199
today but uh i appreciate uh appreciate

2047
01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:20,159
everybody's

2048
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:22,800
patience with this yeah that's a really

2049
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,159
good question um

2050
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:28,080
whether openvpn is working on wsl2

2051
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:31,360
um i assume that it can't work on

2052
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:34,800
legacy wsl because it has to do so much

2053
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,880
fancy low-level network stuff

2054
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:40,480
that just doesn't exist in the world

2055
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:44,960
of original wsl but yeah wsl2

2056
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,440
where you're really running an implied

2057
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:48,320
hypervisor

2058
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:51,840
and a real linux kernel in it seems

2059
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:53,760
architecturally as if it could work

2060
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:56,080
so that could also be an interesting

2061
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,360
option for people who are

2062
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:00,159
on the newest build of windows 10 and

2063
01:30:00,159 --> 01:30:07,839
have access to wsl2

2064
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,639
i suppose we can interpret this

2065
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:17,040
experience as an advertisement for the

2066
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:18,840
uh try hack me

2067
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:22,000
membership because

2068
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,159
you you spend your ten dollars a month

2069
01:30:24,159 --> 01:30:26,400
and then you click give me a uh

2070
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,159
give me a kali vm in the browser and

2071
01:30:28,159 --> 01:30:29,679
then you have it um

2072
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:31,360
which should also be handy if you were

2073
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:33,360
trying to play like from a tablet or

2074
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:34,400
something

2075
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:38,000
but uh i'm i'm i'm committed at this

2076
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,840
point we are going to connect to openvpn

2077
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:42,719
from windows one way or another

2078
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:45,040
all right yeah we got net i always

2079
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:47,679
wanted.net

2080
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:51,040
yeah cool general quick start for

2081
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:52,239
windows

2082
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:54,800
requires a config file we got a config

2083
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:56,719
file you can run it as a service but

2084
01:30:56,719 --> 01:30:57,920
that sounds fancy

2085
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,679
here's how to build it i don't want to

2086
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:01,600
build it i just want to try using it

2087
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:05,040
so now we'll go back

2088
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:08,080
we'll get uh we'll get a new clean

2089
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:10,480
firefox window

2090
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:16,639
and start openvpn on this config file

2091
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:20,480
hey what do we got here windows tunnel

2092
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,960
adapter succeeded initialization

2093
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:24,560
sequence completed

2094
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:27,600
so i believe that we are now actually on

2095
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:30,800
openvpn let's see if we can deploy a

2096
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:33,199
machine

2097
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:45,840
oh firefox you helpfully uh

2098
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,159
you helpfully saved my username i don't

2099
01:31:52,159 --> 01:31:54,239
actually like that

2100
01:31:54,239 --> 01:31:59,839
cool so we're here and try hack me

2101
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:05,440
remember the room name all right i'll

2102
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:06,880
use my real hacker voice

2103
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:10,960
i'm in so now let's go to one of these

2104
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:12,560
oh i actually have the pickle rick

2105
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:13,679
machine still open

2106
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:17,199
so with openvpn running let's see if we

2107
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:27,839
can access pickle rick

2108
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:39,760
so i wasn't 100 sure that i trusted uh

2109
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:42,000
my openvpn connection or the pickleric

2110
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,080
vm so i tried going to it in the browser

2111
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:45,199
but it's just spinning

2112
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:47,280
so i've opened up a cmd window here and

2113
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:49,199
i've typed ping and then the ip address

2114
01:32:49,199 --> 01:32:51,760
that's also not doing anything good

2115
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:55,040
so either my vm is no good

2116
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:58,880
or openvpn was just kidding when it's

2117
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:02,960
oh windows windows route add command

2118
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:09,840
failed returned error code one

2119
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:13,440
and why is that i'm gonna try running

2120
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:15,040
the open vpn gui

2121
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:23,840
as admin instead

2122
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:31,120
use import menu or copy your okay so

2123
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:34,320
let's actually try that

2124
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:40,480
open vpn gui import file

2125
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:45,040
downloads here's my file please import

2126
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:50,400
file imported successfully

2127
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:52,960
connect

2128
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:59,360
does this look better uh

2129
01:33:59,679 --> 01:34:02,719
now connected okay i've been fooled

2130
01:34:02,719 --> 01:34:04,480
before but

2131
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:07,920
all right we're here so

2132
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:10,400
let's uh let's go back to the beginning

2133
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:10,960
and

2134
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:14,320
pretend that this all worked from the

2135
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:14,960
beginning

2136
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:18,320
and go over what the procedure is

2137
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:21,360
so first

2138
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:25,400
we went and went to

2139
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:28,080
openvpn.net

2140
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:31,440
and downloaded a stable version of

2141
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:34,239
openvpn

2142
01:34:35,679 --> 01:34:38,719
so we're going to say

2143
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:45,600
so we're going to we're gonna go in here

2144
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:47,199
sorry about that distraction

2145
01:34:47,199 --> 01:34:49,119
we're gonna go here and we're gonna say

2146
01:34:49,119 --> 01:34:50,440
community

2147
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:53,440
downloads

2148
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:57,360
and i tried

2149
01:34:57,360 --> 01:35:00,400
and did not appreciate the beta 1 so if

2150
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:01,520
we instead

2151
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:04,560
go to the maintenance release

2152
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:07,840
249 select your appropriate version of

2153
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:08,880
windows

2154
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:11,840
download it run the installer through to

2155
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:12,880
completion

2156
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:15,280
and you'll eventually get to the point

2157
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:16,960
where you can go to your start menu

2158
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:21,040
and choose open vpn gui

2159
01:35:21,119 --> 01:35:24,080
open openvpn gui will show up over in

2160
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:26,800
your taskbar

2161
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:30,000
and then you can go to the try hack me

2162
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,199
web page

2163
01:35:31,199 --> 01:35:35,040
on the left side under access machines

2164
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:38,320
click open vpn select

2165
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:40,560
the vpn server that's close to you i'm

2166
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:42,000
going to say used regular

2167
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,480
one you say download my configuration

2168
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:46,320
file

2169
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:50,480
save it wherever it's saved like in this

2170
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:52,800
case in your downloads folder

2171
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:55,840
go back to your taskbar open gui

2172
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:59,920
right click that thing say import file

2173
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:03,040
pick that new file you downloaded file

2174
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:07,280
imported successfully and

2175
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:08,960
now i have two so i get to choose which

2176
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,480
one to connect with

2177
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:12,960
go to it in the taskbar right click find

2178
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:13,840
your thing

2179
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:17,040
say connect little window pops up

2180
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:18,880
shows you a ton of information about the

2181
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:20,320
state of what's going on with your

2182
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:21,920
networking

2183
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:24,400
and if you connect well eventually it

2184
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:25,360
tells you

2185
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:28,080
tabi is now connected once we're

2186
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:29,760
connected

2187
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:34,400
get back into the try hack me room

2188
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:39,119
deploy a vm

2189
01:36:39,119 --> 01:36:41,040
in this case i've got the pickleric vm

2190
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:42,639
deployed

2191
01:36:42,639 --> 01:36:46,480
copy that ip address and start

2192
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:48,480
doing your things with it in this case

2193
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:50,880
because i know it's a web server

2194
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:53,040
just paste it in the address bar here

2195
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:55,600
and now here i've connected to openvpn

2196
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:58,880
on windows and deployed a vm and

2197
01:36:58,880 --> 01:36:59,920
connected to

2198
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:04,480
our pickleric vm via windows

2199
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:07,679
i can go to login.php and if i had the

2200
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:09,280
password

2201
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:11,440
then i'd be able to get to the command

2202
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:13,360
shell and it would be

2203
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:14,880
exactly the walkthrough that we had

2204
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:16,639
before except

2205
01:37:16,639 --> 01:37:20,239
on windows so i hope that that's helpful

2206
01:37:20,239 --> 01:37:21,280
for people

2207
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:25,440
um there's also

2208
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:30,560
the try hackme platform help

2209
01:37:31,119 --> 01:37:32,840
which you can get to by clicking this

2210
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:34,560
button

2211
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:49,840
how to connect to openvpn

2212
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:55,760
and if you click around you can get to

2213
01:37:55,760 --> 01:38:00,000
this page which i will

2214
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:04,159
manually type into the chat because i

2215
01:38:04,159 --> 01:38:05,840
can't actually copy and paste out of

2216
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:16,080
this vm

2217
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:19,119
click it to make sure i got it right oh

2218
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:20,800
you gotta be logged in first

2219
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:24,800
but uh there you go that's

2220
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:27,119
that's how you do it live i hope that

2221
01:38:27,119 --> 01:38:29,040
you don't have the uh struggles that i

2222
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:30,000
did with the

2223
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:33,280
openvpn version but uh if you're not

2224
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:34,480
running windows 7

2225
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:37,199
and if you choose the release version

2226
01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:38,400
and not the beta version

2227
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:41,840
i expect that you'll have good luck

2228
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:43,840
while i'm still here on video we'll take

2229
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,600
a few seconds if anybody wants to ask

2230
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:46,239
any

2231
01:38:46,239 --> 01:38:49,600
specific questions and otherwise i will

2232
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:50,000
drop

2233
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,719
off and we will all wish you well in the

2234
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:53,679
ctf

2235
01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:57,280
join us over in the ctf session and

2236
01:38:57,280 --> 01:39:01,199
we'll be there to text chat with you

2237
01:39:11,199 --> 01:39:14,239
all right yeah thanks a lot but

2238
01:39:14,239 --> 01:39:16,080
i did do a linux command quite some

2239
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:17,520
quite some time ago when i was on linux

2240
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:20,320
yeah what's the question

2241
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:28,400
hmm okay you know we i

2242
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:30,560
i remember enough of this uh we can

2243
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:32,400
actually just go right back through this

2244
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:36,000
and i will be happy to describe

2245
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,639
that so

2246
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,280
gotta type the file name correctly or

2247
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:43,040
four or fours at you

2248
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:47,119
um so

2249
01:39:48,159 --> 01:39:50,140
ah that's not right there

2250
01:39:50,140 --> 01:39:52,480
[Applause]

2251
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:54,320
we get our username back which was on

2252
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:56,639
the source of this webpage

2253
01:39:56,639 --> 01:40:00,880
rick rule is so we'll paste that in here

2254
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:03,760
and the password was in the robots.txt

2255
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:05,520
we'll paste that in here we get the

2256
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:07,199
login page

2257
01:40:07,199 --> 01:40:08,560
yeah please don't save you're not

2258
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:11,440
helpful okay so

2259
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:13,360
so yeah yeah it is something with uh

2260
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:15,119
with that symbol so this is a

2261
01:40:15,119 --> 01:40:18,159
this is a a very very old school

2262
01:40:18,159 --> 01:40:22,080
unix ism where unix tools are

2263
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:26,480
generally designed to accept data

2264
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:28,639
from their standard input and then

2265
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:29,920
output data to their

2266
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:33,040
standard output and so if we just use

2267
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:33,920
this like it's a

2268
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:35,280
like it's a linux prompt because it

2269
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:38,159
basically is

2270
01:40:38,159 --> 01:40:40,639
so we can run the echo command hi tdi

2271
01:40:40,639 --> 01:40:41,600
and it'll say hi

2272
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:44,960
tdi but

2273
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:48,239
now we can

2274
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:51,280
we can run that same command but pipe it

2275
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:51,600
to

2276
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:54,000
say the program cat oh and it's gonna

2277
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,679
smack us because you're not allowed to

2278
01:40:55,679 --> 01:40:56,800
run

2279
01:40:56,800 --> 01:41:00,560
cat so we'll instead pipe it to

2280
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:04,639
dd because that will also work um

2281
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:06,800
the this vertical bar character is the

2282
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:08,320
same thing as on the backslash key of

2283
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:08,960
your keyboard

2284
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:11,280
and it connects the standard output of

2285
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:12,159
echo

2286
01:41:12,159 --> 01:41:14,560
to the standard input of the next

2287
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:15,440
command

2288
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:17,520
um actually i'll do a little bit of

2289
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:20,719
magic here

2290
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:29,440
so that we can see that it does

2291
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:32,400
something

2292
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:34,159
i remember the syntax for this it'll

2293
01:41:34,159 --> 01:41:36,880
uppercase everything for us

2294
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:38,960
i'm going to copy it in case i didn't

2295
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:47,840
remember the syntax for it that's

2296
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:57,600
okay so the pipe character takes the

2297
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:59,040
output uh

2298
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:00,880
yeah so the the pipe character takes the

2299
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:02,320
output of one command and runs it into

2300
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:03,360
the next command

2301
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:07,759
so like the example that i just did was

2302
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:15,280
um and this is this is kind of fancy

2303
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:16,480
unix stuff

2304
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:19,199
um it's not super fancy but it's like

2305
01:42:19,199 --> 01:42:20,480
you know this would be this would be

2306
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:22,639
unix 201 not unix 101.

2307
01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:25,280
um so the said command can do editing on

2308
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:26,000
text

2309
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,400
and so i've this said command here takes

2310
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:30,080
every instance of high and replaces it

2311
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:31,119
with bi

2312
01:42:31,119 --> 01:42:36,000
um but now other things that we can do

2313
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:40,320
are like for uh like for example

2314
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:43,520
we can do ls we can see the files here

2315
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:46,800
and remember we can't just cat the file

2316
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:49,520
which is the sort of normal unix way of

2317
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:50,880
viewing a file

2318
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:54,000
because the challenge doesn't let us but

2319
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,840
there's a ton of other ways to read a

2320
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:57,360
file in unix

2321
01:42:57,360 --> 01:43:00,560
so for example the

2322
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:02,719
read built-in command of the shell will

2323
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:04,159
take some input and

2324
01:43:04,159 --> 01:43:07,199
save it into a file now excuse me a file

2325
01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:08,880
save it into a variable

2326
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:12,400
so you do like read my

2327
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:16,080
variable and now this is the

2328
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:19,679
other part of the pipe command

2329
01:43:19,679 --> 01:43:21,840
so you can put a pipe the vertical bar

2330
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:23,520
in between two unix commands and it

2331
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:25,520
takes the one and puts it into the other

2332
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:29,360
but you can also do the

2333
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:32,400
less than symbol here which looks like

2334
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:34,320
an arrow pointing to the left

2335
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:38,080
in order to read from a file instead

2336
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:42,559
so when i do this

2337
01:43:43,119 --> 01:43:45,679
this command here which i'll type in

2338
01:43:45,679 --> 01:43:52,639
over here

2339
01:43:52,639 --> 01:43:55,760
um is going to take the first line of

2340
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:56,400
whatever

2341
01:43:56,400 --> 01:44:00,080
file you put and put it into the

2342
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:02,159
variable myvar

2343
01:44:02,159 --> 01:44:03,840
because that's what the read program

2344
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:06,480
does um

2345
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:08,880
so then because it doesn't let us do cat

2346
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:10,239
but we know we want to know what's in

2347
01:44:10,239 --> 01:44:11,360
this file

2348
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:15,040
now if we execute this there would be

2349
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:17,440
temporarily a unix shell variable called

2350
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:19,280
myvar that contained the ingredient that

2351
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:20,800
we wanted but that isn't good enough we

2352
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:21,679
need to actually

2353
01:44:21,679 --> 01:44:25,360
see it but that's echo to the rescue

2354
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:28,320
so now that we have a variable we can

2355
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:30,159
say

2356
01:44:30,159 --> 01:44:35,839
something like this

2357
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:42,880
a command like this the semicolon

2358
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:44,480
separates two unix commands from each

2359
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:46,239
other so it says do the thing before the

2360
01:44:46,239 --> 01:44:47,920
semicolon then do the thing after the

2361
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:48,800
semicolon

2362
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:50,800
so the thing before the semicolon is

2363
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:52,320
read the first line

2364
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:56,639
of the file.txt into this program read

2365
01:44:56,639 --> 01:44:58,320
and the program read takes whatever it

2366
01:44:58,320 --> 01:44:59,760
reads and shoves it into the variable

2367
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:01,600
you specify

2368
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:03,760
after we've done that then run the echo

2369
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:05,600
program and what i want you to echo

2370
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:08,159
is whatever the contents of the variable

2371
01:45:08,159 --> 01:45:08,800
myvar

2372
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:12,719
is and so we do it

2373
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:16,639
and now we got the flag because

2374
01:45:16,639 --> 01:45:18,320
we could have just catted the flag but

2375
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:20,080
they didn't allow us to so

2376
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:22,080
instead we did something that was a

2377
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:24,960
little bit fancier

2378
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:28,480
yeah yeah christina i i totally i

2379
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:29,280
totally love it

2380
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:33,040
um big big shout out to overthewire.org

2381
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:36,320
and especially the overthewire.org room

2382
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:40,560
named i think natas

2383
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:43,840
let me fetch up a link for that bandit

2384
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:44,719
um

2385
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:48,560
folks who who want to start to learn

2386
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:51,760
or practice some munich skills in

2387
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:55,360
a fun game-ified kind of way

2388
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:58,719
yeah overthewire.org slash bandit um

2389
01:45:58,719 --> 01:46:02,320
at a previous job the um getting through

2390
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:03,760
bandit was actually

2391
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:06,719
one of the last parts of training for

2392
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:07,520
new people

2393
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:11,040
on the unix team because it's it's fun

2394
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:14,719
it's engaging and it's it it covers a

2395
01:46:14,719 --> 01:46:16,320
lot of neat stuff

2396
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:19,600
so yeah if you if you are new to

2397
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:22,880
unix and you want to learn you know your

2398
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:26,080
way around unix command line

2399
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:28,239
i mean honestly the super ancient book

2400
01:46:28,239 --> 01:46:29,199
from the 80s

2401
01:46:29,199 --> 01:46:32,159
called the unix programming environment

2402
01:46:32,159 --> 01:46:32,880
the

2403
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:36,080
the last few chapters of it are a super

2404
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:38,560
outdated view of how to write unix

2405
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:40,080
programs and so you don't really care

2406
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:40,560
about that

2407
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:43,840
but the first few chapters are how to

2408
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:44,800
use unix

2409
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:48,080
like as written by a 1980s person and

2410
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:51,199
and i love the simplicity of it because

2411
01:46:51,199 --> 01:46:53,520
the exact details have changed a lot

2412
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:54,239
over time

2413
01:46:54,239 --> 01:46:57,119
like how do i configure uh networking on

2414
01:46:57,119 --> 01:46:58,239
red hat seven

2415
01:46:58,239 --> 01:47:00,639
you know is is totally new but the

2416
01:47:00,639 --> 01:47:02,880
details of like how do i view a file how

2417
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:04,560
do i list my directories

2418
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:08,080
stuff like that has all stayed the same

2419
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:09,920
over time and it's got a very clear

2420
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:11,760
writing style

2421
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:14,080
so i'm going to try and get a link to

2422
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:14,880
that too

2423
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:17,520
just because i uh just because i think

2424
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:19,440
it's a great

2425
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:21,600
it's i think it's still a great

2426
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:23,119
reference

2427
01:47:23,119 --> 01:47:26,320
it looks like the the used price of it

2428
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:29,600
is still around ten dollars

2429
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:32,239
it's been out of print since a long time

2430
01:47:32,239 --> 01:47:32,719
ago

2431
01:47:32,719 --> 01:47:36,000
but uh there's a a billion copies of it

2432
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,080
floating around it's called the unix

2433
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:39,440
programming environment

2434
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:41,199
there's a million other there's a

2435
01:47:41,199 --> 01:47:43,040
million other books if you like books

2436
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:43,520
for like

2437
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:47,360
intro to how to use unix but

2438
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:50,320
this one happens to be my favorite which

2439
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:52,159
tells you something about the book and

2440
01:47:52,159 --> 01:47:54,239
also tells you something about me

2441
01:47:54,239 --> 01:47:57,520
so i hope that uh i hope that this has

2442
01:47:57,520 --> 01:47:58,480
been fun

2443
01:47:58,480 --> 01:48:01,280
i'm i'm gonna drop off but uh we've got

2444
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:02,719
some great links here

2445
01:48:02,719 --> 01:48:06,080
in the chat for some some linux things

2446
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:08,480
thanks a lot for asking interesting

2447
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:09,280
questions

2448

and have fun at the ctf um

2449
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:14,320
if you uh if you want to start to learn

2450
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:15,840
something about kubernetes i highly

2451
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:17,440
recommend you check out challenge number

2452
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:18,800
19 the vm called

2453
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:22,159

okay um thanks everyone

2460
01:48:38,719 --> 01:48:40,880
