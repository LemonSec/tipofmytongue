00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,400
i'm going to turn it over to tracy we'll

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,240
do q a at the end

29
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,000
all yours thank you hey folks thanks for

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,720
joining me

31
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,799
um for those of you who have heard me

32
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:17,840
speak before this

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,680
is definitely a different topic than i'm

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,200
used to presenting on

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,280
um one of the things i have talked to a

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,119
lot of people coming into tech and even

37
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,640
people who've been here a long time

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,119
is that salary negotiations salary

39
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,880
offers especially when you get to high

40
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,759
tech can be

41
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,920
really complicated and sometimes

42
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,960
especially women

43
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,759
aren't always given the tools to

44
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,759
negotiate those offers with confidence

45
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,520
and to understand the terminology that's

46
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,399
presented

47
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,079
because if you're like me and you grew

48
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,079
up in a house world house where women

49
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,840
didn't talk about money or maybe you

50
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,040
just weren't exposed to that

51
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,920
growing up like i wasn't then this talk

52
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,280
i think will be really helpful in

53
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,880
hopefully getting your next job and

54
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,880
getting paid like a boss

55
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,680
so let's start with our overview um

56
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,399
introduction

57
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,079
we're gonna talk some vocabulary words

58
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,759
there's a lot of vocabulary words in

59
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:04,159
this

60
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,000
it's a little dry but i'll try and keep

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,920
it interesting we're gonna actually look

62
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,959
at different offers

63
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,800
i'm gonna look at a couple offers that

64
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,239
are modeled on like some of the

65
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,599
companies you're gonna see

66
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,000
in the real world that i have hidden the

67
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,920
names to protect the innocent but if you

68
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,360
do a little digging you should be able

69
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,599
to figure out which ones are which

70
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,640
uh then we're gonna go over some

71
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,640
negotiating tips and then

72
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,400
at the end i'll take questions and

73
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
hopefully this will be useful to you

74
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,000
going forward

75
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,319
uh okay so who who is this chick why am

76
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,280
i listening to her

77
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,840
why am i here um like i said my name's

78
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,400
tracy

79
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,560
i've got almost 20 years experience in

80
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,440
tech which is

81
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,000
soul crushing when i say it out loud um

82
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,080
i've done both private and public sector

83
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,000
i worked for the government for a while

84
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,680
i did missile defense

85
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,000
i did counter intelligence so if you see

86
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,120
any of the

87
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,040
theories running around about me being a

88
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,120
spy that's probably where that came from

89
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,040
still not a spy i know that's what a spy

90
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,879
would say we

91
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,200
run into this circle a lot i've worked

92
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,680
for two of the fang companies um

93
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,400
alphabet and now amazon and a host of

94
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,000
other tech companies

95
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,800
uh microsoft adobe twitter i also ran my

96
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,879
own consultancy company for three years

97
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,640
uh so i've been on the other side of pay

98
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,480
negotiations and hiring

99
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,720
i'm the daughter of two stock brokers

100
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,239
and the reason this is relevant is

101
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,920
because while i was surrounded by all

102
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,120
this financial

103
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,720
um sort of talk and financial literacy

104
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,120
a lot of it never percolated down to me

105
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,319
because

106
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,319
my family was extremely traditional and

107
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,599
sometimes um

108
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,959
they just didn't really honestly think

109
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,720
i'd ever have to deal with this so

110
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,680
i didn't learn about stocks and bonds

111
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,440
and how to save for retirement until i

112
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,319
was much older

113
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,560
um but i have successfully negotiated

114
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,400
seven offers in tech in the last

115
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,400
15 or so years you'll notice that the 20

116
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,159
years and the 15 years don't add up

117
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,920
because five of it was in the military

118
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,680
where i got paid nothing so

119
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,040
i don't really count that as

120
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,200
successfully negotiating an offer

121
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,159
um okay so there's a lot to cover in

122
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,319
this and there are a ton of words and a

123
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,519
lot of math

124
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,200
you're not going to get it all just in

125
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,959
this talk i've got a link at the very

126
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,720
end to the slides you're going to want

127
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,640
to go back and rerun the numbers

128
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,480
it's just a lot to take in in 40 minutes

129
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,400
so that's okay if you missed something

130
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,079
i'm happy to take questions at the end

131
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,478
but

132
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,680
it's okay all right

133
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,479
there we go okay so your base salary

134
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,759
everyone should be familiar with this

135
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,040
your base salary is

136
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,320
what you get paid on a bi-weekly monthly

137
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,080
but what comes in your paycheck it's

138
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,160
guaranteed to you income unless you get

139
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,960
fired

140
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,199
um there's no you know sort of vesting

141
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,040
period there's nothing that you have to

142
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,800
do to get this money it's part of what

143
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,400
they're going to pay you on a reliable

144
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,440
schedule

145
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,759
sign-on bonuses some of you may be lucky

146
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,440
enough to negotiate an offer with a

147
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,560
sign-on bonus

148
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,600
it's generally a one-time or pro-rated

149
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,680
lump sum so basically a company says

150
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,400
hey we really really want you so we go

151
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,080
we're going to pay you 20 000

152
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,360
to come over to our company it's a

153
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,199
one-time cash payment

154
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,280
um annual bonuses are usually a

155
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,039
performance rated bonus

156
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,360
uh sometimes it's a flat sum most often

157
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,039
it's tied to your performance and

158
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,280
depending on the company the formula can

159
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,000
get

160
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,479
a little wonky because some of them have

161
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,400
things like oh well half your bonus is

162
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,000
based on your performance

163
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,360
and half your bonus is based on the

164
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,840
company performance your performance can

165
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,320
be incredibly subjective to your manager

166
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,320
and company performance is largely out

167
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,000
of most people's control unless you're

168
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,759
operating at a c-suite level

169
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,360
and then you probably need an entirely

170
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,120
different presentation than this one

171
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,039
um insurance so this is your medical

172
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,800
your dental your short-term disability

173
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,120
your long-term disability your vision

174
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,960
all of the things that help you be

175
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,800
healthy stay healthy

176
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,759
uh time off in vacations pretty

177
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,320
self-explanatory but there's some

178
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,080
different sort of schemes on how they do

179
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,880
that

180
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,120
um retirement contributions and plans i

181
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,479
find that people overlook

182
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,600
this one the most because people just

183
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,520
kind of think oh it's retirement it's a

184
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,759
long way away they have a 401k

185
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,479
and whatever it's fine your retirement

186
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,240
contributions can actually add up to

187
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,160
thousands of dollars over the course of

188
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,080
your employment so it's really important

189
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,800
to pay attention to your employer match

190
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,520
your employer

191
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,639
employer plan and how they administrate

192
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,800
all right so now you have this offer in

193
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,080
front of you and you have a sign-on

194
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,600
bonus so what questions should you be

195
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,280
asking about sign-on bonus

196
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,840
when am i going to get it most companies

197
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,600
pay it up front um either on date of

198
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,360
higher or 30 days post

199
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,280
but some companies make you wait a year

200
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,039
two years i've even seen as long as five

201
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,039
years to get your sign-on bonus

202
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,280
really important to understand how long

203
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,240
you have to stay there

204
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,000
to get that money and when it's coming

205
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
in um i've seen a lot of folks that come

206
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,440
new to the industry

207
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,000
that say okay i've got to sign in bonus

208
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,880
that's you know 40

209
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,120
000 so i'm gonna go buy a condo and i

210
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,400
know i'm gonna get my sign on bonus and

211
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,360
that's cool

212
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,720
they don't realize maybe it doesn't come

213
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,479
for six months and now they've got this

214
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,919
you know down payment over their heads

215
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,360
that they can't pay anymore because they

216
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,599
were anticipating a sign-on bonus

217
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,919
when do i have to pay it back um for

218
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,360
those of you who know me

219
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,960
you'll know that i recently left a job

220
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,120
after a pretty short tenure

221
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,360
and i got a nice little letter from them

222
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,120
saying hey you didn't make it your full

223
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,120
year please pay us back 25

224
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,759
of our sign-on bonus good to know i did

225
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,800
know that before i

226
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,319
quit the job but i have seen people

227
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,400
surprised by this figure out how long

228
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,440
you have to stay and

229
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,440
if it's prorated which and what that

230
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,039
means is some companies are all or

231
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:21,680
nothing

232
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,000
means if you don't stay a year you pay

233
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,240
the whole bonus back no questions asked

234
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,160
some companies like my company it's a

235
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,319
prorated schedule which means for every

236
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,080
month you stay you get to keep a certain

237
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,840
percentage of it so if you stay

238
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,240
nine months maybe you get to keep 75 of

239
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,319
it so that's really really important to

240
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,599
understand

241
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,280
ask them what tax method they use

242
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,840
depending on how your income is situated

243
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,440
this can make a big difference in how

244
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,039
much of your sign-on bonus

245
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,319
gets paid to uncle sam um and

246
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,840
that can affect what you actually take

247
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,440
home in that check there's two different

248
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,960
methods for calculating

249
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,960
bonus taxes i'm not going to get into

250
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,080
them here because that's a whole nother

251
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,720
lecture

252
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,560
but basically one is higher one is lower

253
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,319
figure out which one your company uses

254
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,080
and then you can better anticipate your

255
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,520
sign-on bonus

256
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,360
um you notice that they have an annual

257
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,039
bonus structure well what's the schedule

258
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,000
is it every year

259
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,400
is it every quarter is it tied to sales

260
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,319
goals is it tied to something

261
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,400
that i have control over that i don't

262
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,360
have control over

263
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,080
people sometimes depend on their annual

264
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,720
bonuses

265
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,960
not realizing that there can be things

266
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,199
you have absolutely no control over

267
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,280
that affect your bonus and that money is

268
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,520
not guaranteed to you

269
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,520
this is the question i wish i'd asked

270
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,559
when i

271
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,640
joined my very first tech company they

272
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,399
said well your bonus is 15

273
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,399
of your pay i said cool i'm a pretty

274
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,240
high performer i do good work

275
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,000
i mean obviously i'm gonna get at the

276
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,679
top of the range i mean that's just an

277
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,480
obvious

278
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,000
well it turns out the manager i worked

279
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,519
for kind of a jerk

280
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,680
um because of the way the bonuses were

281
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,519
divvied up he knew that if he gave

282
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,519
everyone lower than him a lower bonus he

283
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,760
could give himself and other managers a

284
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,800
higher bonus

285
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,399
so it's really important to ask what the

286
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,320
historical average for bonuses are in

287
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,680
the group because if you're in a group

288
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,600
that gives historically low bonuses you

289
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,680
should know about that

290
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,080
all right insurance this is super

291
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,800
important and

292
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,120
really often overlooked what specific

293
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,560
plans do you offer

294
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,279
um when i was younger and healthier i

295
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,800
didn't really so much care about these

296
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,519
things

297
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,600
um because i didn't really go to the

298
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,800
doctor that much it wasn't that

299
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,839
important

300
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,519
last year some of you guys know i had a

301
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,880
bunch of health problems

302
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,480
i i paid a lot of medical bills

303
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,080
knowing which plans are available and

304
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,839
which doctors i can see is incredibly

305
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,279
important to me now

306
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,800
you may not think it's important to you

307
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,399
because baby you are also young and

308
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:36,959
healthy

309
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,480
but if you get pregnant if you have a

310
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,519
complication

311
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,839
from a fall or an accident suddenly your

312
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,040
medical bills can look

313
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,000
quite different if you're planning on

314
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,040
becoming pregnant

315
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,200
if you happen to be trans if you have

316
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,399
mental health issues

317
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,760
you need to know if those things are

318
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,519
covered by these plans because you don't

319
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,360
want to be tied into a plan that doesn't

320
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,640
fit your needs because that can be

321
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,000
thousands of dollars

322
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,880
out of pocket for you every single year

323
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,000
also understand how they

324
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,880
do the payments per person per period so

325
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,839
for example

326
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,640
uh the last company i worked it was i

327
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,920
think i paid like 30

328
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,839
or something like that for me and then

329
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,760
it was plus family and that could be my

330
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,320
husband

331
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,519
and you know 25 children if i hop um

332
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,240
my husband's plan is him and then when

333
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,680
you go to me it adds some money

334
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,200
when you add one child it adds some more

335
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,720
money when you add two children it adds

336
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,399
more money and it keeps going up to like

337
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,360
eight children

338
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,959
so that can really affect if you have a

339
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,880
big family understand how much your

340
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,320
payment is going to be

341
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,800
that you're paying in in premiums each

342
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,760
month

343
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,720
time off less important to some people

344
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,560
as i get older time off becomes very

345
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,839
important to me

346
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,920
um how many days how many days do you

347
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,360
get this is a pretty easy one

348
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,680
um what's really interesting now um for

349
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,120
example i used to work at twitter we had

350
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,720
unlimited pto

351
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,640
grade in theory uh depends really

352
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,399
heavily on your manager my manager was

353
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,160
awesome i got to take advantage of it

354
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,560
and have a really flexible pto schedule

355
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,320
i've also worked at companies where i

356
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
didn't have that option and at the end

357
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,399
of my tenure there i didn't have any

358
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,560
payback i didn't have any you know

359
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,480
time off sitting in a bank waiting to be

360
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,880
paid out to me it was just what it was

361
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,959
um ask if sick days are separate or if

362
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,240
it's all lumped in together

363
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,440
um for those of you who may have medical

364
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,320
conditions

365
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,800
this is really important because if you

366
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,320
have to take only sick days for sick

367
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,240
days and only pay days for paydays then

368
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,880
it can be

369
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,959
a lot harder trying to manage your time

370
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,800
do i get sick or do i go on vacation do

371
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,560
i give up my vacation so that i can be

372
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,200
sick

373
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,120
it just really is important to reflect

374
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,880
on your lifestyle and figure out

375
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,920
what that means to you all right

376
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,320
uh so what's the average days off per

377
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,120
year

378
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,040
taken well okay so this is hard to

379
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,800
answer and a lot of companies don't know

380
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,160
but you can kind of get a feeling from

381
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,360
your boss so

382
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,279
i asked when i joined and my boss said

383
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,519
you know most people take two weeks off

384
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,120
around christmas and most people take

385
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,480
two weeks off in the summer

386
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,760
this is important because it lets you

387
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,839
know how your manager feels about taking

388
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:02,880
time off because

389
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,639
all the time off in the world isn't

390
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,320
gonna help you if your manager won't let

391
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,600
you take it

392
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,920
um ask about parental uh leave

393
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,440
disability sick leave

394
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,920
uh for example for those of you who know

395
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,560
um

396
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,000
about i developed a heart condition two

397
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,160
years ago i was at google our short-term

398
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,320
disability and long-term disability paid

399
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,279
eighty percent

400
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,480
and sixty percent respectively of my pay

401
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,399
which is really really good most people

402
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,760
in the industry don't pay that high for

403
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,680
short-term and long-term disability

404
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,959
but even so 40 of my pay was a huge cut

405
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,720
um so understand that if you get sick

406
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,480
that you know may affect

407
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,320
how you're able to continue to afford

408
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,160
things especially if you have medical

409
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,680
bills

410
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,079
all right

411
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,720
retirement contributions this is my

412
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,480
favorite because people overlook it

413
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,399
what is your retirement plan who manages

414
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,680
it and i know somebody out there is

415
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,720
going i don't care

416
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,560
fidelity uh you know whatever pick a

417
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,920
pick a company it doesn't really matter

418
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,399
to me but those different companies

419
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,320
have different fee schedules and that

420
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,760
can affect how much money you're

421
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,279
actually saving versus how much you're

422
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,800
paying a broker

423
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,959
what's the matching percentage uh there

424
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,320
are companies out there that pay a

425
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,360
hundred percent match

426
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,240
up to the irs limit that can be ten ten

427
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,920
thousand dollars a year almost

428
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,079
some companies only do a four percent

429
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,279
match i've seen some

430
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,440
companies do a one percent match

431
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,440
suddenly all of these like five ten

432
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,880
thousand dollar things that you don't

433
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,639
really think of start adding up to real

434
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,920
money

435
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,920
all right when can i begin contributing

436
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,839
um so this is important because

437
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,760
you can't some

438
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,040
companies won't allow you to contribute

439
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,800
for up to 90 days

440
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,120
um some companies won't let you keep

441
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,920
what you have

442
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,920
up to after a year there's a bunch of

443
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,000
rules around this most tech companies

444
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,680
say you can start contributing right

445
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,639
away

446
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,680
um but just double check um vesting

447
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,240
period

448
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,480
so vesting period means when you put the

449
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,519
money in

450
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,279
how long do you have to stay with the

451
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,680
company in order to get it

452
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,680
um what are the plan options what are my

453
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,560
fees can i do a roth ira can i

454
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,720
do you know no load mutual funds can i

455
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,240
do things that aren't going to cost me

456
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,839
money every month

457
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:16,320
all right

458
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,680
all right equity or stock um

459
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,760
so shares of a company that are granted

460
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,360
to you upon completion of a specific

461
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,959
tenure and that's really wordy way of

462
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:25,839
saying

463
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,639
they give you either shares or promises

464
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,800
of shares as a way of incentivizing you

465
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,320
to stay with the company

466
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,800
um there's restricted stock units so

467
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,720
restricted stockiness aren't

468
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,839
actually shares of the company until

469
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,199
they're actually granted to you so it's

470
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,800
not like they give them to you

471
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,079
you actually have to wait till your

472
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,079
vesting period clears you also have

473
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:46,560
stock

474
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,800
options which are the promise to be able

475
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,519
to buy stocks at a certain rate

476
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,160
um these are really complicated and

477
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,440
we're actually going to talk about them

478
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,880
a little bit later

479
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,680
um so just making sure everyone can hear

480
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,000
me

481
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,639
never hear me still go okay

482
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,639
all right um and then stock refresh so

483
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:11,760
stock refresh

484
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,800
is basically at the end of every year

485
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,560
do you get more stock options do you get

486
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,040
more

487
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,560
stocks themselves how does that work for

488
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,079
you know your company and how does that

489
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,480
work when you're going for your annual

490
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,320
performance and stuff

491
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,720
um so when you start getting equity

492
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,759
compensation

493
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,000
um offers you have to ask them what type

494
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,839
of equity compensation

495
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,000
is it so that means

496
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,639
do i get actual stocks actual shares do

497
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,040
i get

498
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,839
options do i get rsus is my stock

499
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:46,639
restricted

500
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,800
how much of the stock have you given out

501
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,480
um these are really important to

502
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,519
understand because

503
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,199
if you a lot of your compensation

504
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,240
is in stock and that stock is

505
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,959
not valuable let's say that you joined

506
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:01,920
enron

507
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,160
uh those folks had a lot of stock in

508
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,839
enron and then when the company went

509
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,199
belly up

510
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,680
it was not so valuable people lost

511
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,880
literally their entire life savings

512
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,800
um when you get into restricted stocks

513
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,920
and rsus

514
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,839
what are the restrictions some companies

515
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,360
have blackout periods and what that

516
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,079
means is

517
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,399
here's your grant of rsu's but you can't

518
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,199
sell them for

519
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,399
three months six months two years um

520
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,560
if you're counting on that at the end of

521
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,000
the year or the beginning of the year

522
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,600
and then you find out that you have 90

523
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
days that you have to hold this money

524
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,759
it basically isn't any good to you so

525
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,240
figure out how long you have to actually

526
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,800
hold them in order to be valuable do you

527
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,680
have a plan to cover

528
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,440
taxes i've seen so many people get

529
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,959
burned on this if you get a hundred

530
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,639
thousand dollar stock grant

531
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,560
and then you sell that stock you owe

532
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,399
uncle sam a piece of that money

533
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,160
and if you haven't planned for it you

534
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,480
can get a really nasty tax bill

535
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,079
and it's a huge surprise for a lot of

536
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,160
people some companies do really well

537
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:58,639
with this

538
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,639
and they will sell shares to cover your

539
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,480
taxes or they'll take a deduction out of

540
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,680
your payroll

541
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,000
there's a ton of stuff that companies

542
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,599
can do but a lot of companies

543
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,039
don't do so it's really important to

544
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,880
understand how that works

545
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,640
um okay pre-ipo stock this is where it

546
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,880
gets a little funky if you go to work

547
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,480
for a startup they can give you what's

548
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,799
called pre-ipo stock which means that

549
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,559
this stock is essentially worthless

550
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,119
right now

551
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,199
but they're promising you that when it

552
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,199
goes into an initial public offering it

553
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,880
will be worth something

554
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,600
now that because it's not actually

555
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,000
graded

556
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,160
by the market everything in pre-ipo

557
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,160
stock is kind of somebody's guess as to

558
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,320
how much it might be worth so if you're

559
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,080
getting pre-ipo stock

560
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,679
understand that it could be worth a lot

561
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,440
or it could be worth absolutely nothing

562
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,000
i had

563
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,080
friends that went to a certain media

564
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,120
company that got offered 1.2 million

565
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,320
1.8 million in pre-ipo stock that ended

566
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,360
up being worth

567
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,720
about a hundred thousand dollars when

568
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,400
all was said and done so you can imagine

569
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,160
the nasty pay surprise

570
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,760
when you were expecting 1.8 million

571
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,080
and got a hundred thousand that's that's

572
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,200
not so good

573
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,720
so um for ipo stock ask when their next

574
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,840
valuation period is

575
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,960
and how much time it is until then

576
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,640
because if the company's not doing well

577
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,480
and the valuation period is a long way

578
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,200
off

579
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,200
you don't want to take the chance i

580
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,240
wouldn't want to take the chance that

581
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,080
that stock is going to go down

582
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,720
um stock options so we're going to go

583
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,400
through an example later on that i think

584
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,320
will be super helpful um

585
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,559
but what is the percentage of the

586
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,960
company you've given in stock because

587
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,559
that affects how much those stocks are

588
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,400
actually going to be worth when you buy

589
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,120
them

590
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,880
um there's a whole other presentation

591
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,240
that should probably be done on stocks

592
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,919
and stock options and i don't go super

593
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,520
deep into it but i would encourage you

594
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,480
to look up

595
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,720
the ramifications of how much stock

596
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,840
options

597
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,520
actually mean to you depending on how

598
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,160
many stocks have actually been allocated

599
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,400
when do i have to exercise my options do

600
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,240
i have to exercise them so

601
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,480
if i have ten thousand dollars in

602
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,440
options

603
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,840
and the stock tanks do i still have to

604
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,200
buy them at that higher price

605
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,960
if i do that might not be a great deal

606
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,360
for me um what happens if i

607
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,440
our company gets bought by somebody else

608
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,520
do my options go away do you honor them

609
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,280
does it become the new stock price for

610
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,320
the new company

611
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,679
there's a lot of things to understand

612
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,200
about stock options because they're

613
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,240
promises of stock in the future

614
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,160
um we talked a little bit about besting

615
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,840
what's the vesting schedule for stocks

616
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,280
do i have to stay a year

617
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,880
two years three years what's the

618
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,720
percentage some companies

619
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,080
have really uh let's call it company

620
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,200
favorable vesting

621
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
schedules so for example one of the

622
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,799
major um tech giant companies has a 5

623
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,400
15 25 25 and so

624
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,000
if you stay a year you only get five

625
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,520
percent of your total grant

626
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,799
other companies do a 25 25 25 25 so for

627
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,480
every year you stay you get a quarter of

628
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,440
your stock

629
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,799
if you're not planning on staying the

630
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,640
whole four years or five years

631
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,480
that can be a lot of money that you're

632
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,240
leaving on the table

633
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,240
um what is the policy for stock refresh

634
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,240
what does what does that mean so like at

635
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,400
certain companies they take

636
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,120
um your stock and they count the

637
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,440
appreciation based on

638
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,120
like if you got the stock at five

639
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,400
dollars and now it's worth fifteen

640
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,039
dollars

641
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,400
they multiply all your shares and

642
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,520
they're like well then we don't need to

643
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,200
give you a pay increase because the

644
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,000
stock went up so

645
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,520
much um so that can be a big bummer

646
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,760
other companies want to keep competitive

647
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,600
with their offers so they will actually

648
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,520
give you more stock just to make sure

649
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,280
that you stay

650
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,799
all right so when i first agreed to do

651
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:35,840
this talk

652
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,559
i um honestly did not anticipate having

653
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,600
to do this much math

654
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,080
in the entire year that i i was planning

655
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,200
on being around

656
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,159
but here we go this is more math than

657
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,760
you'll probably do in a year i usually

658
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,280
make my husband who's an accountant do

659
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,919
these for my job offers but just for you

660
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,600
i went and did all the maths all right

661
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,280
so we have aisha she is a software

662
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,640
engineer she's got five years of

663
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,440
experience

664
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,720
and she's got three competing offers

665
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,640
oh two competing offers sorry i was

666
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,240
doing three and then it got complicated

667
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,280
i went down to two

668
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,440
ignore that it's not there uh so company

669
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,480
a offers her a base salary of 140 000

670
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,440
and a sign-on bonus of 25 000 a stock

671
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:15,919
grant of

672
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,440
20 000 an annual bonus of up to 20

673
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,039
15 days pto a retirement contribution is

674
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:23,840
50

675
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,679
up to the irs limit for most people the

676
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,320
irs limit will be around 19

677
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,000
500 i think it's gone up a little bit

678
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,520
since i last checked

679
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,240
um company b hundred and thirty ten

680
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,919
thousand hundred thousand

681
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,880
no annual bonus question mark on stock

682
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,240
bonus refresh

683
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,919
basically they don't have a policy they

684
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,440
might do it they might not

685
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,000
pto is ten days and retirement is fifty

686
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,520
percent up to four percent of your

687
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,240
salary

688
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,919
so like i said that's a lot of math but

689
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,080
if you just look at the first year

690
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,720
it looks like it's pretty obvious which

691
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,159
offer you would take right obviously

692
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,200
it'd be company a

693
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,600
because they pay a lot more but it gets

694
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,600
a little more complicated when you look

695
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,240
at the total four-year compensation

696
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,080
as you can see because of the way the

697
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,400
stock fest for company b

698
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,720
you almost invert your pay scale so if

699
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,480
you stay to year three

700
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,840
you're actually making a hundred and

701
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,320
seventy thousand dollars for longer

702
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,799
if you were to quit after two years then

703
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,559
you'd be about the same you'd actually

704
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,559
make a little bit more with company a

705
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,080
so that's why it's really important to

706
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,080
understand how

707
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,240
long you're going to stay with a company

708
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,679
and how much

709
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,159
you actually count your stock as part of

710
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,840
your compensation

711
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,679
this is assuming by the way that the

712
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,840
stocks remains the same

713
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,240
or goes up because if the stock value

714
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,120
goes down

715
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,400
then that can also drop this back down

716
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,520
all right all right so

717
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,600
now let's compare some potential offers

718
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,280
the reason i say potential is because

719
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,280
this depends on your actions

720
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,200
so i'm going to assume that you're a

721
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,720
diligent employee and you're going to

722
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,120
pre

723
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,640
you're going to contribute nine percent

724
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,960
of your salary to your 401k

725
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,400
um the first company matches 15 and then

726
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
they give you 15 days which is

727
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,840
equivalent to roughly eight thousand

728
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,000
dollars um based on your salary

729
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,840
company b you're gonna contribute the

730
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,919
same nine percent but they only match

731
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:14,640
fifty percent

732
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,520
up to four percent so that is twenty six

733
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,400
hundred dollars

734
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,840
so this starts to nudge your

735
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,039
compensation up even more in company a

736
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,320
but that only happens if you contribute

737
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,520
to your 401k if you contribute zero then

738
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,720
this six thousand dollars goes away um

739
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,640
and then on the pto days some folks

740
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,480
don't count this i like to look at my

741
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,080
time as valuable and so i like to be

742
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,200
paid for it

743
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,240
uh pto days are meaningful to me uh

744
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,279
you have to figure out if that's

745
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,799
something that's worth it to calculate

746
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,279
for your compensation

747
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,440
all right so once we put that in it

748
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,880
starts to kind of

749
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,039
gentle this curve but you still end up

750
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,520
making a lot more years three and four

751
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,640
with company b i know there's a lot of

752
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,000
math here i promise

753
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,760
i promise once you get ahold of the

754
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,240
slides it'll be a lot easier

755
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,080
all right so now let's get weird let's

756
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,080
figure out what happens

757
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,400
when things out of your control happen

758
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,919
what do i mean by that

759
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,400
okay so let's assume that you were

760
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,000
offered company a stock

761
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,960
that was dollars a share by the way

762
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,600
these are

763
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,320
definitely not based on real companies

764
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,679
with real numbers

765
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,360
um so let's assume the company a had 141

766
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,440
share value after four years it's now

767
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,039
valued at 158

768
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,039
dollars a share that means that the

769
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,559
original stock grant that they gave you

770
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,400
of twenty thousand dollars is now worth

771
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
twenty two thousand two seventy eight

772
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,799
so that bumps your four year stock sorry

773
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,480
your four year total compensation up to

774
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,919
six hundred and sixty four thousand

775
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,600
seven hundred and fifty eight

776
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,919
however company b stock was originally

777
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,760
offered at 536 a share

778
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,880
after four years is now valued at 1869

779
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,000
dollars a share for a total of 347

780
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,279
634 which means your total for your comp

781
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,600
is nine hundred thousand i'm sorry nine

782
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,600
hundred eight thousand and fifty dollars

783
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,480
so that is substantially bigger than

784
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,840
company a

785
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,559
but that assumes the stock goes up if it

786
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,760
goes down

787
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,600
it could be worth zero you could have

788
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,200
all the stock in the world and if it's

789
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,799
not worth anything then it doesn't

790
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:17,760
actually matter

791
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,240
to your base compensation the reason i

792
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,760
say this the reason that i think this is

793
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,039
super important

794
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,360
is because a lot of people predicate a

795
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,799
large portion of their pay

796
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,840
based on their equity you can't eat

797
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,400
equity i can't pay my mortgage with the

798
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,320
promise of future stocks

799
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,120
i can't pay my mortgage based on trust

800
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,720
me the stock has always been valuable

801
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,000
and will never go down

802
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,240
maybe that's true mostly that's true in

803
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,000
a lot of companies you can do research

804
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,760
to sort of guess that that will continue

805
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,960
to be true

806
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,799
but not always so you can't count on it

807
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,600
100 so understand your risk tolerance

808
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,039
and understand how that affects your

809
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,039
total compensation

810
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,080
all right let's talk about kia she's a

811
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,440
program manager she's got 12 years

812
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,080
experience

813
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,520
two competing offers this slide was

814
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,279
correct unlike the other one

815
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,640
i'm not going to walk you through all of

816
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,960
these but net net you have a total

817
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,080
one-year compensation of 195 total one

818
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,760
year compensation for company b

819
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,440
of 207 i'll give you a minute or two to

820
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,039
digest that and then we'll go on

821
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,880
and i know i'm talking really fast and

822
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,960
throwing a lot of stuff at you

823
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,080
but um

824
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,840
there's there's so much density in this

825
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,120
presentation i want to make sure we get

826
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,320
through it and then hopefully have time

827
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,000
for questions after

828
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,720
all right so same thing here as you can

829
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,120
see

830
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,840
you start to invert that growth growth

831
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,480
curve

832
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,559
based on how long it takes your stock to

833
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,000
vest

834
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,120
now there's not as much difference

835
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,960
so depending on like work life balance

836
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,200
and vacation maybe it's worth it to you

837
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,760
um but here's some hidden factors that

838
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,159
you may not see so company a looks like

839
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,159
it's lower in total compensation

840
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,480
because they give you stock options

841
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,720
stock options mean you have to pay money

842
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,480
to get money this particular company

843
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,919
will actually give you five percent of

844
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,039
your base salary

845
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,799
and then you can buy literally your

846
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,880
entire salary is worth of their stock

847
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,880
options they don't have a cap on it

848
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,880
but again this is hoping that the stock

849
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,159
goes up if the stock

850
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,240
goes down then you have literally spent

851
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,400
money and got nothing in return

852
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,000
so that's why it's really hard to

853
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,440
compare these offers you have to

854
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,720
understand their risk

855
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,960
profile so let's take company a they're

856
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,880
the ones that gave you the stock options

857
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,720
um let's assume that they give me my

858
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,360
five percent um so that's roughly 27

859
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:29,840
shares

860
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,000
um strike price means what the stock is

861
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,720
selling for

862
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,080
the day that i get granted the option so

863
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,039
i exercise that a year later at 480 the

864
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:41,840
stock's gone up

865
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,200
yay me i make 12 960

866
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,360
or let's say i feel a little more risky

867
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,559
with company a

868
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,039
i decide to kick in an additional ten

869
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,880
thousand dollars of my own money

870
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,080
and i get another 28 shares so same

871
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,039
strike price

872
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,200
same exercise price now i have a profit

873
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,320
of sixteen thousand

874
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,960
four hundred dollars so you can see that

875
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,039
that pushes my total compensation up by

876
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,159
quite a bit

877
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,720
um but this is only if the stock goes up

878
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,320
if the stock goes down i have literally

879
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,840
just given them 10 000

880
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,240
and gotten basically nothing back now i

881
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,919
will get some of that returned if the

882
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,200
stock doesn't go

883
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,279
so low that it's worthless but it will

884
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,559
be somewhere between ten thousand

885
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,520
dollars and zero

886
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,360
so you can see with that that when you

887
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,360
compare company a and company b in the

888
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,080
first year

889
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,840
if you do the middle option if you give

890
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,159
more of your money to the stock options

891
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,760
and they go up this is where that

892
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,200
branching logic comes in

893
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,120
then you're actually coming out of head

894
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,720
if those stocks options go

895
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,279
down you could actually fall below this

896
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,320
base pay rate

897
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,480
that means that this purple chunk this

898
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,840
guaranteed chunk

899
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,520
becomes no longer guaranteed because

900
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,120
you're choosing to give money into a

901
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,600
stock option plan

902
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,799
all right so that's a bunch of stuff

903
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:55,600
thrown at you

904
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,159
there's a bunch of offers now let's talk

905
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,760
about once you have your offer

906
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,600
how do you actually negotiate and get

907
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,520
what you're worth

908
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,600
uh do your research figure out how many

909
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,679
years of experience you have and i think

910
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,360
this is so important especially when i

911
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,200
speak to groups of women

912
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,919
we tend to say okay well the job says i

913
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,000
need to have 10 years of experience as a

914
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,640
as a c-sharp programmer and well i mean

915
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,080
i only have nine and a half years

916
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,559
experience as a java programmer

917
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,320
okay maybe you don't have exactly 10

918
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,360
years as a c-sharp programmer but java

919
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,720
you're close enough you have been

920
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,640
programming for 10 years

921
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,360
java is gonna get you at least halfway

922
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:33,679
there

923
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,679
don't discount that as experience if it

924
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,520
doesn't meet exactly don't just throw it

925
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,399
away

926
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,320
um lean on your network one of the most

927
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,840
important things that i've learned is to

928
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,120
be able to call people in other

929
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:43,760
companies

930
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,960
um when i was negotiating for one of my

931
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,600
jobs

932
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,360
recently i called somebody that worked

933
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,720
in the company i said hey

934
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,080
this is the offer they gave me is that

935
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,760
pretty standard from what you've seen

936
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,039
and they were able to connect to me with

937
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,640
other people in that company who had the

938
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,600
same job

939
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,159
and most of them were really um

940
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,000
forthcoming and really

941
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,360
kind enough to kind of walk me through

942
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,039
those offers i

943
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,760
really believe especially as women and

944
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,200
especially as minorities

945
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,240
we need to work together to share salary

946
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,880
information because it's the only way to

947
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,440
uncover pay inequities the only way that

948
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,039
we actually start moving the needle on

949
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,240
this stuff

950
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,840
um sites like glassdoor levels.fyi and

951
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,840
linkedin are really good sources of data

952
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,200
but you'll find as you get towards the

953
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,120
higher end of the pay scale their

954
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,360
veracity starts to break down and

955
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,640
anybody who does data science for a

956
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,919
living can tell you that that's because

957
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,440
there are fewer people in that bucket so

958
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,120
the data becomes a little wonky

959
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,200
but just understand that for most folks

960
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,279
probably in the like junior to mid level

961
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,640
they're great once you go

962
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,320
above senior it starts to get a little

963
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,559
less reliable

964
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,159
all right remember aisha she's back

965
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,919
all right so we're going to take her two

966
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,799
offers she's got company a

967
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,799
oh sorry that was 170 000 is her total

968
00:30:58,799 --> 00:30:59,360
comp

969
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,559
so she goes out to levels.fyi and she

970
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:03,200
looks up

971
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,799
the type of engineer that she's going to

972
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,399
be so

973
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,720
i put back end in full stack um because

974
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,760
there wasn't a lot of

975
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,039
either so i wanted to kind of get a

976
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,000
cross section so you'll see that 170

977
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,600
is actually pretty okay-ish it's not

978
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,320
great

979
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,559
but it's right in the middle of a 61 or

980
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:21,919
a 62

981
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,000
at a certain company anyone who's worked

982
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,200
that company probably looks at this and

983
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,880
goes oh i know which company this is

984
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,440
if you don't just google level 61 tech

985
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,480
and it'll pop up

986
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,559
um she wants to negotiate when she gets

987
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,600
her offer

988
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,240
she wants to be pushing to be a 62 if

989
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,120
she can

990
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,880
because this is the thing i wish i would

991
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,960
have known when i went to tech

992
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,720
i got such a significant raise coming

993
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,840
out of government that i was like i

994
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,440
don't care what level i am it's totally

995
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,320
fine

996
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,960
um it totally does matter i got put in

997
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,240
as a pm2

998
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,880
with 10 years of experience um everyone

999
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,399
else at my level had less than three

1000
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:55,440
years of experience

1001
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,320
and it actually drastically affected my

1002
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,039
total pay

1003
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,559
and my promotion cadence it's really

1004
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,559
really messed me up for a long time i

1005
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,159
ended up getting paid less

1006
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,320
for several years just because i didn't

1007
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,360
ask this question

1008
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,679
ask what level it is ask what the pay

1009
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,480
bans are

1010
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,080
in the state of california in washington

1011
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,840
they are required by law to give you a

1012
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,000
pay range so please ask for the pay

1013
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,039
range

1014
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,399
um next one

1015
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:26,159
all right so now you figured out kind of

1016
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:27,919
what your compensation is and if it's

1017
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:28,880
fair or not

1018
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,080
but you really want to see if you can

1019
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,080
get the most possible money

1020
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,000
out of this company that you can because

1021
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,080
gosh darn it you're worth it

1022
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,799
um so the rule is always negotiate

1023
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:39,919
accept when you shouldn't

1024
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,600
and i know that's really confusing but

1025
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,799
let's figure out when you should and

1026
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,440
shouldn't negotiate

1027
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,200
oh come on slides don't fail me now

1028
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,720
sorry tech problems all right so you

1029
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,760
negotiate when

1030
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,760
you have a written offer um i've talked

1031
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,760
to a lot of my friends in hr

1032
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,640
who see so many candidates below it by

1033
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,919
starting before they've even done the

1034
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,360
interview and saying well i need to make

1035
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,120
one million dollars or don't even bother

1036
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,840
with me

1037
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,799
most of the time they're not going to

1038
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,240
bother with you because you haven't

1039
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,000
actually demonstrated your value

1040
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,840
don't negotiate until they've given you

1041
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,919
an offer because you are not then in a

1042
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,120
more powerful position

1043
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,279
to start moving that compensation

1044
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,720
package up or down

1045
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,240
um they are probably going to give you

1046
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,480
their middle best offer most of the time

1047
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,960
and that way you can figure out if their

1048
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,559
pay range is anywhere close if you're

1049
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,080
making a hundred thousand and they offer

1050
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,120
you 50

1051
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,399
you guys probably are never gonna

1052
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,640
actually meet where it is acceptable for

1053
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,240
you it's just not gonna happen

1054
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,399
if they give you an offer that's okayish

1055
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:39,840
but has room like if they could give you

1056
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,640
just 10

1057
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,240
more then you can figure out if it's

1058
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,919
worth negotiating

1059
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,760
um figure out if you can provide more

1060
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,480
value um here's something that a lot of

1061
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,320
folks don't always see um being a urm

1062
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,880
in and of itself provides value because

1063
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,559
when you're on an engineering team when

1064
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,080
you're on a product team

1065
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,480
having non-homogenized views builds

1066
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,760
better products

1067
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,679
by definition of the fact that you are a

1068
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,919
urm you are providing value your

1069
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:06,720
experience

1070
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,760
matters um figure out how you're a

1071
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,760
unique candidate um one of my sort of

1072
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,440
superpowers is that

1073
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,199
i because i run a conference i know a

1074
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,639
lot of people so

1075
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,639
that sounds silly right okay so she

1076
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,679
knows a lot of people

1077
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,440
well that means that when i run into a

1078
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,359
problem and i need to call somebody

1079
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,440
at a company i probably know somebody

1080
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,679
there if we need to form a partnership

1081
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,280
i i don't have to go through the you

1082
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,359
know the sales calls and the

1083
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,040
17 people to get there i can just pick

1084
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,399
up the phone because i probably already

1085
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:35,359
know somebody

1086
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,520
figure out what your superpowers are and

1087
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,520
be able to articulate those to future

1088
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,359
employers

1089
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,960
all right statistically and historically

1090
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,440
women

1091
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,119
don't negotiate their pay um

1092
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,879
i've been told that it's better to

1093
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,639
negotiate as if you know it's your best

1094
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,560
friend or a close relative

1095
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,719
i actually negotiate uh on behalf of

1096
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,760
women everywhere

1097
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,800
i have negotiated every single offer um

1098
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,800
in the last probably 10 years once i

1099
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,400
read that women don't negotiate now it's

1100
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,680
like this weird pride thing with me

1101
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,720
where i'm like well i'm not going to be

1102
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,160
one of the women who don't negotiate i'm

1103
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,599
totally negotiating

1104
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,560
um my most recent uh job they came in

1105
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,400
actually really at the top end of their

1106
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,000
salary band and i knew it was a great

1107
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,520
offer and it was way more than i was

1108
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,920
making um and i still negotiated because

1109
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,200
i thought i'm not going to be one of

1110
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,720
those women who doesn't ask for more

1111
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,440
money

1112
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,720
so uh i ended up i think getting i was

1113
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,440
like it's

1114
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,800
two thousand dollars more something

1115
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,880
ridiculous but i still asked and i still

1116
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,000
you know it was still something that

1117
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,440
they were able to do

1118
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,280
um know what your fold line is and what

1119
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,720
do i mean by that

1120
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,920
um i had a job offer with a company that

1121
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,000
i loved i thought i would be so good at

1122
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,640
it i loved the team the job was great

1123
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,960
but they were offering me 10 000 less

1124
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,560
than what i was making at my current job

1125
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,160
and i just couldn't do it

1126
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,320
and i knew that and so i walked away um

1127
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,440
i just said you know thanks

1128
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,160
thanks but i can't do this so i uh they

1129
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,040
called me back

1130
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,400
after two weeks and said okay just

1131
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,000
kidding we're gonna raise it and pay you

1132
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,440
ten thousand dollars more than

1133
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,480
what you're actually making at your

1134
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,960
current job if i had taken that job at

1135
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,160
that pay i would have been

1136
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,000
miserable because i would have felt

1137
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,560
undervalued don't go into a job

1138
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,800
thinking that you know it's okay that

1139
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,160
they're not paying me what i'm worth

1140
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,040
because it will

1141
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,760
gnaw at you and you will be unhappy um

1142
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,359
if you can't get them on salaries

1143
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:20,880
ask for things like vacation days

1144
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,960
flexible work schedule commuter benefits

1145
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,480
see if there's any way they can make up

1146
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,599
that difference

1147
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,119
in a way that's meaningful to you

1148
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,359
all right key takeaways i know we've

1149
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,359
covered an awful lot

1150
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,520
understand different comp structures

1151
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,160
figure out your risk and reward schedule

1152
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,320
do your research on years of experience

1153
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,599
your pay levels

1154
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,280
um etc always always negotiate

1155
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,560
but wait till you have a written offer

1156
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,040
to do so

1157
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,640
um so here's the resources uh i just

1158
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,760
just set up my my website

1159
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,440
it's got like two things on it but

1160
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,040
people keep asking me for my slides and

1161
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,720
i always send them to like dropbox and

1162
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,560
drive and wherever my internet

1163
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,320
host is of the day so i just put them

1164
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,800
all on this uh we laugh because i just

1165
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,720
started a job in internet of things so

1166
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,400
this is the internet of tracy

1167
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,839
uh so yeah uh that is pretty much

1168
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:17,040
it i actually just realized that i am

1169
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,359
not in the stage where i can see your

1170
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:20,400
questions

1171
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,200
so give me like two seconds and i will

1172
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,440
pop over there and i will be around for

1173
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,119
questions for the next

1174
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,920
10 minutes or so yeah i can read them

1175
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,320
okay

1176
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,599
i'm here oh yep all right

1177
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,440
so the first question we got i'm just

1178
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,960
going to read them verbatim because

1179
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,960
every time i try to change

1180
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,640
pronouns and stuff it it gets really

1181
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,720
weird so it's not my question but you'll

1182
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,040
hear

1183
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,240
i um question okay a lot of people i

1184
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,079
know are breaking into infosec

1185
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,160
and trying to get their first job may or

1186
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,920
may not have a degree

1187
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,400
or they work jobs that don't offer stock

1188
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,680
or six for your salary

1189
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,320
so that's the premise um do you have

1190
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,560
recommendations for how to make a large

1191
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,480
jump from a five figure salary

1192
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,520
to something paying in the mid 100s with

1193
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,720
stock and additional benefits

1194
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,640
yes but you may not like this answer so

1195
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,640
i too did not have a degree

1196
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,119
when i came into infosec um and quite

1197
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:15,760
frankly

1198
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,320
if i'm being honest my degree now is not

1199
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,240
really worth the paper it's written on

1200
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,599
um but if look they were involved in a

1201
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:24,960
lawsuit it's a whole long thing you can

1202
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,000
look it up

1203
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,119
it's fine um so what i did is i

1204
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,280
put a five-year plan in and i knew that

1205
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,520
i was doing server admin at first it was

1206
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:33,839
my

1207
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,119
i was doing patches it was like the

1208
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,119
lowest level infosec job that i could

1209
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:37,520
get

1210
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,960
the pay was terrible the hours were

1211
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,560
terrible the manager was terrible

1212
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,839
but i spent a lot of time and i figured

1213
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,359
out a certification path and for me that

1214
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,359
worked i got a plus and net plus and

1215
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,960
security plus and every

1216
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,839
year or two years i would go and

1217
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,839
interview for a job that was wildly

1218
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,760
beyond my qualifications

1219
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,680
and even if i didn't get it i started to

1220
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,000
learn what questions they were asking um

1221
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,680
the cool thing now is you can go on

1222
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,680
sites like blind you can go on stock

1223
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,200
sites like levels you can go on

1224
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,040
glassdoor or elite code there's a bunch

1225
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,920
of other ones

1226
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,520
and you can start seeing what interview

1227
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,880
questions they're asking and start

1228
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,240
preparing yourself

1229
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,839
so a lot of this information is much

1230
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,359
more democratized than it was

1231
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,119
when i was coming up and i know i sound

1232
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,640
like methuselah but

1233
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,440
um that's that's how i would do it if i

1234
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,960
were trying to make that significant

1235
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,160
jump

1236
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,160
don't get you're much more likely to get

1237
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,320
more pay unfortunately if you

1238
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,160
go to a new company and that's a

1239
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,440
terrible thing and i wish that wasn't

1240
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,119
the state of our industry but that is

1241
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,560
unfortunately the state of our industry

1242
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,320
today

1243
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,119
okay yes yes it is all right cool so the

1244
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,839
next question

1245
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:42,960
is

1246
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,040
pay gaps between men and women

1247
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,480
unfortunately exist

1248
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,800
but for black women or women of color

1249
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,839
specifically

1250
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,400
there's even more of a gap aside from

1251
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,000
all the awesome advice you gave

1252
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,079
what else could black women or women of

1253
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,960
color do to negotiate for a salary

1254
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,960
that at least meets the minimum that

1255
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,079
their white female

1256
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,200
counterparts make

1257
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,280
so that's a great question and i will

1258
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,359
just be completely honest and say that

1259
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,520
not being a person of color i feel like

1260
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,640
i don't have

1261
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,079
a ton of great experience to offer um

1262
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,520
for me i think it is in the power of

1263
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,760
networking and asking around and

1264
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,800
unfortunately

1265
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,400
for me it's

1266
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,960
as a white woman i know that i'm making

1267
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,640
less than my male counterparts it's not

1268
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,920
fair and it's not right

1269
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,319
and i fight against it every single day

1270
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:37,040
um i haven't found a way to make that go

1271
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,599
away

1272
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,760
um i will say joining things like blacks

1273
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,800
and cyber

1274
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,680
joining um things like and i hate to

1275
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,359
sound like a shill but defendcon where

1276
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,040
we have career villages and we have

1277
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,319
resume workshops

1278
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:49,680
and being able to really leverage your

1279
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,920
network i think for all urms is

1280
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,440
incredibly important

1281
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,440
i think it is the number one thing we

1282
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,720
can do to

1283
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,079
dismantle the pay gap like

1284
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,240
i just want to comment just because i've

1285
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,119
done

1286
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,400
also negotiations um ask your white male

1287
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,079
colleagues who are doing the exact same

1288
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,680
job you are doing with the exact same

1289
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,920
credentials or as close as you can get

1290
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,839
and then be prepared for your jaw to

1291
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,920
drop but that gives you a sense of what

1292
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,040
they're earning

1293
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,319
so i think you're in an even better

1294
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,640
position to negotiate when you know what

1295
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,480
what people are paying right don't be

1296
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,760
afraid to ask them

1297
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,160
i i'm always shocked at how people just

1298
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,200
tell you like

1299
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,040
if they're if they know you that they

1300
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,400
will tell you they want to they want to

1301
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,000
help you they're your ally

1302
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,720
like take advantage of it um so i think

1303
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,960
it's one of those times

1304
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,560
yeah and sites like blind can actually

1305
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,000
give you a really good idea

1306
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,200
um for total compensation as well um

1307
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,000
but also understand that especially as

1308
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,319
women and as minorities we are not

1309
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,560
always i have not always been in a

1310
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,319
position where i could hold out to the

1311
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,000
last cent because

1312
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,680
i had bills to pay and i had to make a

1313
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,599
paycheck even if i knew it wasn't a fair

1314
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:58,640
paycheck and i

1315
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,240
don't love that and i think we should

1316
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,000
continue fighting every day to make

1317
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,640
it not like that but i do also respect

1318
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,160
and understand that because of my

1319
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:06,720
privilege

1320
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,000
i have not had to um

1321
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,920
walk those shoes i don't necessarily

1322
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,760
have that experience

1323
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,520
totally um all right so the next

1324
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,520
question is can you speak to how much

1325
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,359
these numbers might change if someone

1326
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,359
doesn't live in a tech hub

1327
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,040
can they have similar expectations for

1328
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,359
compensation

1329
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,280
oh you've chosen an interesting year to

1330
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,280
ask that question

1331
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,079
um i'll give you my pre-covet answer in

1332
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,319
my post-covet answer

1333
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,480
i would say yes you would definitely

1334
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,240
have a significant decrease in

1335
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,520
compensation

1336
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,400
um cost of living is lower you know

1337
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,560
prices is lower labor market is lower

1338
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,240
i have found that unless you're in a

1339
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,760
tech hub unfortunately you're just not

1340
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,800
going to see

1341
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,119
those salaries but i will also say that

1342
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,720
having lived in alabama

1343
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,000
my house there was 230 000 for a four

1344
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,880
bedroom house

1345
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,520
and uh it is definitely not that in

1346
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,400
seattle

1347
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,680
um so yes i get paid way more than i did

1348
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,599
in alabama but i also spend an

1349
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,560
awful lot more postcovid i think we're

1350
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,920
gonna start to see an inversion in the

1351
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,960
labor market

1352
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,200
as people realize that yes we can do

1353
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,560
remote work because

1354
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,920
we are um and as talent starts to flee

1355
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,280
hubs like the bay area

1356
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,839
and seattle and austin i think you're

1357
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,040
going to see

1358
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,880
pay level i think you're going to see

1359
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,079
those compensations

1360
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,040
start to level out because if i can get

1361
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:29,599
a

1362
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,240
software engineer in tulsa to do the job

1363
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,079
for half the pay then why wouldn't i as

1364
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,000
a business

1365
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,880
so that answers the question i'm trying

1366
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,240
to scroll through so hopefully if the

1367
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,680
person didn't like the answer they'll

1368
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,880
they'll ask a new one

1369
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,160
um so how do you approach negotiating

1370
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,839
telecommuting for a position

1371
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,240
ah okay yeah it's only honestly my

1372
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,640
again i feel like i'm like 700 years old

1373
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,079
so um

1374
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,400
i think i finally got to a place where

1375
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,520
uh so

1376
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,599
full disclosure with the last company i

1377
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,720
was with uh

1378
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,319
they were in seattle i actually live

1379
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:07,599
outside of seattle it's about an hour

1380
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:08,720
and a half commute

1381
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,240
and they approached the recruiter

1382
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,599
approached me and i said look i said i

1383
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:13,119
don't do jobs in seattle like

1384
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:15,280
full stop no not happening she's like

1385
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,200
well just talk to the team and then

1386
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,200
you know everything's negotiable and so

1387
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,800
i started my very first talk with the

1388
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,240
hiring manager and said i'm not driving

1389
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,079
to seattle i'll come in two days a week

1390
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,440
take it or leave it um i can do that

1391
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,440
because i'm at a level in my career

1392
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,359
where i'm very fortunate to have

1393
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,720
different job offers

1394
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:37,280
not everyone has that option

1395
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,200
oh dear it looks like we just lost

1396
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,599
our speaker i'm sorry that was my

1397
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,000
mistake um i was attempting to hide

1398
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,400
the speaker's desktop okay uh

1399
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,000
hang tight everybody when we try to get

1400
00:44:52,000 --> 00:45:05,839
tracy back

1401
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:26,000
and it looks like there's a lot of great

1402
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,160
conversations going on in chat while we

1403
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,160
kind of hang tight for a minute

1404
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,640
um just gonna scroll through and make

1405
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,240
sure i didn't miss

1406
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,240
anything uh there's some yeah there's

1407
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,280
some really great questions

1408
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,960
hopefully we can get tracy back because

1409
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,920
i don't feel like i'm the expert

1410
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,839
to answer these um

1411
00:45:50,240 --> 00:46:00,319
but keep chatting amongst yourselves

1412
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:02,319
you're back yay okay we were talking

1413
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:03,920
about how to negotiate

1414
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,800
uh telecommuting so maybe you can start

1415
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,720
from there again

1416
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:15,839
okay hold on

1417
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,640
okay so we can't hear you if you can

1418
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,359
hear me no okay no sorry i had that old

1419
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,280
link was open in the background and oh

1420
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,240
no

1421
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,599
but you couldn't hear me and then it was

1422
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,520
this crazy echo situation happening

1423
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,640
sorry i'm back

1424
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,880
um what was our last question i've

1425
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:37,920
totally it's about

1426
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,440
telling commuting how to negotiate

1427
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,160
telecom which you have experience with

1428
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,119
i do actually uh this uh well i mean

1429
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,760
don't all of us now with cobid but um

1430
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,359
so my answer's not great in that i

1431
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:52,720
understand that because

1432
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,800
um i've just been around a while and i

1433
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,079
i've been very fortunate

1434
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:57,760
in job offers i was able to say take it

1435
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,119
or leave it but

1436
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:00,800
if you don't have that flexibility i

1437
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,240
would say look for companies that are

1438
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,920
intrinsically remote friendly

1439
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,440
companies like twitter for example have

1440
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,599
gone 100 remote option if you're

1441
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,160
if you want to um other companies have a

1442
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,920
culture of butts and seats

1443
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,640
um understand that before you go in um

1444
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,920
don't think you're going to change the

1445
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,359
company culture

1446
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:20,160
because best case scenario you negotiate

1447
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,280
remote and you get

1448
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,920
shut out of a culture that is focused on

1449
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,760
being butts and seats and it's harder to

1450
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,400
get promoted and it's harder to

1451
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,640
interject with the team um so i guess

1452
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,200
that's the best answer

1453
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,559
the next question is kind of interesting

1454
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,319
and so the the question is how do you

1455
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:39,520
breach the negotiation conversation

1456
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,839
so i i'm not sure i understand it

1457
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:43,119
completely but maybe that means

1458
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:43,760
something

1459
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,839
to you i think it's like how do you get

1460
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,920
going with the negotiations yeah i think

1461
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,319
you take it and then say thanks but no

1462
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,480
thanks i want more money

1463
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,319
i think that's what that i think that's

1464
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:55,280
what that's the question i'm going to

1465
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,400
answer if it's not then okay

1466
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,040
let's go for it i'll check the chat in

1467
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,160
case that's not the

1468
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,359
right answer um so i would say assuming

1469
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,200
you have a written offer in hand

1470
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,599
um actually let's go back let's go back

1471
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:08,240
before that

1472
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,440
so they're going to ask you what do you

1473
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,359
want to get paid and i hope that you're

1474
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:12,319
going to say

1475
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:14,000
tell me what the salary range is for

1476
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,839
this position and then figure out based

1477
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,200
on your skills and experience where you

1478
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,400
land in that range

1479
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,319
let them name a number first if you can

1480
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:22,079
i am legitimately awful at this

1481
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:23,760
but do let them name a number first

1482
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,200
because you never know

1483
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,280
um what they're actually able to pay you

1484
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,960
unless you let them name

1485
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,400
an offer first um when you get the offer

1486
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,359
if it's not what you expected or it

1487
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:36,720
doesn't work for you or if you're just

1488
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,000
trying to ask and see if they have any

1489
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,040
more room

1490
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,839
um i usually like to say you know i'm

1491
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,040
start off with the reasons you want the

1492
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:43,760
job i

1493
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,079
am so excited to come work for x company

1494
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,440
i think my skills

1495
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,200
are really good match i really think i

1496
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,280
can provide a lot of value to this team

1497
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,760
i want to be happy here long term and in

1498
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,800
order to do that

1499
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,079
i just feel like the compensation isn't

1500
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:58,880
quite

1501
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,040
where it needs to be to make this a

1502
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,480
viable offer for me

1503
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,480
so never say you're not paying me enough

1504
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,960
money or hey this offer sucks or

1505
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,760
any of those things um try to frame it

1506
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,640
in a positive

1507
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,240
frame it is i'm bringing your company

1508
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,720
value i want to make sure that you know

1509
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,640
we're both happy at the end of the day

1510
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,960
because a happy employee is a productive

1511
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,480
employee

1512
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,480
is that kind of on the right yeah

1513
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,760
okay well i i'm not getting any um

1514
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,520
oh okay so then there was sort of a

1515
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,040
follow-up which is interesting what do

1516
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:31,920
you say when a

1517
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,160
company asks for salary requirements on

1518
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:34,960
an application

1519
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,800
or phone screen um

1520
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,119
i usually put something crazy um because

1521
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,800
they're usually usually the form will

1522
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,520
ask you for a

1523
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,359
number an integer number so i'll put

1524
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:47,680
something crazy like one to five dollars

1525
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,720
um and then when the uh

1526
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,400
recruiter is like one to five dollars

1527
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,319
that's obscene i will remind them

1528
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:56,559
that a ask asking me to provide my at

1529
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:57,599
least the state of washington in

1530
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:58,319
california

1531
00:49:58,319 --> 00:49:59,760
asking me to provide salary history is

1532
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,520
no longer legal um

1533
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,079
and also i will say something like well

1534
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:04,800
i really

1535
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,640
you know i really want to take this job

1536
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,559
i understand that it's a unique position

1537
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:11,280
and my experience speaks for itself but

1538
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,200
i know that this position will be unique

1539
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,280
and i'm sure that you're going to pay

1540
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,960
according to the skill set that you're

1541
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,640
looking for something that lets them

1542
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,480
know hey i understand why you're asking

1543
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,359
this question

1544
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:22,640
but no i'm not going to give you my

1545
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,880
salary report or my salary requirements

1546
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,400
or my salary history

1547
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,680
yeah i i won't do it either so i'm down

1548
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,359
with that answer

1549
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:33,520
um how do you negotiate when making a

1550
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,760
pivot or a career change

1551
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,240
i.e you have significant work experience

1552
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,440
but not in cyber

1553
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,640
are you starting from scratch

1554
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:47,280
oh this is a hard one um

1555
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,839
there's not a good answer for this um

1556
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:51,119
you're not starting from scratch you

1557
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:52,559
definitely bring life skills

1558
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:55,760
and um experience to the table

1559
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,240
however if you are trying to make a

1560
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,000
career change understand that you may

1561
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,240
have to go back to go forwards um i did

1562
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:02,559
this

1563
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,160
a little bit um when i came

1564
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,520
into tech um i made significantly more

1565
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,880
but i didn't make as much as somebody

1566
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,800
who had been doing tech for a long time

1567
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,160
part of it to be quite honest my own

1568
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,000
ignorance and part of it because i was

1569
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,240
literally entering a new field that

1570
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,319
bore very little resemblance to my

1571
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:22,559
previous field um

1572
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,480
figure out if this job is going to get

1573
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,079
you to the salary you want to be in five

1574
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,920
years and what i mean by that is is this

1575
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,680
just a placeholder job if it is then

1576
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,680
it's probably not worth taking a pay cut

1577
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,599
is this a job that in a year you can say

1578
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,200
okay now i have red team experience or

1579
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,160
blue team experience

1580
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,960
and then i can go get a sock analyst two

1581
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,559
position or three that's gonna get me

1582
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:41,680
closer to my

1583
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,920
actual to pay target uh i know that's

1584
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,760
kind of a fuzzy answer but it it really

1585
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,440
does depend on kind of what your five

1586
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,920
five year plan is yeah no i think that

1587
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,359
makes sense i think it's smart to look

1588
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:52,880
out i don't think a lot of us

1589
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,880
plan that far out in advance i mean i

1590
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,640
know i don't but i like it

1591
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,400
honestly i don't plan like more than 20

1592
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,319
minutes into my future or i have plans

1593
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:01,599
and then they just all fall apart so i

1594
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:03,119
just fell apart

1595
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,640
all right so this is an interesting

1596
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,880
question um any advice for negotiating

1597
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:07,200
with

1598
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,000
big companies big all in caps they

1599
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:10,960
usually feel like

1600
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,119
here's your offer take it or leave it or

1601
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:14,480
that

1602
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,880
for example flex work isn't a policy

1603
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,800
they can control so like with a big

1604
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,839
company

1605
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,359
like they have all the policies and all

1606
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:23,359
the things and take it or leave it yeah

1607
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:25,040
what do you do

1608
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,640
so i will say it's much easier to

1609
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,079
negotiate with smaller companies

1610
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,319
um however um

1611
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,319
a certain tech company that rhymes with

1612
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:36,800
schmugel um when we were in

1613
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,200
salary negotiations they said look our

1614
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,960
our pay is equity heavy that's just how

1615
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,160
it is

1616
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,920
that's you know it's beyond my my

1617
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,359
control you know i i

1618
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:46,960
am you know controlled by the great

1619
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,400
overlords that run the company

1620
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,400
and that's you know that's just the way

1621
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,000
it is i said well

1622
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,680
thank you very much but that's just not

1623
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,839
gonna work for me um

1624
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,920
that was my fold line so you have to

1625
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,599
know is it worth it to get that name on

1626
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:01,200
your resume because that is worth

1627
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:01,680
something

1628
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,440
being able to say you worked at you know

1629
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,040
xyz big company

1630
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,119
is worth something how much is that

1631
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:08,640
worth to you are you starting out in

1632
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:09,680
your career are you

1633
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,160
senior in your career i'm in a point now

1634
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:12,800
where

1635
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,440
you know if god himself offered me a job

1636
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,359
i'd be like well let's talk terms

1637
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:19,520
you know because i i'm at a point where

1638
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,599
i'm really picky about the jobs i i

1639
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:24,880
take and i want us both to be happy

1640
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,559
i like it and um so the last questions

1641
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:31,680
before we get kicked off the stage is

1642
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,079
at what stage of the hiring process are

1643
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:34,720
the hr

1644
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,160
questions that you discussed in the

1645
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,760
beginning appropriate

1646
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,839
to ask they're not necessarily

1647
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:42,400
negotiating

1648
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,839
and now i don't know what questions were

1649
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:45,680
at the beginning so hopefully questions

1650
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,160
about like stock stock equity rsu's

1651
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,040
versus stock options investors

1652
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,240
um i will say the answer is twofold one

1653
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,079
um do as much research as you can on

1654
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:57,440
your own because you don't want to be

1655
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,440
the person that pesters the hr rep to

1656
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,640
death and then they hate you

1657
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,800
um because that that's just never that's

1658
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,839
no good for anyone

1659
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:05,839
most of this stuff you can find um

1660
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:07,280
online you can find

1661
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,200
either on the company's website or on

1662
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,960
things like levels.fyi

1663
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,280
um if you go to levels.fyi you can

1664
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,280
compare say microsoft and amazon and you

1665
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,480
can see

1666
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,119
um like their vesting schedule and um

1667
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:20,640
you can look at different offers and see

1668
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,520
how much their bonuses and you can

1669
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,200
google a lot of this for yourself if you

1670
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,599
absolutely cannot find the answer

1671
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,400
then the appropriate time to ask it is

1672
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,119
um

1673
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:32,559
right after they give you the written

1674
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:34,400
offer um

1675
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,680
basically until you have a piece of

1676
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,040
paper in your hand you have no

1677
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,440
negotiating credentials whatsoever so i

1678
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,480
would recommend

1679
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,960
taking the offer asking questions back

1680
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,480
and forth and then doing a total comp

1681
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,680
analysis for yourself

1682
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,119
those graphs that i made you can go and

1683
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:49,200
make on levels.fyi and you can compare

1684
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,200
offers yourself and that'll give you

1685
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,440
kind of an overview of how much you're

1686
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,680
actually going to make in four years

1687
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,440
