00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,880
uh yes this is low tech and insecure

35
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,479
just to be very clear this is

36
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,280
not a technical talk this is not your

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,600
entry-level physical penetration

38
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,640
talk this is not an hr talk either and

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,799
it's not even a soft skills talk

40
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,360
this is a life skills talk and it's

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:33,840
about

42
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,920
building uh confidence through

43
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,680
boundaries

44
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,799
i am carlata sage i have worked at a lot

45
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,159
of silicon valley

46
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,520
uh tech companies i have

47
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,840
when i've gone to a lot of different

48
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,840
colleges and universities

49
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,479
uh and i want to to give a little aside

50
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,000
to our hiring managers

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
out there and remind them that the

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,240
carlitos age that dropped out

53
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,399
of auburn university had the exact same

54
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,280
potential

55
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,520
as the carlotta sage that graduated from

56
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,840
columbia university with her masters

57
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,840
i just didn't have the experience or the

58
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,679
guidance to know what i wanted so

59
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,160
hiring managers please don't let the

60
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,760
lack of a degree

61
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,599
keep you from hiring a really fantastic

62
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,440
person i've been very lucky in my career

63
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,720
in that regard

64
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,000
but enough about me i want to talk about

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,720
confidence what is your confidence level

66
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,239
and the reason i ask this question

67
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,959
is that over the last 10 years i've had

68
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:29,760
a lot of

69
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,319
younger women and men come up to me and

70
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,200
asked me to be

71
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,599
their mentor and at first i was a little

72
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,800
horrified

73
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,040
because i am not historically someone

74
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,040
that i would have gone to for mentoring

75
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,120
uh but as i asked them what is it that

76
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,800
you're looking for that you feel like

77
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,000
carlota can

78
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,519
teach you a lot of what came back was

79
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,319
i i just you're so confident and i i

80
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,120
just feel like i

81
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,040
i'm an imposter all the time there was a

82
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,760
lot of talk around imposter syndrome

83
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,920
i do not personally suffer from imposter

84
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,319
syndrome so i cannot guarantee

85
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,800
that the talk that i give you is gonna

86
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,599
going to help you

87
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,519
understand or resolve your imposter

88
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,920
syndrome but what i can tell you is that

89
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,760
my confidence comes from knowing my

90
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,400
boundaries

91
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,680
really really well uh we don't all as

92
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,480
human beings

93
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,560
start out on the right side of this

94
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,640
image that very confident

95
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,440
you know ready to face the world i tend

96
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:23,920
to be

97
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,760
on that right side maybe between those

98
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,280
two right hand figures

99
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,040
sometimes the world pushes me down to

100
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,200
the left sometimes you know

101
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,840
i need a extra hand to help me get back

102
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,200
to the right

103
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,120
most of us are somewhere in between

104
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,400
hopefully

105
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,480
you are not on the left but what i want

106
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,799
to to help you understand

107
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,519
is that building your confidence is

108
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,000
something that

109
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,040
you can do and you may have to engage

110
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,879
a mental health professional a career

111
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,640
coach a life coach

112
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,680
but you you need to take ownership of

113
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,480
that if you feel like you're an impostor

114
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,959
don't feel that way you've got to find a

115
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,959
way past that and you can learn that

116
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:03,680
piece

117
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,519
so what i'm going to give you today is

118
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,120
carlita's crash course

119
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,959
on finding your boundaries so that you

120
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,480
can start to understand

121
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,959
where you are on this image and where

122
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,480
you want to be

123
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,560
and how to maybe start practicing some

124
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,000
of those pieces that will build your

125
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,639
confidence

126
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,479
uh i'm going to start with physical

127
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,000
boundaries because those are some

128
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,199
very obvious very common

129
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,560
uh especially egregious places to

130
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,759
push on people's boundaries and has

131
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,600
many people in this audience know both

132
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,120
female and male and other

133
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,320
identifying uh non-binary folks

134
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,280
um the physical boundaries are so

135
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,400
important

136
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,600
and sometimes that you

137
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
you get that hand on your knee you get

138
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,160
that hand in a strange place you're not

139
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,680
comfortable but you're not necessarily

140
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,440
comfortable saying something

141
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,080
i want you to start practicing where

142
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,040
your boundaries are

143
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,560
physically and i want you to start

144
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,160
practicing defending them

145
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,400
because it's very important people who

146
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,600
push on your boundaries

147
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,759
especially abusers are going to start

148
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,120
very small

149
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,120
and you have to defend those small

150
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,400
boundaries so that

151
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,000
by the time that they're trying to push

152
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,520
on those bigger boundaries

153
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,240
uh you've got those defenses built up so

154
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,520
if you find that hand

155
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,680
on your knee or sliding down your skirt

156
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,960
or up your leg

157
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,039
you need to be very clear and you don't

158
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,639
have to be angry about it i used to be

159
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,560
very angry about it i'm very much more

160
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,720
uh just simply certain about it now

161
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,880
but you need to be very clear remove

162
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,320
your hand from my body

163
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,880
you do not have consent to touch me it's

164
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,840
very simple

165
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,400
and i talk about this because especially

166
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,680
at conferences

167
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,080
uh we get a little loose we get a little

168
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,160
we get to cut up we get people who are

169
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,240
of our mindset we get our tribe we get a

170
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,680
little alcohol in us

171
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,840
um and we may we may also push on those

172
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,039
boundaries so i

173
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,680
i put this image up so that people can

174
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,000
understand and have kind of a level set

175
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,560
that this

176
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,680
is not okay and they can point back and

177
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,319
say you know

178
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,680
carlotta said it's not okay it's a

179
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,639
really basic thing and when it comes to

180
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,560
defending your physical boundaries don't

181
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,240
be shy about that it is not a request

182
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,560
you do not have to say please this is

183
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,080
your space

184
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,880
remove your hand from my body and it's

185
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,639
very simple

186
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,400
next i'm going to talk a little bit

187
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,280
about verbal boundaries

188
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,039
and this is a much more difficult space

189
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,080
to talk about because

190
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,840
words can literally kill we hear stories

191
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,360
see stories all the time

192
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,639
about cyberbullying cyberstalking

193
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,680
and people literally beating other

194
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,400
people down

195
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,919
with words and telling them that they're

196
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,759
worthless telling them that they should

197
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,400
die

198
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,000
it is not okay um even in the workplace

199
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,280
even if we're not going to that extreme

200
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,919
choose your words well choose your words

201
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,000
thoughtfully because

202
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,039
the words that you choose build people's

203
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,319
confidence in you

204
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,319
they build your own confidence as well

205
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,440
but they also build

206
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,000
the people's confidence in you they

207
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,479
build

208
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,440
your credibility they build your ability

209
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,240
to work

210
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,280
in very difficult situations i'm very

211
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,120
good with collaboration i've made a lot

212
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,000
of my career

213
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,800
around getting technical teams who are

214
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,039
antagonistic to work together

215
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,520
um and part of that is the word

216
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,800
selection

217
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,199
uh i will give you a very personal

218
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:33,840
example

219
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,479
from my own life my own career i worked

220
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,199
for

221
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,759
a heavily asian company and i had an

222
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,479
older

223
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,479
gentleman for a boss an older gentleman

224
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,520
from hong kong

225
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,520
and he would call me girl and that did

226
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,800
not bother me because

227
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,680
i knew that he was not saying it in any

228
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,599
malicious kind of way that was just

229
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,960
the era he came from um but

230
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,639
the younger men started picking it up

231
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,000
and the way they said it was

232
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,120
not okay they would say it very

233
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,319
derisively very kind of viciously uh

234
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,520
so the next time the boss called me girl

235
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,479
and in front of the rest of the team i i

236
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,160
called him on it and i very gently

237
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,280
well not very gently very uh assertively

238
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,240
said

239
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,800
you may call me woman or you may call me

240
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,919
the b word

241
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,520
but you are not allowed to call me girl

242
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,440
anymore and

243
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,759
when he kind of paused i said i want you

244
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,000
to say in your native language

245
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,840
uh which i believe was either mandarin

246
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,280
or cantonese i'm not sure because he

247
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,120
came from hong kong

248
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,559
uh i want you to say what you just said

249
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,320
to me and i want you to use girl in your

250
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,799
language and he said it out loud and

251
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,080
the look on his face of just

252
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,200
regret he said oh crolitta i'm so very

253
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,000
sorry

254
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,600
i will never call you girl again so

255
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,080
it matters it matters how people in the

256
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,880
workplace

257
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,839
refer to you and it's okay to push back

258
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:56,640
on that

259
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,880
and it's okay sometimes with sunglasses

260
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,480
but that boss for certain

261
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,640
um it's okay to push back on on them in

262
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,839
front of other people

263
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,560
especially if you can give them you know

264
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,240
that empathy if you know that you can

265
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,880
get them

266
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,160
to come to an empathetic place with you

267
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,160
uh i hope that you will still make

268
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,440
room for people for whom english is not

269
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,800
their first language

270
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,560
i make a lot of room for older

271
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,920
generations because

272
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,080
uh generations older than me did not

273
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,279
have the internet

274
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,800
we are much more aware and the

275
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
generations that came after me are

276
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,560
incredibly aware uh i i know there's a

277
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,519
lot of discussion

278
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,640
on do we have to change safe whitelist

279
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,560
blacklist to safelist except

280
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,240
for example language has always evolved

281
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,640
and it evolves without us so the fact

282
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,240
that we're taking some ownership of that

283
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,120
evolution

284
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,320
i see is a very good thing

285
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,399
in terms of boundaries though

286
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,640
you have to work that one out this one

287
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,680
is a little

288
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,040
softer a little harder to to define

289
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,480
you definitely want to talk to your

290
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,279
peers and get their feedback

291
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,120
listen to the people you trust if they

292
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,279
say no it's not okay for them to talk to

293
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,360
you that way

294
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,440
figure out where your confidence level

295
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,680
is and confronting that

296
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,959
that's a very tough boundary sometimes

297
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,720
to defend

298
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,399
but unfortunately i don't have a lot of

299
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,240
time to keep going into that

300
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,320
the next boundary that i want to cover

301
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,160
though are your emotional boundaries and

302
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,720
these are

303
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,839
by far and away the the most difficult

304
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,320
um you think words are tough emotions

305
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,839
are very tough

306
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,680
the thing i want you to remember about

307
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,079
emotions when you have that

308
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,560
emotional response to a situation or to

309
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,720
something someone has said to you

310
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,200
you need to understand that that is your

311
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,079
emotion

312
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,160
and it is not right or wrong it doesn't

313
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,760
matter if the other person

314
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,000
understands it or agrees with it or

315
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,200
finds that emotion

316
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,920
reasonable you need to own that this is

317
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,120
how i feel about this

318
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,120
i'm afraid of dogs that is the way i

319
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,279
feel about that bringing me a dog is not

320
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,480
going to make me feel better

321
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,720
right um that's just one example

322
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,240
the other person though needs to

323
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,800
understand that they cannot

324
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,279
fix that emotional response and they

325
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,240
cannot bend

326
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,200
that emotional response to me be more

327
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,000
favorable

328
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,120
for them you need to own this is how i

329
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,800
feel about this

330
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,880
you need to ask for more time and it

331
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,000
could be that

332
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,040
you do have some very tight emotional

333
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,800
boundaries there that need to be maybe a

334
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,480
little more flexible

335
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,240
the other thing about emotional and

336
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,760
really all boundaries

337
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,079
is that they are flexible they are

338
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,839
flexible for certain people or for

339
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,279
certain situations

340
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,959
you're going to be more comfortable or

341
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,560
less comfortable with your family

342
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,079
depending on how you grew up

343
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,079
you're going to be more comfortable with

344
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,839
your friends than with strangers

345
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,240
um the biggest thing is that you own

346
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,040
that

347
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,760
and then you think about if if somebody

348
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,200
you really trust

349
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,920
is surprised by your emotional boundary

350
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,600
then then maybe there's a discussion

351
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,279
there that you need to understand

352
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,079
where that feeling is coming from and

353
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:12,480
then

354
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,800
resolve that conflict because if it's

355
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,399
someone you really trust

356
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,680
you really want their input the problem

357
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,880
of course is

358
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,519
if you really trust an abusive person

359
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,440
that's also an issue that can

360
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,760
really really mess with your emotional

361
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,560
boundaries

362
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,000
but we're going to get to that in just a

363
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,160
little bit uh

364
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,079
the the biggest topic that i want to

365
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,720
talk about are the more sensitive things

366
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,720
intimacy romance sex in the workplace

367
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,560
and in industry conferences

368
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,079
we spend a lot of time with the people

369
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:48,880
we work with

370
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,880
and in security especially sometimes

371
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,000
that's a

372
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,360
crucible and that pressure

373
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,360
can actually forge a very close

374
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,639
relationship

375
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,120
uh if you are interested if you feel

376
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,120
like there is something beyond

377
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,639
a work relationship there you need to be

378
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,839
very careful about how you approach that

379
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,680
the simplest thing to do is to say

380
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,959
don't if you are

381
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,240
interested in a co-worker or in a

382
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,480
an industry peer if you feel like that

383
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,240
spark is there

384
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,959
be very careful be very careful about

385
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,800
revealing that because it will change

386
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,760
the dynamic of your relationship

387
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,440
but the reality is we're human

388
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,360
and we're not mannequins and we do have

389
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,600
those feelings and sometimes

390
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,079
we trust the other person enough and and

391
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,920
you really want to think about if you

392
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,240
trust that other person enough

393
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,000
maybe you trust that other person enough

394
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,360
to to see

395
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,680
if there is more available there and you

396
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,440
have to be very careful on how you

397
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,880
approach that

398
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,040
the best way is not to stick your hand

399
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,920
down their pants

400
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,160
it is not to suddenly lean over and kiss

401
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,199
them

402
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,440
some people respond positively to that

403
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,760
but it's not going to be very common

404
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,079
the best way to approach that is to ask

405
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,959
for consent and to say

406
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,360
i feel like there's something more here

407
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,120
is there the potential for that

408
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,160
am i is this a one-sided feeling and

409
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,399
you need to be very ready for rejection

410
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,680
for that

411
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,360
if you are the target of somebody else's

412
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,880
affection you need to be very

413
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,240
certain when you reject that person um

414
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,880
don't don't maybe them if it's a no it's

415
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,600
not

416
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,800
be very clear draw that boundary very

417
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,519
firmly

418
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,920
that there is not something more more

419
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,680
available here

420
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,320
if that changes now it's your turn to

421
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,000
ask consent uh

422
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,480
if you know how you you a few months ago

423
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,519
asked me

424
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,600
if there was more here and at the time i

425
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,920
said no but has i've gotten to know you

426
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,920
i think there could be more here are you

427
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,440
still interested

428
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,959
maybe they've met someone maybe they've

429
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,639
moved on

430
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,800
be very careful how you approach those

431
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,120
the easiest thing is always going to be

432
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,720
to hold that feeling to yourself and let

433
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,199
it pass let that crush go by

434
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,079
but if you are a risk taker you have to

435
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,480
think

436
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,040
very carefully on how to approach that

437
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,800
and the consequences of that because

438
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,839
whether

439
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,760
that becomes a relationship whether that

440
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,600
relationship is successful or goes

441
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,120
sideways

442
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,920
there is a risk to your credibility into

443
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,839
the person's credibility

444
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,399
that you need to be very cognizant of

445
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,000
especially if it's a very small

446
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,959
workplace

447
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,440
it's very clear that you two are cozy

448
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,240
that can have some serious ramifications

449
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,600
so you need to be very careful

450
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,519
how you approach those pieces

451
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,720
uh sometimes though

452
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,320
people particularly of a certain gender

453
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,920
tend to send pictures of their genitalia

454
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,199
and that's fine if you've

455
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,959
asked for it if you have not

456
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,199
then you can send this back to them

457
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,240
right

458
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,320
you should not be starting your

459
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,519
workplace romance

460
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,120
with a dick pic ideally um

461
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,600
i've had more than my sheer fair fair

462
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,480
share as i'm sure

463
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,160
many women and and transgender and

464
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,079
maybe even men are getting them from not

465
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,759
just men but from women

466
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,839
uh sending an intimate photo of any

467
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,320
of any sort especially to a co-worker is

468
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,000
a very bad idea

469
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
so you need to make sure that you have

470
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,160
very specific permission to do that

471
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,240
but you also need to really trust that

472
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,759
person if you're going to do that

473
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,560
it is once it's out there it's out there

474
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,120
i would

475
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,000
recommend highly never doing it if you

476
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,199
are the recipient

477
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,600
of an unsolicited picture you are

478
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,440
welcome to screenshot this

479
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,519
and crop it and send it back to that

480
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,600
person so that they know

481
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,600
this is not acceptable behavior uh

482
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,199
never ever ever do anything

483
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,720
of a remotely sexual nature with a peer

484
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,599
uh or a manager or a sub or a somebody

485
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,319
who

486
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,799
reports to you never do that without

487
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,160
treading very carefully

488
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,280
and asking for consent um

489
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,919
and even then again that default state

490
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:20,720
of just know

491
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,919
is really important

492
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,319
so now that i've given you a bit of a

493
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,400
crash course on what kinds of boundaries

494
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,520
are out there and

495
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,360
and just a few tips on how you can

496
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,039
handle those boundaries i want to talk

497
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:33,440
about

498
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,480
how pushing boundaries becomes abuse and

499
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,400
we talked about this i alluded to this

500
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,039
in that

501
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,840
that initial slide with our mannequins

502
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,760
pushing boundaries can be a very good

503
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,600
thing they can break you out of your

504
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,000
comfort

505
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,720
zone and force you to grow and some of

506
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,160
us like to leap out of

507
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,320
our comfort zone and and force ourselves

508
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,200
to grow

509
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,320
um but pushing boundaries repeatedly

510
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,240
to the point where you have to ask a

511
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,000
person to stop

512
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,760
that's a little less good but that's not

513
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,440
necessarily abusive

514
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,039
maybe you have a friend who knows that

515
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,720
you're an introvert you're you're in

516
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,679
your shell they

517
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,080
want you they they love you and they

518
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,440
want you to grow with them

519
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,960
and that that's a tough call um

520
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,440
but once you ask that person to stop

521
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,200
that then it should stop

522
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,400
right uh if you ask someone to stop

523
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,600
pushing a boundary

524
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,280
and they keep pushing it and it doesn't

525
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,120
matter if that's a physical boundary

526
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,600
an emotional one a verbal one a sexual

527
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,120
one it does not matter

528
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,120
if you have said this makes me

529
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,240
uncomfortable

530
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,200
please stop doing it or just stop doing

531
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,240
it

532
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,559
and they continue hammering on that

533
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:41,600
boundary

534
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,960
now you're getting into abuse

535
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,480
this is a really tough tough area to

536
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,600
navigate

537
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,960
um i think it's it's really important if

538
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,400
you are uncertain

539
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,600
am i overthinking this uh go with your

540
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,400
gut

541
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,480
your gut is really good most of the time

542
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,679
uh if you're still uncertain engage

543
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,760
outside counsel and that that that

544
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,520
counsel does not have to be legal

545
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,240
counsel

546
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,880
that council could be again a life coach

547
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,840
a therapist

548
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,039
a counselor a priest or preacher

549
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,520
um someone that you trust someone that

550
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,760
you feel like has good objectivity

551
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,320
someone who perhaps knows how you think

552
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,480
and run these scenarios by them

553
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,960
and see what their call on this is

554
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,480
because

555
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,880
abuse in the workplace and in life is

556
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,760
pretty rampant

557
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,440
unfortunately a lot of us come from very

558
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,080
toxic

559
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,080
or very traumatic or very abusive

560
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,799
situations uh his children

561
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,400
both male female gender binary

562
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,520
i'm sorry non-binary

563
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,559
there are a lot of places that

564
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,840
abuse is a problem and we carry that

565
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,720
problem with us

566
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
unfortunately we carry those scars with

567
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,880
us and we carry the behaviors that we

568
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,799
learned from abusers and toxic people

569
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,559
with us into the workplace and into the

570
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:05,760
industry

571
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,760
i i think a lot of the gatekeeping that

572
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,120
you see is

573
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,600
is just a kind of a generic abusive

574
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,679
they want to control that space right um

575
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,799
you need to be able to step back

576
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,240
and ask for help to make sure that

577
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,960
you're calling this right that it's a

578
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,360
pushing of a boundary versus abuse

579
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,440
but also perhaps to coach you through

580
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,280
some of it

581
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,960
this slide has brought up a question

582
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,480
that i thought was very interesting at

583
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,320
the last time i gave this talk and

584
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,320
that's how do i tell

585
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,360
a manager who's not a good manager

586
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,039
from a manager who isn't the right

587
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,559
manager for me

588
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,320
you know from a manager who's just

589
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,600
outright abusive

590
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,960
and that again very tough

591
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,760
very tough call sometimes if there's

592
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,320
ever

593
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,360
any physical or sexual interaction

594
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,360
um that's very clear and if there is

595
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,760
don't go to hr hr is there to protect

596
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,400
the company

597
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,880
you need to file a police complaint and

598
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,559
then go to hr

599
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,360
the verbal emotional is much more common

600
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,120
and much harder to prove that's where

601
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,120
you need to take that step back

602
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,120
look to somebody that you trust run

603
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,039
those situations by them

604
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,960
and get that input get that feedback on

605
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,640
what you're seeing and what you're

606
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,440
feeling and in a lot of ways

607
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,080
it almost doesn't i won't say it doesn't

608
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,200
matter whether it's

609
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,840
a manager who is not good for you versus

610
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,360
a manager who's just not very good at

611
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,320
managing

612
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,360
versus a toxic manager because the end

613
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,120
result is that at some point you have to

614
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,159
leave that manager

615
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,080
it's a question of how quickly do you

616
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,080
need to get out the more

617
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,919
they are on that abusive side of the

618
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,799
scale the faster you need to be leaving

619
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,960
um it's it's very destructive to your

620
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,720
mental health and i would encourage you

621
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,280
that if you're in a toxic workplace

622
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,400
and you you have a really good therapist

623
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,559
on speed dial because it will make

624
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,120
all the difference in the world i hope

625
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,320
that you are here if you are

626
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,799
in a toxic workplace i hope that you're

627
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,320
here here and you come to the career

628
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,360
village and you

629
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,679
let us help you find a way out of that

630
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,039
toxic place

631
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,520
uh if it's just a bad manager maybe you

632
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,440
can stay with that company

633
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,840
and move around and if it's a good

634
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,720
manager who

635
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,640
isn't the right manager for you you have

636
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,320
more opportunity to actually have a

637
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,080
discussion with that person

638
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,080
and say this doesn't feel like it's

639
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,240
working i i personally have literally

640
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,799
said to

641
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,280
a new manager in my 30-day review i

642
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,799
don't think i'll be here in 90 days

643
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,240
because it's clear to me that i am not

644
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,480
who you want to dire

645
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,320
i was able to have that conversation

646
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,480
with him because in my judgment

647
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,480
he was a good person he was just not the

648
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,840
right manager for me

649
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,520
and i was correct that i was not the

650
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,440
person he wanted to hire

651
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,440
but i was the right person for the role

652
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,159
and we managed to work that out

653
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,840
uh it's a judgment call

654
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,120
on whether you can have that

655
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,880
conversation with a manager

656
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,080
i hope that you can have that

657
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,840
conversation with your manager if you

658
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,640
feel like you're

659
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,240
reporting to someone who isn't the right

660
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,640
manager for you if i feel like

661
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,320
somebody is reporting to me and i'm not

662
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,000
the right manager for them

663
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,760
i will find them the right manager i

664
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,520
will encourage them especially if

665
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,000
they're a good

666
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,480
worker i want them to stay with the

667
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,039
company

668
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,720
i'm going to encourage them and find

669
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,799
them that right place for them to be

670
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,880
because if we take care of each other

671
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,480
even if we're not right for each other

672
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,600
in a work situation

673
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,679
we're in a personal relationship if we

674
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,200
take care of each other

675
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,480
that's the number one thing we can do

676
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,520
so from that point of view i want you to

677
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,039
think about

678
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,480
where you are now do you feel like

679
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,960
you are on the right side of this image

680
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,320
do you feel like you're on the left side

681
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,520
of this image

682
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,120
do you feel like you have a little more

683
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,520
information perhaps to help you path

684
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,480
your way

685
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,679
across this to the right i hope you do

686
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,279
i know i don't have a lot of time with

687
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,520
you we've got just a few seven minutes

688
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,960
left we could do a little q

689
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,080
a and if not we can meet in the career

690
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,279
village and i will

691
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,880
be happy to answer any questions

692
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,159
if you are coming from a more traumatic

693
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,000
uh life experience

694
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,679
i would encourage you to get help

695
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,039
uh this industry is so hard on us

696
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,159
it's so hard on us from an emotional and

697
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:30,480
from

698
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,799
a psychological point of view we are

699
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,039
constantly fighting an uphill battle

700
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,279
um a lot of us are drawn to this

701
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,120
industry because we've had some kind of

702
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,320
traumatic event and we

703
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,679
really believe in protecting other

704
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,840
people if you

705
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,919
feel like you're going to hurt yourself

706
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:46,880
please

707
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,159
get help if you have been hurt please

708
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,320

709
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,760
hurting someone else

710
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,640
please get help you do not have to keep

711
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,640
doing what you're doing

712
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,760
and yeah incredibly well said i i don't

713
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,640
mean to interrupt

714
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,840
no no no i'm at the end i have a few

715
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,120
questions that i think are really

716
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,200
interesting um overwhelmingly positive

717
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,480
response from the audience

718
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,400
a lot of people are saying i wish she

719
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,919
could come to our company and replace

720
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,840
the training that we have because

721
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,799
this is powerful also they loved you

722
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,600
talking about dick pics i'm just kidding

723
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,200
so i had to add a couple questions can

724
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,360
there be consent between individuals in

725
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:25,840
different

726
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,919
layers of the same reporting structure

727
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,000
like can a senior on a team ever make a

728
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,080
romantic play to junior and have real

729
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,360
consent exist

730
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,919
because of the dynamic that is a really

731
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:36,400
great

732
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,080
question uh it is going to be

733
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,600
exceedingly rare

734
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,559
i i will never say no it will never

735
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:43,279
happen

736
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,799
because then somebody is going to pop up

737
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,320
with the edge case where it did happen

738
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,279
to happen

739
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,440
um i would encourage you if you are

740
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,039
romantically interested

741
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,600
in a subordinate or subordinate find

742
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,799
them another role

743
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,279
in your company so that they are not

744
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,640
reporting to you

745
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,279
and then make your play because i i

746
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,039
think it's absolutely correct

747
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,200
you are putting that person at risk and

748
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,960
you're putting yourself at risk

749
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,440
uh that your other option is go find

750
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,400
another role

751
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,880
um i have absolutely started dating

752
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,400
people that i was working with

753
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,840
after i left the company absolutely

754
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,159
another question what do you do when no

755
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,919
just doesn't work with a colleague

756
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,840
there are situations where reporting

757
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,840
this ends up making the reporting person

758
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,200
be known as a victim

759
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,440
or as the bad person for possibly

760
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,080
unknowingly leading one on

761
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,880
that is so unfortunately common because

762
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,679
like i said

763
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,919
hr is there to protect the company and

764
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,360
not has much to protect

765
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,559
you um i have certainly heard of

766
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,880
situations where someone has victimized

767
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,720
several people at a large corporation i

768
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,880
was and still had their director title

769
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,960
uh even after the metoo movement so that

770
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,080
that

771
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,159
is a real tough one that's i think where

772
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,080
you start engaging outside counsel

773
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,080
not necessarily legal but definitely at

774
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,000
some point legal um

775
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,200
start documenting religiously

776
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,679
if it is a continual effort on that

777
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,240
person's part and no is not an option

778
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,400
if there is a single hr person that you

779
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,240
trust or a manager that you trust that

780
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:12,799
can step

781
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,600
in um i would certainly talk with them

782
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,640
about it

783
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,399
um the problem and and this is a problem

784
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:21,840
especially that

785
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,279
that women and uh minorities and

786
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,320
and lots of people face because when you

787
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,679
complain

788
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,559
you become the problem right and that is

789
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:32,880
a

790
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,799
serious issue and i have never worked at

791
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,080
a company where that wasn't

792
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,120
really an issue to be honest um i'm

793
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,720
gonna have to think on that one because

794
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,440
okay

795
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,159
and this is and again this is a problem

796
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:44,880
because

797
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,279
your usual best options to leave but

798
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,960
that means that you're making a lateral

799
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,399
movement and you're suffering your

800
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:51,840
career is suffering because

801
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,240
this person won't leave you one i'm

802
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,760
really glad you brought up that

803
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,520
hr is there to protect the company and

804
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,440
not the employment i think that's a hard

805
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,320
lesson you

806
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,760
have to learn at some points in our

807
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,159
industry and it's so counter-intuitive

808
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,000
okay i think we have time for one final

809
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,799
question

810
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,799
and i think it's uh i think it sums up a

811
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,399
lot of this quite well how can we start

812
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:11,919
getting our companies to start

813
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,039
incorporating these

814
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,480
key topics oh yeah a couple

815
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,240
corporations aren't good at honesty i

816
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,240
mean that's very very truthful

817
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,600
um these are tough discussions to have

818
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,279
and i'm gonna have to think on that

819
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,840
question that's a i haven't gotten that

820
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,399
question well we can have people

821
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,919
check you out in the career village

822
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,679
right there yeah let's do a panel on

823
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,279
that in the career village uh later

824
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,960
today because i think there are ways to

825
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,399
do it i just uh

826
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,360
usually i'm the person that's advocating

827
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,120
that level of honesty

828
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,399
um but i i don't know

829
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:50,240
