1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,560
okay

2
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,800
today i'm going to talk about web

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,080
application security

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,760
risk involved in web application

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,199
security and

6
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,519
how we can improve the security uh in

7
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,039
web applications

8
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,760
uh something about me i'm a senior

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,559
security engineer at t-mobile washington

10
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,719
uh prior to that i worked in dc

11
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,120
government and bank of america

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,200
i have expertise in web application

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,320
security testing

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,879
architecture risk analysis vendor

15
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:47,520
assessment

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,120
and security training solutions

17
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,320
like i said my agenda for today is to

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,440
talk about how

19
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,239
software and the software complexity is

20
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,160
increasing and how security needs to

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,199
catch up

22
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,159
uh risk and breaches uh and how we need

23
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,040
to improve

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,760
and uh application security risk the

25
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,840
solution which i'm proposing is

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,680
which we all are doing but we are still

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,119
missing a lot of things

28
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,799
how to do it right we're going to talk

29
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,119
about talking about moving left in the

30
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,240
stlc

31
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,840
and then we'll be going through all the

32
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,159
phases of sdlc

33
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,759
and then after that if you have any

34
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,680
questions we can obviously talk about

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,840
those

36
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,320
there was a time when large software

37
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,400
application used to take long time to

38
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,479
complete which is not the case today

39
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,880
agile streams can deliver application

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,040
software in weeks and days now

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,520
speed of software development has

42
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,280
increased and so are the software

43
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,720
security risk

44
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,040
development team is focused on speed and

45
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,840
pushing applications into production

46
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,320
which sometimes committing causing like

47
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,439
hundreds of commits

48
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,520
every day organizations are taking

49
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,960
advantages of cloud platforms on demand

50
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,840
services and continued delivery pipeline

51
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,920
all of these is basically increasing

52
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,239
delivery cycle time

53
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,919
but the main question is where is

54
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,840
security in all of these

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,520
what does security look like in the

56
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,000
world of continuous change

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,560
and how can security team can possibly

58
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,360
keep up with

59
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,080
all these changes we do have some gating

60
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,120
control in place

61
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,520
we have security testing we have dust

62
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,280
which is my bread and butter

63
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,840
we have penetration testing but are

64
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,400
these all sufficient

65
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,519
let's talk about some stats verizon

66
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,400
recently published its 2020 data breach

67
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,680
investigation report

68
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,200
dbir report which analyzed 32

69
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,920
000 security incidents in 16 different

70
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,879
industries

71
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,959
and four different world regions

72
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,640
majority of these breaches

73
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,720
86 percent of them are financially

74
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,760
motivated

75
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,440
more 70 percent are caused by outsiders

76
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,080
and most important the worth noting fact

77
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,560
is

78
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,200
this application were part of more than

79
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,440
43 percent of breaches

80
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,120
more than the double the amount from

81
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,080
last year dbir found that the cause of

82
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,640
the increase in web application breaches

83
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,360
was a result of more people moving their

84
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,159
workflows

85
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,280
to the cloud there was another report

86
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,519
which was stated in state of software

87
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,480
security

88
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,400
which found out that retail industry 40

89
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,440
of applications are only scanned once

90
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,680
a year can you imagine that only once a

91
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,480
year

92
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,640
by increasing the number of scams the

93
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,799
retail industry could find

94
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,840
and remediate more flaws and address

95
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,799
security issues the higher the

96
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,159
percentage of british

97
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,560
breaches will the applications were the

98
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,239
primary attack vector

99
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,799
this shows us that improvement requires

100
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,560
an application security

101
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,879
this is how the critical capitality is

102
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,599
there in the

103
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,720
application security

104
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,200
now i'm gonna talk about application

105
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,799
security risk

106
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,120
in the lighter current pandemic with

107
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,720
more and more businesses

108
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,519
undergoing digital transformation number

109
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,200
of web application breaches

110
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,680
will definitely likely to increase no

111
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,120
doubt in that

112
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,358
application security is becoming an

113
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,240
important priority for all organization

114
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,240
whether you are a multinational company

115
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,400
like netflix or twitter

116
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,400
if your business is online web

117
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,440
application is

118
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,520
important even if your small mom and pop

119
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,440
store if you're going online this is

120
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,479
important for you

121
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,120
it's your customer data it's your brand

122
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,919
value which is

123
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,199
at stake the developments in web

124
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,680
applications and services have improved

125
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,400
the way

126
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,320
that company used to do business like 10

127
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,240
years ago or 20 years ago

128
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,560
they have also increased the risk of

129
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,400
malicious attack as well

130
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,880
simply put the current weak link in most

131
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,840
organization

132
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,000
is the application security which is the

133
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,520
main important discussion we are

134
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,320
going to have right now let's think does

135
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,080
everybody in the organization know that

136
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,000
how many apis you are using

137
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,320
do you even know what data is being

138
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,160
shared in those apis

139
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,160
and how it's being shared how your

140
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,240
customers your partners or vendors are

141
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,160
using those api

142
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,639
many organization are not even keeping

143
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,600
their api

144
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,080
inventory up to date and if you're not

145
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,840
aware of your apis

146
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,320
how will you protect secure and monitor

147
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,120
it

148
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,000
you need to enter all your apis and api

149
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,880
registry

150
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,479
whether it's new api old api ask your

151
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,039
application security team to find those

152
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,960
apis and assess them as well

153
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,840
over here i'm talking about application

154
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,120
security risk

155
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,199
it's important for everyone to know

156
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,600
about some common application security

157
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,240
issues

158
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,120
such as broken authentication exercise

159
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,199
sensitive information disclosure

160
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,759
injection session management i know a

161
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,759
lot of us are familiar with all of these

162
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,080
so i'm not going into detail already on

163
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,440
all of these issues

164
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,840
but yes i'm going to highlight os top 10

165
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,160
here which is a top 10 vulnerability and

166
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,840
it's an industry standard we have to

167
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:20,479
cover those

168
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,600
what is moving lessons sdlc let's talk

169
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,880
about what's happening in the

170
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,960
organizations organizations are trying

171
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,720
to secure the application

172
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,280
they're following industry standard best

173
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,160
practices

174
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,400
to invest in penetration testing the

175
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,080
application firewall

176
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,520
but despite these efforts many apsec

177
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,720
initiatives fall short and they fail to

178
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,039
adequately secure business critical

179
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,400
functions

180
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,440
so what to do the best solution is to

181
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,319
use a security software development life

182
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,120
cycle

183
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,080
secure stlc and start security

184
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,880
discussion

185
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,080
right from the design phase so

186
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,160
whether you are developing application

187
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,280
in-house

188
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,440
outsource development or purchasing

189
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,479
application from

190
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,960
outside vendor you must be able to

191
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,680
ensure

192
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,080
that secure development practices are

193
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,840
being followed

194
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,280
interestingly there are many studies

195
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,240
that shows

196
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,759
it's faster easier and cheaper to find

197
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,560
and fix secure software issues early in

198
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,400
the development cycle

199
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,039
when coders are actually writing their

200
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:29,599
code

201
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,840
rather than waiting in the testing on

202
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,960
the qf phase

203
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,800
and in the production hopefully we are

204
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,639
not doing that in production

205
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,039
but yes we it's important to assess your

206
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:39,840
application

207
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,759
and the early stages of the sdlc cycle

208
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,680
security should be baked into the

209
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,319
process from the start

210
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,919
so we need to move left moving left

211
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:52,560
eliminate

212
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,680
unnecessarily workload instead of fixing

213
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,319
the issue

214
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,039
identified in penetration testing which

215
00:07:59,039 --> 00:07:59,840
happens

216
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,560
after your code is already in production

217
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,599
development team

218
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,039
should work instead in the earlier cycle

219
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,039
to find security vulnerability

220
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,360
security team should be involved from

221
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,440
the start of the sclc cycle

222
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,560
here i'm talking if you can see on a

223
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,960
slide here are the different phases of

224
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,560
sdlc cycle

225
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,080
each step in the sdlc requires its own

226
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,680
security enforcement and tooling

227
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,760
from design to the test to the

228
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,799
deployment

229
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,760
each phase is extremely important and we

230
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,360
have to make sure we are following

231
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,000
security

232
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,120
in each and every phase i'm going to

233
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,600
walk you through each and every phase

234
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,959
and we will talk about

235
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,600
how application team and security

236
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,160
engineer

237
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,720
have to work together to achieve the

238
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,320
common goal of defense

239
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,360
in depth and secure your application and

240
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,720
customers sensitive data

241
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,519
security requirements should cover

242
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,680
security policies mechanism

243
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,920
to enforce those security policies

244
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,800
authentication

245
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,680
authorization so you don't have to wait

246
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,600
you need to involve your security

247
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,760
engineer right from the design phase

248
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,800
right from the beginning

249
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,040
let's talk about the design phase first

250
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,920
it is critical to involve security team

251
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,320
to review the design document perform

252
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,600
threat modeling

253
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,160
write down all the security requirement

254
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,080
that needs to be considered

255
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,240
it is extremely critical when

256
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,480
application requirements are defined

257
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,279
the corresponding security requirements

258
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,279
should also be defined

259
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,320
yes that's where we are lacking

260
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,160
security requirement should cover

261
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,760
security policies

262
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,519
cia mechanism to enforce those policies

263
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,920
so you don't have to wait it means you

264
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,160
should involve a security engineer

265
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,240
when you are creating a design document

266
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,760
and i'm repeating here because it's

267
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,600
really really important

268
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,440
security engineer will review your

269
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,720
design document

270
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,800
work with the application team to

271
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
improve the security posture of the

272
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,279
entire application

273
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,360
so let's talk about what a security

274
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,880
engineer gonna do

275
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,399
so there are common questions the

276
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,399
security engineers going to ask about

277
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:20,720
and

278
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,120
about the development team about the

279
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,240
application

280
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,640
so on this let's go to the next slide

281
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,959
first

282
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,120
on this slide you can see a list of few

283
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,000
questions

284
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,720
which you need to think about and most

285
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,800
importantly security engineer

286
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,360
will ask you these questions while doing

287
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,240
a design review of your application

288
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,720
so the first question is is there a data

289
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,399
flow architecture diagram of an

290
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,360
application

291
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,600
and you'll be like it seems so simple

292
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,760
right but it's not

293
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,320
that's where we are missing i hate to

294
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,800
say

295
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,440
not all applications have a data flow

296
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,399
diagram

297
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,399
and i'm not talking about legacy

298
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,600
application

299
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,920
it's extremely important to have a data

300
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,839
flow architecture diagram

301
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,240
you need to understand all the entry

302
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,560
points of your application you need to

303
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:14,880
know

304
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,600
all the components involved and assess

305
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,000
them

306
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,440
individually next is

307
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,279
you need to know what is the data

308
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,519
classification is it restricted is it

309
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,399
confidential

310
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,680
is a pci so if it's going to be

311
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,560
restricted

312
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,920
if it's involving ssn yeah if

313
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,720
uh if you have date of birth if you have

314
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,839
billing information

315
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,320
it's all restricted if there is a

316
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,519
payment history

317
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,920
your credit rating then it's pci

318
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,760
information

319
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,720
if you are dealing with the ein number

320
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,000
your ipn number

321
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,720
then it's your confidential information

322
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,120
depending upon the type of the data you

323
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,880
are dealing with you need to have

324
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,000
controls in place and the main reason

325
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,639
why we are discussing this because you

326
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,519
need to set

327
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,680
appropriate controls based on the

328
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,000
classification of your data

329
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,720
you will be surprised to know how many

330
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,760
developers

331
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,079
keep the confidential information in the

332
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,920
plain text

333
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,639
so imagine if you're a hacker and you

334
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,200
found

335
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,399
unencrypted credit card information

336
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,680
yes it's unencrypted it will it will

337
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,000
make

338
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,480
hacker's job super easy he doesn't need

339
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,079
to do anything

340
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,480
think about it think about it when that

341
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,639
credit card information is stolen

342
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,680
it's attacked as an attacker's hand

343
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,920
so how what about customer trust and

344
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,040
business it's impacted big time

345
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,000
so what we need to do so it's if it's

346
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,120
confidential data

347
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,480
you should encrypt it and not only that

348
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,720
you need to make sure you are using

349
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,720
latest algorithm

350
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,360
because obsolete algorithms are not

351
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,320
going to help you

352
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,240
obsolete algorithm have their own

353
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,440
security flaws

354
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,560
which make them insecure and vulnerable

355
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,800
so you have to make use of latest

356
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,519
algorithm

357
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,320
so next we talk about if there are any

358
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,839
apis involved

359
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,200
how those apis are exposed so if your

360
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,040
application has apis so let's say yes

361
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,880
you have those apis so the question

362
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,760
comes is is it intended for internal use

363
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,920
external use or how who's going to

364
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,839
access those apis who's the end user

365
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,480
so it was intended for internal use it

366
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,880
should not be exposed to public

367
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,920
in my experience i have seen many

368
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,560
internal apis which were exposed to

369
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,519
public

370
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,199
yes it sound crazy right some of those

371
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,240
api had

372
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,440
restricted information and as it has a

373
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,040
restricted information

374
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,480
it was a high critical security issue

375
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,959
sorry about that how critical security

376
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,000
issue to expose those internal apis

377
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,199
any hacker could have it easily exploit

378
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,120
those apis over the internet

379
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,639
and since this has a restricted

380
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,560
information is the biggest impact on the

381
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,360
business

382
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,720
and and the brand value of course i have

383
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,120
seen

384
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,760
many application owners who um don't

385
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,839
know they are unaware of the security

386
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,240
what they are doing is they are exposing

387
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,199
this api

388
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,360
so that their third-party vendor can

389
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,720
access it

390
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,000
because they that's the reason they

391
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,320
think about it but in that case

392
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,320
what you can do if you have a similar

393
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,440
scenario

394
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,000
you should set some restrictions based

395
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,600
on ip address

396
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,639
only those provision ip addresses can

397
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,399
access those apis

398
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,399
nobody else if your api

399
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,760
is intended for external use

400
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,480
for public use make sure it's behind

401
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,839
your web application

402
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,720
firewall it should also be registered in

403
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,839
your api

404
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,040
inventory record now

405
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,240
let's talk about vendors are vendors or

406
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,680
third party involved within that

407
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,720
application

408
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,720
did those vendors have a security

409
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,639
evaluation

410
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,639
interesting questions right this is a

411
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,440
blind spot in many organizations

412
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,600
not just the new vendors you are dealing

413
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,680
with if there is an old vendor

414
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,839
you are working from last five or let's

415
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:22,959
say 10 years

416
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,199
you have to make sure there's a security

417
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,560
engineer assigned

418
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,440
to perform vendor assessment on that if

419
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,079
there is an

420
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,839
old contract that doesn't have a

421
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,279
security requirement

422
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,920
then you have to make sure your supplier

423
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,880
management team

424
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,440
can renew contract only when there is a

425
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,639
security requirement in place

426
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,560
that's where your security engineer will

427
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,160
help you

428
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,639
just like your internal application when

429
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,399
they have to go through the regular

430
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,079
testing design reviews

431
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,320
penetration testing because it's your

432
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,079
customer data at the end

433
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,560
and it has and you are the company as a

434
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,480
company you have to review that

435
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,079
vendor is doing what they are supposed

436
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,079
to do

437
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,800
now let's talk about is there a regular

438
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
patch management code scan

439
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,839
internal external testing been done

440
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,160
so you have to ask the application owner

441
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,440
when was the last time

442
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,959
the application was assessed

443
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,160
is it the part of the patch management

444
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,040
if it's not

445
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,399
it's a red flag same goes to the regular

446
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,040
white box testing and annual penetration

447
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,720
testing

448
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,480
there's a general recommendation

449
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,959
industry-wide that you should always do

450
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,199
patch management once a month

451
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,680
uh now we are actually going more

452
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,480
frequent

453
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,120
uh that's actually the bare minimum once

454
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,759
a month

455
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,079
uh white box vulnerability management

456
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,800
quarterly

457
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,839
and annual penetration

458
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,639
similarly there are many other things i

459
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,639
can talk about

460
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,240
there are big lists you can see right

461
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,920
now i can go launch

462
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,240
in each and every list the many other

463
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,759
questions which are very important and

464
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:02,959
you have to ask

465
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,640
your application owner like

466
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,199
infrastructure your network security

467
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,000
your authentication method the big list

468
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,280
i'm not going through

469
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,720
all of the lists because of the time

470
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,640
constraint but yes that's really

471
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,839
important to think in mind

472
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,520
okay so next move to the next

473
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,079
build phase

474
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,200
this is a time when developers start

475
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,640
writing their code

476
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,039
there are many plugins which can be used

477
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:35,679
to find

478
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,559
security flaws right away it's essential

479
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:38,880
to

480
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,520
assess security code regularly and the

481
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,880
best way is to

482
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,280
integrate code scanning with ci cd

483
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,320
pipeline

484
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,440
which means every time you build you

485
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,160
commit

486
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,960
a code a new scan will be done and new

487
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,840
issues will be identified

488
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,400
code scanning is really really important

489
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,080
many high critical issues

490
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,799
such as hard-coded password can be

491
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,720
identified in the code scanning

492
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,919
right in the build phase fixing such

493
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,640
issues a lot quicker in the build phase

494
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,280
without

495
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,640
causing any delay in the release cycle

496
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,400
fix some issues identified and the

497
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,080
source code is really really important

498
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,760
because it's a low hanging fruit

499
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,440
you really don't want to miss it because

500
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,039
it has a really high

501
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,240
potential risk impact

502
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,200
industry-wide number of code scan issues

503
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,559
are generally higher

504
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,160
when you compare it with your web

505
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,960
application your penetration testing

506
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,039
but it is critical to address those

507
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,640
findings and verify if it's fixed or not

508
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,960
and most importantly we have to make a

509
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,679
plan

510
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,720
to fix any open issues you have to track

511
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,760
those issues

512
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,799
have flas someone should be accountable

513
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,480
for those potential risk

514
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,799
otherwise it will never get fixed

515
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,960
another critical thing in this phase is

516
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,600
to give security awareness training

517
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,720
to the deaf team educate them educate

518
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,919
them about the security best practices

519
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,160
it's it's your job at the end you're a

520
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,919
security engineer

521
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,559
many a time deaf teams are not aware of

522
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,000
key risk factor

523
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,840
then they know they don't know what's

524
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,120
the risk involved with the

525
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,160
data security privacy some employees are

526
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,120
misinformed

527
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,400
confused ignore it yeah

528
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,400
many don't understand that cyber

529
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,760
security is their personal

530
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,039
responsibility

531
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,200
and even there are few they don't even

532
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,080
know about

533
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,240
sensitive data privacy best practices

534
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,080
which is really important

535
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,200
security is everybody's responsibility

536
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,760
even a small mistake can have bigger

537
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,280
consequences

538
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,520
so that's why security awareness

539
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,600
training will help everyone in the

540
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,720
organization to be on the same page

541
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,799
and eventually this will reduce risk

542
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,000
into the incident

543
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,600
and help the entire workplace

544
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,760
now i'm going to the next phase which is

545
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,240
our

546
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,600
test and release phase

547
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,280
so it's really important to perform

548
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,039
testing in the non-production

549
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,880
environment before going into the

550
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,480
development phase

551
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,120
here we want to test our web application

552
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,679
which it

553
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,919
should be yes that's really important

554
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,000
which should be a middle image of your

555
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,760
production environment

556
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,520
in this phase we will test web

557
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,760
applications apis

558
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,520
before they actually go into the

559
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,799
production

560
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,039
in this phase we're going to test about

561
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,960
many scenarios like session management

562
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,039
cross-site scripting

563
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,120
however in the last phase where we

564
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,200
perform the source code testing which is

565
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,360
independent of this testing this here

566
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,799
we're talking about web application and

567
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:45,679
api

568
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,600
the last time that you talk about the

569
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,000
hard-coded password let's say

570
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,600
those are different than the issues

571
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,520
identified in this phase

572
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,280
because here we are dealing with the

573
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,360
real time application

574
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,880
and the last one we were dealing with

575
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,679
the scanning the static code

576
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,320
but it's really important to test both

577
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,919
and both are really individually

578
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,559
important

579
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,640
and we are supposed they're not supposed

580
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,600
to miss any of those

581
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,640
last is our deployment base in this

582
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,480
phase your code is already in production

583
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,559
you have already done all the checklists

584
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,240
so what's next

585
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,039
very important your security is still

586
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:27,600
important

587
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,080
security does not stop because you have

588
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,200
reached deployment and

589
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,480
implementation because even after

590
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,200
deployment

591
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,159
and implementation security practices

592
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,840
need to be followed

593
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,000
we need to be continuously test our

594
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,320
application for any new vulnerabilities

595
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,039
there are

596
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,120
tons of zero-day vulnerabilities so we

597
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,400
need to make sure that we are

598
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,240
continuously testing those

599
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,159
it's a good practice to perform a

600
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,919
regular penetration test on the

601
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,840
production environment

602
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,159
so now what's next we talked about all

603
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,600
the phases

604
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,320
implementing security sdlc helps you

605
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,559
follow security best practices

606
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,120
integrating security activities and

607
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,360
checkup across development phase

608
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,280
this will help you increase the

609
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,600
basically the posture of your security

610
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,679
posture of your organization

611
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,600
but you have to create a security

612
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,960
culture you have to

613
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,960
work with the development team not

614
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,080
against them

615
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,400
you it's a collaborative effort you have

616
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,919
to make it fun you have to make it

617
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,760
education for them

618
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,600
so there are various ways to make it fun

619
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,360
you can have team competitions you can

620
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,720
have hackathon

621
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,039
there are fun ways to involve everyone

622
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:41,840
in your journey

623
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,080
of securing web application because it's

624
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,240
your own organization and it's your own

625
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,280
customer data and the

626
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,960
last thing that i'm going to talk about

627
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,559
measure the practices

628
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,200
have a dashboard track your high risk

629
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,559
application

630
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,360
number of open security issues how much

631
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,880
time people are spending

632
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,960
in fixing those open issues are they

633
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,640
actually getting fixed or they are open

634
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,600
from a long time

635
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,520
because if they are open for a long time

636
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,360
then you have to escalate it you have to

637
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,799
make somebody accountable

638
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,960
so have a dashboard and make sure it's

639
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,520
being regularly updated

640
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,919
and have list all the top 10 security

641
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,919
issues in your organization

642
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,120
and last measure plan and keep improving

643
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,400
with moving left in the stlc that's all

644
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,000
i have for today

645
