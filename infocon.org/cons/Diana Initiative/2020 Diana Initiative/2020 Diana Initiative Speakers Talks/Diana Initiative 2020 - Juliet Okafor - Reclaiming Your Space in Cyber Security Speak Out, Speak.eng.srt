about the ways in which i've been able

140
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,520
to successfully reclaim my space

141
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,759
i want to start by talking to you about

142
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,400
where this story all began

143
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,520
i am a an attorney

144
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,600
i am the mother of two children

145
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,360
and my my rise

146
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,160
inside of cyber did not come the way

147
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,639
many

148
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,600
of you might expect some of you know my

149
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,319
story

150
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,840
i was laid off from my job

151
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,160
in 2013 at the same time i was pregnant

152
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,680
with my daughter

153
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,600
and i was unable to get a job and so

154
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,520
i stayed out of work for about 10 months

155
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,440
and in doing so

156
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,759
i prayed i fasted

157
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,560
and i begged for an opportunity to come

158
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:38,880
up

159
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,880
that would make it so that i would never

160
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,199
ever have to beg

161
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,520
again

162
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,400
in 2014 i applied to a job online

163
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,919
it was a job for a sales executive

164
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,800
for an mssp in ashburn the company was

165
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,240
trueshield

166
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,319
and i applied to it on craigslist

167
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,599
i don't know how many of you guys use

168
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,960
craigslist now but i would say don't

169
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,560
but i'm glad that i did at that time

170
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,400
they had a position for an account

171
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,479
executive i would be leading the sales

172
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,039
team

173
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,720
in fact they had no sales team i would

174
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,560
actually be the first sales person the

175
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,240
ceo would hire

176
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,440
so what i did i applied

177
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,639
they responded and i drove over

178
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,680
two hours to get to this interview

179
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,880
that's how desperate i was but nothing

180
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,960
at that time could stop me

181
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,080
i was determined to be successful

182
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,479
and i begged god that if i got one

183
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,680
opportunity

184
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,800
if they cracked open the door

185
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,280
that i would kick it down and so i did

186
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,680
i got i aced the interview i was off of

187
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,479
the job

188
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,080
and i drove two hours each way

189
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,759
for about a year i finally ended up

190
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,440
leaving trueshield

191
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,919
to get another job at a better company

192
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,080
and by the time i had left

193
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,080
i by the time i started i was making

194
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,840
sixty thousand dollars

195
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,319
and by the time i got to my second role

196
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,520
i was making well

197
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,879
into the two hundreds of thousands of

198
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,960
dollars because i had

199
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,319
proven myself and i'd done an expedition

200
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,639
expeditiously i done it unapologetically

201
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,800
and i did it because i had no other

202
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,120
choice

203
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,240
i'm also the daughter of chiefs

204
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,760
i'm nigerian and my grandmother

205
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,479
my father and my uncle are all chiefs

206
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,320
that made me

207
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,600
actually a princess at a very young age

208
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,000
and as a nigerian american there was no

209
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,720
question

210
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,600
that i had to be successful it was never

211
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,680
something i even thought about

212
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,480
my options were to either be a lawyer

213
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,519
a doctor a professor

214
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,399
or an engineer my brother indicated he

215
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,000
wanted to be a doctor

216
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,560
and i watching matlock at four said i

217
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,880
was going to be lawyer

218
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,240
and so i basically created my entire

219
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,440
life

220
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,360
around this profession that i knew

221
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,519
nothing about at four years old except

222
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,360
i loved matlock and at the end he always

223
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,440
solved the case

224
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,399
so who wouldn't love that

225
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,560
as i started to progress in my career

226
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,160
within cyber it became clear to me

227
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,920
that at times that were most

228
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,279
instrumental

229
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,480
in my life the times that seemed the

230
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,480
saddest

231
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,600
i was always able to rely

232
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,959
on my very known history

233
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,920
my legacy what i knew i had to do for my

234
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,680
ancestors

235
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,120
or on just plain grit

236
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,160
pushing through never failing

237
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,640
and always always succeeding

238
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,600
and so many people don't even know that

239
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,079
when i

240
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,800
started my career in cyber security it

241
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,760
allowed me

242
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,040
to get off of welfare

243
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,079
i was a mother of two children who was

244
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,680
literally taking money from the state of

245
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,360
maryland because she could not support

246
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,760
herself

247
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,519
so imagine a princess

248
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,560
a lawyer on welfare

249
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,240
that's my truth that's who i was

250
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,640
but it wasn't going to be what defined

251
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,760
me

252
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,760
and in fact i'm not her anymore

253
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,440
i will never be her again those times

254
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,600
are behind me

255
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,519
so part of my strategy

256
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,399
in excelling and accelerating in this

257
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,240
industry

258
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,240
was that i created a really strong

259
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,360
network

260
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,320
from the beginning

261
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,880
as a salesperson in cyber security

262
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,839
you can imagine people did not want to

263
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,000
talk to me in fact

264
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,079
very literally they would run away from

265
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,120
me

266
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,920
and in doing so kind of started to feel

267
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,399
like a pariah

268
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,680
i felt some sort of way about it

269
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,560
but what i recognized is that they just

270
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,720
needed to know me they needed to get to

271
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,200
know me better

272
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,680
and quite honestly when they found out i

273
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,000
was a salesperson who was an attorney

274
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,279
they really didn't want to get to know

275
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,880
me but we'll come back to that that's a

276
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,600
separate

277
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,440
conversation altogether

278
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,000
i spent every day

279
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,240
i was in the office until 10 o'clock at

280
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,040
night

281
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,880
sitting in a sock building

282
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,000
new solutions for customers because

283
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,120
if i were to sell something and i could

284
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,360
be a resource

285
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,320
then i could be of help and they would

286
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,720
come

287
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,000
find me that was my trick

288
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,519
i drew people to me why because

289
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,440
everybody else was cold calling and i

290
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,560
never loved to cold call

291
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,639
but i'd always known in my sales career

292
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,880
that my relationships would be the

293
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,560
things that i could lean on

294
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,079
in order to raise business

295
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,240
so in about 2015 um i went to my boss

296
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,920
and said hey

297
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,040
i think it's time for a race that year i

298
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,480
blew it out of the park

299
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,680
i was brought on to start their

300
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,519
commercial practice

301
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,000
flew to zambia helped their team to

302
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,240
build out the first sock in the bank of

303
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,320
zanaco

304
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,440
worked with the ciso even after to to

305
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,880
continue to deploy and make sure the

306
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,880
solution was up and running

307
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,440
i was managing teams in the philippines

308
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,160
this is in my first year

309
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,639
i was also i'd also replaced my boss i

310
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,639
went from account executive to director

311
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:20,959
in

312
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,320
four months so i walk in

313
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,639
so of course i was entitled to my raise

314
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,279
i knew that

315
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,440
he didn't agree and i remember it being

316
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,200
late at night

317
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,920
it'd been a long day i checked on the

318
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,160
kids

319
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,600
walked into his office and said

320
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,160
you know i've got a nanny now i've got

321
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,120
expenses

322
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,600
i have to travel i really need a raise

323
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,079
and he had and at that time he had given

324
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,839
me a raise to 80 000

325
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,959
but i was making a minimum of

326
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,040
three million dollars for him a year

327
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,440
minimum

328
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,199
and he said he laughed

329
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,480
he said no one is going to pay you that

330
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,480
much

331
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,920
if you leave here you've been in the

332
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,360
industry less than a year yes you've

333
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,399
been doing good work

334
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,240
but you will never make more than eighty

335
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,760
thousand dollars in a year

336
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,399
i walked out of his office i packed up

337
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,240
my things

338
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,040
and i drove home

339
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,360
that night it was two either 202 or 208

340
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,480
my phone lit up and it

341
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,399
was linkedin linkedin had a job

342
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,320
announcement and it was for

343
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,720
the vp of information security at

344
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,760
fortress

345
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,320
and so of course i said yeah

346
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,760
they're not gonna pick me he just you

347
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,560
know he's already told me no one wants

348
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,720
someone with with the least experience i

349
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,560
have

350
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,839
but i come from

351
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,600
kings and chiefs

352
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,040
i applied because

353
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,079
i wouldn't he had told me that

354
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,040
i wasn't worth more i wasn't quite so

355
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,839
sure now i

356
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,800
did question whether or not i should be

357
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,320
making this much

358
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,079
but it didn't stop me from doing the

359
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,839
thing i thought i needed to do to get

360
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,480
the position

361
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,680
two months of interviews flying back and

362
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,800
forth

363
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,920
i was offered the job my

364
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,479
salary went up four times

365
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,279
that didn't even include commission

366
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,000
because

367
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,279
someone else had figured out what my

368
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,800
boss couldn't

369
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,600
that i was worth more than i had been

370
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,920
paid

371
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,480
and part of this conversation today is

372
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,959
you are worth more than people tell you

373
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,560
and the people who tell you

374
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,680
that you aren't valuable or worth what

375
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,680
it is you think you're worth

376
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,079
you're in the wrong space

377
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,600
he didn't want to tear me down

378
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,279
but he also didn't want me to leave

379
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,759
and a lot of us women find ourselves in

380
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:30,399
a position

381
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,519
of wanting to do what we think is right

382
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,560
wanting to be loyal and not that there's

383
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,959
anything wrong with that except

384
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,800
when the loyalty to someone else

385
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,959
conflicts with your loyalty to yourself

386
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,360
your best interests your family

387
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,959
your goals then there should be no

388
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,758
loyalty at all

389
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,880
i became the first employee

390
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,600
of a startup that didn't even exist when

391
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,040
we started it

392
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,919
i was the mail woman i was the

393
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,160
accountant i was a graphic designer

394
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,799
i did marketing i was the attorney but i

395
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:11,520
was so

396
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,559
glad for the opportunity and to be in

397
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,359
that space

398
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,919
it was scary as hell i'll tell you

399
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,959
my family my community thought i was

400
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,959
nuts to fly myself

401
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,720
to orlando to meet with two guys

402
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,480
who may or may not give me a job

403
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,440
and risk a job that i knew

404
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,799
i had was stable would never lose but i

405
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,559
had to do it

406
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,280
and i had to do it because i could not

407
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,360
allow his belief about me to keep me

408
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,799
down

409
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:55,840
i had to see if what was over this

410
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,679
unknown was worth it

411
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,840
i was more afraid of what i would miss

412
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,760
out on

413
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,400
than what i would lose in staying where

414
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:06,880
i was

415
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,240
i could have stayed it would have been

416
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,320
easier

417
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,919
but i didn't and i haven't regretted it

418
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,080
since

419
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,880
people always ask me how did you get to

420
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,280
where you are

421
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,440
how did you get into cyber

422
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,640
and i tell them i didn't find cyber

423
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,600
cyber found me

424
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,799
i humbly admit that i was

425
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,600
desperate to get into cyber security i

426
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,000
no

427
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,760
i was desperate to get a job

428
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,600
it just so happened to be cyber sales

429
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,240
job

430
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,679
that i then leveraged to get a position

431
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,919
in um as a vp which then made me

432
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,440
an expert because of all the things i

433
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,440
had to learn which allowed me to

434
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,120
transition into a cyber professional

435
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,360
role

436
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,360
you you you miss all the opportunities

437
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,320
that you don't try for

438
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,000
part of the the obstacles that i've had

439
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,960
to overcome

440
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,520
to get where i am those have been

441
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,840
painful

442
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,280
because the winds teach you lessons

443
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,400
and the losses teach you lessons the

444
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,799
pleasure teaches you lessons

445
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,200
and the pain teach you lessons i've

446
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:39,840
learned

447
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,400
a ton of lessons and i'm learning them

448
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,039
and i'm putting my body on the line

449
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,600
every day

450
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,280
so that other women don't have to learn

451
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,639
the painful lessons i've learned

452
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,600
several years ago i

453
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,960
in about 2016-2017

454
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,360
i had an experience that really

455
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,440
almost shook me to the core

456
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,960
it was a lesson in

457
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,400
the bro culture

458
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,440
it was a lesson in

459
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,120
spaces that i could see but would never

460
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,000
step foot in

461
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,159
and it was about i don't know that i

462
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,840
feel like they tried to minimize me but

463
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,120
i know that they

464
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,678
were very clear that i didn't belong

465
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,159
and so there was a meeting

466
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,440
and we were in another meeting

467
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,960
and everybody else had been invited to

468
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,280
go

469
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,200
to the next meeting and of course i'm

470
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,760
the only woman

471
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,520
the next meeting was going to be after

472
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,679
hours and there were going to be drinks

473
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,000
and there were going to be fun and

474
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
stories and all sorts of things

475
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,679
i was not invited to go

476
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,440
and it was so

477
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,480
clear and visceral

478
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,520
that they were excluding me

479
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:28,840
that i was shocked first and then i was

480
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,480
mad

481
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,600
i was mad for a while

482
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,120
because i questioned

483
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,360
all the things that i was doing to put

484
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,720
my body

485
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,960
physically on the line for my job

486
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,480
long nights no sleep

487
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,760
on the road every day every night

488
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,200
leaving my children last minute

489
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,919
deadlines and in the end

490
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,440
it literally did not matter

491
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,760
i don't know if it's because i'm black

492
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,200
or because i'm a woman

493
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,480
or because i'm strong

494
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,919
that didn't matter it was about the fact

495
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,440
that someone

496
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,240
wanted to make it clear to me that i did

497
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:18,799
not

498
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,200
belong

499
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,240
and so i took some time off

500
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,200
i took time to really think about what

501
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,240
it was

502
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,799
that i really wanted to do here

503
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:41,440
and i spent a lot of time

504
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,640
questioning myself really feeling my

505
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,799
energy what is the matter why does this

506
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:47,919
bother you

507
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:54,320
why are you so upset

508
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,000
i don't even think i told you guys and

509
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,120
i'll walk back a little bit

510
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,960
there was an incident specifically that

511
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,480
happened and

512
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,400
and the being left out of the meeting

513
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,840
came after that

514
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,679
i was at that time senior vice president

515
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,520
i was on a conference call that i was

516
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,320
leading i had traveled to new york

517
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,679
and so i was in this like hotel and i

518
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:22,159
just got

519
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,039
into the room putting my bags down and i

520
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:25,840
logged into the

521
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,280
to the call and apparently there was

522
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,799
something going on with my earphones

523
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:37,520
so i begin the meeting

524
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,000
and there are myself and three gentlemen

525
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,600
um on my team i begin the meeting

526
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,799
and i'm talking and talking and then

527
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,640
the guys are like hey you jules we can't

528
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,080
hear you we can't hear you

529
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,840
so i'm like oh let me fix it we can't

530
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,919
hear you one of the guys

531
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,039
says to me you need to fix your effing

532
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,400
phone

533
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,600
it's bothering me in my ear it's hurting

534
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,320
my ears you need to fix it

535
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,200
just like that

536
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,760
i was at the top

537
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,440
of the proverbial food chain in that

538
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,840
organization

539
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,520
and so i immediately thought let me

540
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,400
reach out and see

541
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,159
let me text my boss and see

542
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,760
if he thinks that this behavior is okay

543
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,960
you know what the first response was

544
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,400
well what did you do i said nothing

545
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,080
i didn't do anything to him i'm not sure

546
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,840
where this you know this anger is coming

547
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,720
from

548
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,200
he said there's no way he could have

549
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,480
blown up on you and you didn't do

550
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,120
anything what did you do

551
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,000
and if the being cursed that wasn't

552
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,279
enough the being yelled at wasn't enough

553
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,279
then being accused of having done

554
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,440
something to deserve it

555
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,919
was the final straw for me

556
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,679
i just couldn't take it

557
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,720
think about what i had just said

558
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,240
i had gone to a on a trip i had left

559
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,559
again my children

560
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,159
i had been running into the hotel to get

561
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,679
to my phone

562
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,840
and i was yelled at by somebody who was

563
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,000
in a lesser role than me

564
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,480
for bothering him because my earphone

565
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,080
was too loud

566
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,720
and then my boss would do absolutely

567
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,600
nothing to fix it

568
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,279
in fact he wanted me to fix myself

569
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,200
and after that

570
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,520
i drafted an email communicated it

571
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,640
and i was told to take some time off

572
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,559
i did came back and

573
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,840
the bro hood started

574
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,200
i was excluded made to feel different

575
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,600
told i was a troublemaker all these

576
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,399
things happened

577
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,080
i i i was already i think

578
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,279
on my on the end of burning out i'd gone

579
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,039
through a divorce that year

580
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,679
you know i was on the road more

581
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:26,960
frequently

582
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,720
some of the really good guys i used to

583
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,159
work with they left we were on a really

584
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,840
tough project that was failing and that

585
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,039
i had to keep rescuing

586
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,400
and i just i said i gotta step away

587
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,919
i can't do this anymore i can't do this

588
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,320
anymore

589
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,679
and part of what i didn't know then

590
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,360
that i know now at least what's been my

591
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,279
experience

592
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,360
the things that pop up like this are not

593
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,679
always about the person

594
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,919
that i'm in the conflict with

595
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,799
the conflict is occurring because i've

596
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,000
outgrown the space

597
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,000
the conflict is occurring because i

598
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,159
stayed beyond

599
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,760
the time i knew i probably should have

600
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,480
left it was occurring because

601
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,600
there were indications in red flags that

602
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,880
i was no longer wanted and i continue to

603
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,279
persist

604
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,440
we have to know when it's time to pick

605
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,039
up

606
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,120
we have to know when the space is no

607
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,520
longer serving us

608
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,039
because ladies space

609
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,600
matters

610
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,960
space matters

611
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,720
and let me talk to you about why space

612
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,120
matters

613
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,520
whenever i think about space

614
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,640
think about open spaces

615
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,000
space is also what determines

616
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,720
a place

617
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,240
whatever spaces you occupy create places

618
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,640
where you

619
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,840
exist

620
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,799
countless people will tell you that

621
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,200
it's not

622
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,480
important that someone is violating your

623
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,320
space

624
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,480
but naturally when someone violates your

625
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,679
space you feel uncomfortable

626
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,640
and that's a physical manifestation

627
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,200
but in the professional setting

628
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,399
you start to feel uncomfortable

629
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,600
and on edge and anxious

630
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,960
and stressed and having panic attacks

631
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,919
when the space no longer serves you

632
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,399
and without a space there is no place

633
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:13,120
for you

634
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,799
and there's no place where you belong

635
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,159
see because space matters

636
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,440
because it creates places and we are

637
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,760
all searching for places where we belong

638
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,320
it is natural and human to us we

639
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,158
just want to belong

640
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,919
so i took that as a sign

641
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,840
that we had gone far enough

642
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,480
and i moved on

643
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,399
it was time to find another

644
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,840
space

645
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,799
in 2019 i chose to open

646
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,760
revolution cyber

647
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,240
revolution cyber is

648
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,919
a game changer personally

649
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,559
and professionally because i had been

650
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,720
killing myself in someone else's

651
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,279
business and then denying myself

652
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:31,360
the joy of owning what i created

653
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,799
and my that was my personal agony

654
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,159
and i didn't even know i was battling

655
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,240
that but

656
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,360
i knew i was good

657
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,919
i didn't understand why other people

658
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:44,960
couldn't appreciate

659
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,399
how good i was and so i felt like i

660
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:52,399
always had to minimize myself

661
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:57,919
i felt like i was too much

662
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,679
and when i took the time off and started

663
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,039
to think about where i could put

664
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,320
my too much to use

665
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,240
i thought it was time to start my

666
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,840
company

667
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,880
and i named it revolution cyber because

668
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,200
it was time for a change

669
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,399
if you've recently seen my talk

670
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:26,080
with sarah peters on dark reading i talk

671
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,199
quite a bit about

672
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,640
diversity without change

673
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,159
let me tell you let me give you the

674
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,480
example so if you've been listening

675
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,720
i've talked to you about the fact that i

676
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,840
was the only

677
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,080
black woman in every room

678
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,519
i was there so on the surface there was

679
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,200
no issue with race i mean i was their

680
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,960
first employee

681
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,159
no issues there but

682
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,760
as we added more people and they did not

683
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,120
look like me

684
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,799
and they had different frameworks and

685
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,279
different thoughts different experiences

686
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,320
they had cultural things in common

687
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,840
i felt less and less like i belonged

688
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,320
now not just because i didn't look like

689
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,480
everybody else

690
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,640
but because i was being excluded

691
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,360
and so diversity without inclusion

692
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,399
is diversity without change and

693
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,559
diversity without change

694
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,760
is a waste of everybody's time and it

695
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,600
creates harm to change agents like

696
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,559
myself

697
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,919
and other women it puts us in the

698
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:42,640
position

699
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,840
to put our physical self in harm in

700
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,000
order to make a change

701
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,200
and so what the game changer is for me

702
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,399
in this company is that i am

703
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,559
determined to create a platform for

704
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,799
women

705
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,640
who are seeking the opportunity to get

706
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,840
in up

707
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,279
and through cyber security

708
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,880
and i'm investing in friendships

709
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,720
lady friendships creating my lady tribe

710
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,039
and i'm leaning on them the times i get

711
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:15,840
burnt out

712
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,320
the times i get upset the times i feel

713
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,120
not heard

714
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,000
and i'm telling them what's going on and

715
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,039
getting advice from

716
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,640
smart women like ann johnson

717
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,679
i am calling gabby i

718
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,720
am texting kirsten i am

719
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,559
on the phone with amz these are women

720
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:37,679
who motivate and

721
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,279
inspire me but i might not have actually

722
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,559
created this

723
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,679
without having started my company so

724
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,440
it's been my game changer

725
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,399
it changed everything

726
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,720
the downside to that because every time

727
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,840
you make a decision

728
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,679
you choose not to do something else

729
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,240
every decision has a cost

730
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,679
the downside to that is

731
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,760
i spend a great deal of time

732
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,280
trying to provide

733
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,320
support and service and

734
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,000
demonstrate to the industry that as a

735
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,480
one of the rare gems of a black female

736
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,480
founder

737
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,440
that i can deliver high service that we

738
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,440
can deliver on time

739
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,399
that we deliver high quality that we are

740
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,719
the best that they'll ever meet

741
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,480
i spend a lot of time trying to figure

742
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,839
out ways to do that

743
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:39,040
and then i also have to train the new

744
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,760
young women young men minorities lgbtq

745
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,918
young men young men who are from

746
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,760
non-traditional careers

747
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,679
training them about the ways in which

748
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,440
people perceive them

749
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,560
so that they can have a fighting chance

750
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,920
to win in cyber security i have

751
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,440
effectively created a space

752
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,480
for people like me who just

753
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,359
need a chance

754
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,960
the point of this

755
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,480
conversation today is that

756
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,880
none of my obstacles have been easy to

757
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,800
overcome

758
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,200
not one of them was solved by another

759
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,560
person

760
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,960
it all required that i

761
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,040
know myself and that i choose

762
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,880
myself over anyone else every single

763
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,200
time

764
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,320
at my lowest point

765
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,599
i just wanted to quit

766
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,640
this whole industry i wanted to leave it

767
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,000
for them

768
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,920
leave it for the guys they can have this

769
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,119
i don't want it

770
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,720
i'll go back to being attorney think

771
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,320
about my my plan b is i'll go i'm going

772
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,920
to be an attorney like that's any better

773
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,400
like

774
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,400
like there's no uh diversity issues

775
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,599
there

776
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:09,520
but i just i just got so tired

777
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,839
of proving that i can do it

778
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,440
and then every time i decide i want to

779
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,640
give up

780
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:23,599
i am reminded reminded

781
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,839
of the people who came before me

782
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,400
what would have happened if john lewis

783
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,160
gave up

784
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,160
or harriet tubman my father

785
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,760
was the first black salutatorian

786
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,599
at cornell university he

787
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,200
has such bad memories

788
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,119
of america that when he was done with

789
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,960
his education he moved back and he has

790
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,960
not lived here since

791
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,200
i don't have that option

792
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,920
i have two children who look up to me

793
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,440
every single

794
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,800
day and it is for them

795
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,560
that i rise it is for the women

796
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,599
who just want a leg in

797
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,720
who no one can see

798
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,439
that i rise

799
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,599
it's for the quiet you know

800
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,960
mid-level woman who has all the

801
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,119
traits to rock this industry

802
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,640
but can't bring herself to ask for

803
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,359
the opportunity that i rise

804
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,960
i can't even tell you what it was i

805
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,480
wanted to talk to you about today it

806
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,640
wasn't this

807
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,920
i have experienced so many different

808
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,760
issues around gender

809
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,800
race bias this week alone

810
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,079
that it nearly it nearly

811
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,800
took me back

812
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,440
but i rise we all

813
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,880
have to rise

814
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,839
when i talk about the need to rise let

815
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,839
me let's talk about what rising means

816
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:25,040
women who rise

817
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,800
they don't ask they take

818
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,760
women who rise

819
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,560
they don't slouch they sit up

820
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,359
women who rise don't sit in the back of

821
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,440
a conference room the back of a bus

822
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,480
or the back of any room

823
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,680
they move to the front

824
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,240
women who rise are seen

825
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:03,040
and they are heard everywhere they are

826
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,960
whether they're having a good day a bad

827
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,839
day whether their hair is

828
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,599
doing what it should whether they don't

829
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,760
feel so good they rise

830
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,040
every day because they

831
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,520
are not the only ones who are impacted

832
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,440
when they don't

833
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,680
when we walk away when we give up

834
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,320
we are preventing the rise of so many

835
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,079
women we can't see behind us

836
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,520
and they need us to rise every day

837
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,359
they need us to give them hell every day

838
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,320
they need us to be unapologetic and

839
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,440
undeterred

840
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,960
by discomfort they need us to sit on

841
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,920
panels

842
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,240
boards sit on um sit in in in

843
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,920
meetings they need us to lead

844
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,160
discussions they need us to sit

845
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,960
in um as the ceo of companies security

846
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,520
companies

847
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,160
they need us to be invested in by uh

848
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,839
venture capitalists

849
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:03,280
they need us to be executives and if we

850
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,200
choose to be individual contributors

851
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:10,079
they need us to be best in class

852
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:15,040
because women we have always risen

853
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,480
i've lately been so disappointed in

854
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,400
conversations that i'm having with

855
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,319
male cisos they indicate to me an

856
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:28,000
interest strongly in hiring more of us

857
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,760
when i first started this conversation a

858
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,359
few years ago

859
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:34,000
i thought the issue was just that they

860
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,440
did not want to give us a chance

861
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,680
and that's still very true

862
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,440
but the truth is also that we are afraid

863
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,440
to stand

864
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,480
we turn down panels we say no to

865
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,760
research papers

866
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,480
we don't apply for positions we don't

867
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,720
respond to job requests

868
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,440
we don't submit for interviews we don't

869
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,359
follow up for interviews

870
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:05,359
we have come to a place where we expect

871
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,400
that people will chase us to give us

872
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,680
the job or the opportunity

873
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,440
but what is worth having is

874
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,319
always worth

875
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,839
the trouble we've got to extend

876
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:29,119
ourselves a little bit ladies

877
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,040
we've got to be okay asking for the

878
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,319
thing we know we want

879
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:36,880
but we don't think that we deserve we've

880
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,680
got to fight

881
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,880
our imposter syndrome we've got to

882
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,440
imposter syndrome has got to die let me

883
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,240
tell you ladies

884
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,800
my name is juliet and i have imposter

885
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,560
syndrome

886
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,280
you wouldn't know that by the way i talk

887
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,200
but i called two of my really best my

888
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,160
best friends from college and i

889
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,640
had you know an epiphany can you believe

890
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,359
i think i've got imposter syndrome

891
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,599
because i've wanted to start a podcast

892
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,560
i've been dying to you know do radio

893
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,119
i've been

894
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,200
wanting to you know do this big

895
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,640
marketing place but i'm like

896
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,280
oh i need to lose weight oh i need to

897
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:19,680
you know

898
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,119
once i get these pounds off once i

899
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,160
move to columbus once i get this

900
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,200
opportunity done and on and on

901
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,760
an excuse after excuse and none of it's

902
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,160
been done

903
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,599
i sat down one morning i couldn't sleep

904
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,720
and i said to myself why are you

905
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,000
struggling like this why won't you just

906
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,599
do it what do you need to hear to know

907
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,359
that you're capable of that you've seen

908
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,359
the most mediocre

909
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,598
men

910
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,800
step up and start something and they're

911
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,640
getting paid for

912
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,920
what you could put together and kill

913
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,640
but there is that part of my brain that

914
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,680
says

915
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,399
are you sure

916
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,720
what if

917
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,160
it may not be good see i'm somebody who

918
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,240
compartmentalizes so i can both

919
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,520
push through to get a client's work done

920
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,119
and know that i'll knock it off the roof

921
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,280
but when it's something that for me

922
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,680
i hedge i question

923
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,839
i add all kinds of doubt to myself

924
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:32,960
because

925
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,000
in my mind i

926
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,560
question whether i deserve it do i

927
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,440
deserve it

928
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,920
and i'm also afraid to commit if i

929
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,960
commit then i'm

930
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,640
in this thing and i can't get out of it

931
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,520
and one more thing

932
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,319
but the longer i take to make a decision

933
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:51,599
about something

934
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,640
the less of a shot i have

935
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,880
sure things pop up and i could be you

936
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,000
know someone could come to me and say we

937
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
want to pay you a gazillion dollars to

938
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,400
be

939
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,359
you know a podcast host that's that's

940
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:04,720
rather unlikely

941
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,839
that's that's that's like winning the

942
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:10,000
lotto and i stopped playing years ago

943
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,720
don't judge me

944
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,119
if i am not willing to put myself on the

945
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:18,000
line

946
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,960
for myself despite how uncomfortable i

947
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:21,839
feel

948
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:26,480
i will be doing myself this industry

949
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:31,599
my children and the people behind me

950
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:35,280
a really clear disservice

951
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,839
i have a voice and so do you

952
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,560
apply even if you're not sure you'll get

953
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,760
it

954
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,720
take the job

955
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:51,920
say yes first sit on panels

956
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,599
ask people for help you can ask men

957
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:58,160
well you know if they can help you men

958
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,760
you trust

959
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,240
do that

960
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,599
don't sit idly by because

961
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,839
we must rise

962
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:14,240
and when we rise we increase

963
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:18,720
representation for women in our field

964
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,560
we ensure opportunities for women

965
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:27,599
who are still yet to come

966
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:32,400
and we make room

967
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,359
in the industry for more of us for those

968
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,040
of us who are here to be seen

969
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,720
and heard so we must rise you must stand

970
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,040
up

971
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,839
it is not the time to sit back and be

972
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:45,040
idle

973
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,000
or to second guess if we're going to be

974
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,920
successful this is the time

975
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,119
the time is now this

976
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:56,000
is the revolution

977
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:01,200
and it's untelevised

978
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,319
i know how you feel

979
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,119
i just admitted to you i struggle with

980
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:08,720
the same

981
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,439
syndrome

982
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,079
but i'm fighting through it and so must

983
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,800
you you must fight

984
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,319
every day like your life depended on it

985
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:25,839
because it does the life you have today

986
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,240
will dictate the life you have tomorrow

987
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,040
therefore you must be planning today

988
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,000
for what you want next and you must be

989
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,079
using covid not as an excuse

990
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:41,680
not to move but as a reason to prepare

991
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,599
is giving us time with our families with

992
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:44,720
ourselves

993
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,880
away from the office with less

994
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,680
distractions

995
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,839
this is your time so anything in your

996
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:55,200
inbox that's a request

997
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,160
for something you've never done before

998
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,880
start by saying yes

999
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,599
give your requirements set your

1000
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,200
expectations

1001
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,560
tell them your limitations and

1002
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:11,839
boundaries but start by saying yes

1003
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,119
back in 2013 when i myself was on

1004
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,359
welfare

1005
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:22,960
i begged for the opportunity

1006
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,200
like i have today and every time

1007
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:32,640
i get you know down in my feelings

1008
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,319
i remind myself you wanted this this was

1009
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,880
what you wanted

1010
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,160
now you're going to make an excuse

1011
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,720
i don't have the ability to do that i

1012
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:45,839
owe god

1013
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:49,200
so much it doesn't even matter if you

1014
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,400
believe in god

1015
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:55,200
i owe myself so much my family

1016
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,599
my mother who was a who was also someone

1017
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:58,720
who raised us

1018
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:04,079
here alone for her sacrifice

1019
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:07,920
so i i beat myself up sometimes because

1020
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,520
i'm like this is what you wanted

1021
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:14,079
what's the problem here's the problem

1022
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:18,400
juliet you're too big you're too dark

1023
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,880
you're too loud you're not loud enough

1024
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,640
you work too hard you show off

1025
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,200
i don't really know you enough i spend a

1026
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,880
lot of time trying to figure out

1027
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,839
what it is that people want

1028
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,079
and most times i'm able to ignore it but

1029
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:39,760
there are some days where it's just

1030
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:44,559
too much i allow people to take up space

1031
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:45,760
in my head

1032
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,880
that don't belong there who

1033
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,720
are these they who are they

1034
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,400
why do they matter if they

1035
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,520
pay your bills maybe they matter but if

1036
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,119
they just have opinions

1037
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:02,720
that have nothing to do with bettering

1038
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,240
your life they

1039
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,200
don't matter

1040
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:11,040
i've created a space i hope to create

1041
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,319
spaces with summer view

1042
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:19,280
but we all have to continue to rise

1043
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,640
and i'll admit that there are times when

1044
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,960
i get so down in the dumps

1045
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,440
about some of the things that i'm facing

1046
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,319
and i want to

1047
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,920
run away i want to

1048
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,599
run but i don't

1049
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,839
one of the things that i do probably

1050
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:44,160
once a month

1051
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,280
is i will start to look for

1052
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,400
things that maya angelou

1053
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:55,599
has written she was so able to write

1054
00:49:55,599 --> 00:50:00,400
in in a way that people immediately got

1055
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,000
and that shakes me from this i'm scared

1056
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,359
mass that i find myself in every day

1057
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:10,880
so when i get down in the dumps

1058
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,160
i simply go to one of her poems and let

1059
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,839
me read you one of her poems

1060
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:18,559
and many of you have probably heard it

1061
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:21,760
it's called still i rise

1062
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,559
you may write me down in history with

1063
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,960
your bitter twisted lies

1064
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,760
you may trod me in the very dirt but

1065
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,559
still

1066
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:34,400
like dust i'll rise does my sassiness

1067
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,520
upset you

1068
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:38,160
why are you beset with gloom because i

1069
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:38,960
walk like

1070
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,599
i've got oil wells pumping in my living

1071
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:43,359
room

1072
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:46,480
just like moons and like suns

1073
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,200
with the certainty of tides just like

1074
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,200
hopes springing high

1075
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,880
still i'll rise did you want to see me

1076
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:55,920
broken

1077
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,040
bowed head and lowered eyes shoulders

1078
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,119
falling down like tear drops

1079
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:04,400
weakened by my soulful cries

1080
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,040
does my heartiness offend you don't you

1081
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,720
take it awful hard

1082
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,200
cause i laugh like i've got gold mines

1083
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,240
digging in my

1084
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,680
own backyard you may shoot me with your

1085
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:16,480
words

1086
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,800
and you may cut me with your eyes you

1087
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,720
may kill me with your hatefulness

1088
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,720
but still like air i'll rise

1089
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,760
does my sexiness upset you does it come

1090
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,559
as a surprise that i dance like i've got

1091
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:33,359
diamonds at the meeting of my thighs

1092
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:36,079
out of the huts of history's shame i

1093
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:37,200
rise

1094
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,319
up from a past that's rooted in pain

1095
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:44,000
i rise i'm a black ocean leaping and

1096
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:44,640
wide

1097
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:49,599
welling and swelling i bear in the tide

1098
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:52,400
leaving behind nights of terror and fear

1099
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,680
i rise

1100
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,400
into a daybreak that's wondrously clear

1101
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,440
i rise

1102
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,440
bringing the gifts that my ancestors

1103
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,559
gave

1104
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:04,800
i am the dream in the hope

1105
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,119
of a slave i rise

1106
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:12,480
i rise i

1107
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,880
rise

1108
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,240
that is one of the most beautiful

1109
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,400
poems because it gives me goosebumps

1110
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,319
when i remember what our ancestors

1111
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:31,839
gave up for us to be here today

1112
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:36,559
susan b anthony did how harriet tubman

1113
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:38,960
you know created the underground

1114
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,800
railroad

1115
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,440
all the way to you know politicians like

1116
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:44,319
we know today

1117
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:47,440
celebrities that have beat all odds

1118
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,000
and the every working man and woman who

1119
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:50,640
wake up

1120
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,800
every day and rise despite

1121
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,880
all the turmoil pain and poverty

1122
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,800
i rise because they rise i rise because

1123
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,000
you rise

1124
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,119
we have to rise

1125
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,480
and i won't even fool you

1126
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,760
into thinking that what i'm asking you

1127
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:14,240
to do

1128
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,839
every day is easy i won't do that

1129
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:20,559
what i'll tell you is that it'll cost

1130
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:20,880
you

1131
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:25,359
lots of things you may not be able

1132
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:27,040
to do the fun things that your friends

1133
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,200
can do you may not

1134
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,760
be able to hang out with the people you

1135
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,040
used to

1136
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,480
you may not be able to put your kids to

1137
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,440
bed sometimes

1138
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:44,240
but sometimes you will rise

1139
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,200
and it will cost you but if you

1140
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,359
determine that it's worth it you will do

1141
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:50,079
it

1142
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:54,240
and i ask you and employ you to do it

1143
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,200
we all like air must rise

1144
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:04,000
we must fill the space of the industry

1145
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,520
up and around

1146
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,960
we must break ceilings to create space

1147
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,680
we must break barriers to create space

1148
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,559
we must

1149
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:18,160
respect and demand our boundaries be met

1150
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:22,800
to make our space safe

1151
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,839
but we must rise

1152
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:30,319
whether they like it or not

1153
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:34,720
we must shed our likability complex

1154
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,960
because i'm a woman doesn't mean my goal

1155
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,720
is to be likable

1156
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,359
you either like me or you don't and i'm

1157
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:41,839
now

1158
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:45,280
okay with that there are people

1159
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,680
who will be drawn to me and that i will

1160
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,280
be drawn to

1161
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,880
and there will be others that i need to

1162
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,799
shed

1163
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:55,839
i am okay shedding those who

1164
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:58,960
no longer serve me i

1165
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:03,359
no longer put my likability first

1166
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:08,480
either love me or leave me alone

1167
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,520
long term we've been conditioned over

1168
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,400
time

1169
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,200
to be well liked when what we should

1170
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,160
really be is respected

1171
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,079
we've been taught that we have to be

1172
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:23,520
nice

1173
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:27,359
when really we should be paid

1174
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:29,599
we no longer have to sacrifice ourselves

1175
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:30,400
ladies

1176
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,720
in order to get the things that we want

1177
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:38,319
we can have both our dreams met

1178
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:41,359
and the man of our dreams or

1179
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:45,119
the house down the road

1180
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:48,640
or the woman who we love we have the

1181
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:49,119
right

1182
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:52,559
to choose but i'm asking you

1183
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:56,160
to choose to rise despite

1184
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,680
all else because in rising we take up

1185
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,799
space

1186
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:04,319
and space taking up space

1187
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,720
is change it's action it's movement it's

1188
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,960
motion

1189
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:13,920
it's disruptive change

1190
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,520
makes things different it disrupts the

1191
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,520
status quo

1192
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,839
every time you rise you take up more

1193
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:23,200
space

1194
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,760
people just have to move over to make

1195
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:26,880
room for you

1196
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,079
and we're not going to ask no we're not

1197
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:31,760
going to ask

1198
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,040
we're going to demand

1199
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:41,440
learn to sit in your discomfort

1200
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,880
rising when i rise

1201
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,640
someone must fall and i'll admit

1202
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,040
i'd never wanted to be my sisters my

1203
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,480
friends

1204
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,960
my family my community

1205
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:00,880
but i'm going to be honest about first

1206
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,799
not making it my responsibility to make

1207
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:04,240
sure people don't fall over

1208
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,680
fall out fall in fall off that's not

1209
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,799
my responsibility as a woman i am a

1210
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:12,960
nurturer to children

1211
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,920
i'm a nurturer to my partner i do not

1212
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,839
have to nurture the feelings of

1213
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:20,319
sensitive men that's just not what i'm

1214
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:21,920
here for

1215
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,359
you have to sit in the discomfort

1216
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:26,160
because

1217
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:29,040
it will come from all directions every

1218
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,319
day and the goal

1219
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:33,359
is to push you aside the goal is to

1220
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:34,079
reclaim

1221
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:37,200
space if you start to see it as

1222
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,400
your space or their space you'll start

1223
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,079
to understand what i'm saying

1224
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:44,319
you must rise you must be proud and

1225
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:45,359
strong

1226
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:49,599
you must not give up in every day

1227
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:54,400
you have to start again

1228
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,640
take another risk apply for a new job

1229
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:02,160
lead the project you have to keep

1230
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:05,599
rising and pushing and making your space

1231
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:07,680
in this industry because

1232
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,160
i find that we have these great fits and

1233
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,920
starts forward

1234
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,119
and then all of a sudden because we're

1235
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:16,559
in a microcosm of the

1236
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:20,839
of the society we live in we get pushed

1237
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:23,760
back

1238
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:28,960
and that is the natural order of things

1239
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,200
like when someone is trying to make a

1240
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,400
change

1241
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,680
make a major change lose weight um

1242
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,599
they're looking to stop you know bad

1243
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:39,359
habits

1244
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:42,240
it is easier to continue to do what

1245
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,680
you're doing

1246
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,520
to keep things the way they are and so

1247
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,880
naturally

1248
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,200
the industry we're in is predisposed to

1249
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,000
being the way it

1250
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,559
is in order for it to change we've

1251
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:55,119
actually got to force it

1252
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:57,119
we can't sit down and allow things to

1253
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:58,799
happen around us we've got to be the

1254
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:05,040
change makers

1255
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:09,200
this is our time in cyber

1256
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,880
this is the time for women and

1257
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,480
minorities in cyber

1258
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,680
in lgbtq and

1259
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,319
even veterans and those who are um

1260
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:21,520
disabled

1261
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,880
those who are new who um who have

1262
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:28,319
neurodiverse um frameworks

1263
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:32,559
and i and i'm one of those this is our

1264
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:34,960
time

1265
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:36,799
but i'll tell you we have to do it with

1266
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:38,480
the full community

1267
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,440
and men are people too in fact all of my

1268
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:42,880
opportunities in cyber have come from

1269
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,880
men

1270
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,160
so i i implore you not to take this as a

1271
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,359
male bashing

1272
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:51,440
session it's about loving yourself

1273
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,640
enough to ask

1274
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,799
for what you want and not to allow

1275
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,400
anyone to step into your space and

1276
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,960
ladies i mean this

1277
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,440
physically violating you inappropriate

1278
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,319
touching

1279
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:05,440
inappropriate comments making you feel

1280
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,200
uncomfortable in your own skin

1281
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,599
or making you feel like you can't look

1282
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:13,200
good because someone else can't take it

1283
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,559
when we rise we look good doing it and

1284
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:19,680
they'll just have to accept it

1285
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,920
and if you find that they cannot accept

1286
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,119
it

1287
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:26,079
if you find that the people who you're

1288
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:27,280
talking to

1289
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,319
are unable to handle

1290
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:33,599
you and your

1291
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:36,240
badass

1292
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,799
if they cannot stand

1293
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:43,760
your beauty or you make them feel like

1294
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,480
less than a man

1295
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,920
or you're working with a woman who's

1296
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,480
challenging you or being

1297
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:54,240
someone who is not your supporter

1298
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,799
i'm going to tell you one phrase that

1299
01:00:56,799 --> 01:00:58,880
i've heard recently that i think plays

1300
01:00:58,880 --> 01:00:59,200
in

1301
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:03,598
any situation that i just mentioned

1302
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:08,160
men have a wonderful way

1303
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,720
of not letting things bother them it

1304
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,920
rolls off of them so easily

1305
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,839
and one of the phrases that i heard

1306
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:17,440
recently

1307
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,119
when i get frustrated or someone said

1308
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:20,559
something that they want me to be upset

1309
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:23,040
about but i'm not

1310
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:26,319
i'm going to teach it to you today when

1311
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:28,799
some man makes you feel like you don't

1312
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:30,000
deserve it

1313
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,799
or some opportunity comes up and there's

1314
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,920
competition

1315
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,599
and you're afraid that you might hurt

1316
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:37,599
somebody else

1317
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:40,880
i want you to sit up

1318
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,079
look around and then look directly at

1319
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:46,559
the person

1320
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,680
and let them know

1321
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,839
it is what it is

1322
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:00,240
never lose your space

1323
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:05,760
because spaces create places

1324
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:09,839
and places are where you belong

1325
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:12,880
and you belong here we

1326
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:18,000
belong here and so keep rising

1327
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,319
thank you so much for your time i'm so

1328
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:21,760
glad you could come with me into my

1329
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:22,720
household
