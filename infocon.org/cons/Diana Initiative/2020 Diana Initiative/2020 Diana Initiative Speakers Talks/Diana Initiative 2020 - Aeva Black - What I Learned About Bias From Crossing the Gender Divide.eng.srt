please welcome ava black

34
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,720
hey folks um well i wasn't in for myself

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,280
but

36
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,360
josh did a great job of that um it's

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,119
easier for me to talk about tech that's

38
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,799
usually what i do in conferences but

39
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,880
today i'm gonna be a bit more

40
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,159
a bit more vulnerable and talk about

41
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,640
myself um i wish i didn't feel the need

42
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,560
to talk about gender discrimination or

43
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,840
trans issues in 2020 but i kind of do

44
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,159
like like a lot of other folks yesterday

45
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,520
and today have already talked about

46
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,360
diversity and inclusion and company

47
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,280
diverse and inclusive companies

48
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,000
just perform better so the original

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,439
title you can see

50
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,960
but i kind of changed it a bit this

51
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,880
talk's really more of a personal story

52
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,159
and journey

53
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,960
so i hope that through the experience of

54
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,560
seeing me a little bit more

55
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,119
you learn to see other people um and

56
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,320
have more compassion and

57
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,080
that compassion helps you she helps

58
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,679
treat the technology you

59
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,640
and the companies you work in build now

60
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:12,959
this

61
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,720
this talk could start anywhere in my

62
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,160
life but i want to give you a little

63
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,680
extra background on me

64
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,319
um so if i don't talk about too much my

65
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,000
early childhood was spent in indian

66
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,800
communities

67
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,640
my first exposure to american culture

68
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,239
was second grade

69
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,560
and i really didn't fit in in uh in

70
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,520
today's terms

71
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,040
i probably would have been labeled

72
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,879
neurodivergent and genderqueer

73
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,319
instead of all the other labels that

74
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,599
were used back in the in the 80s

75
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,519
so i went through primary and secondary

76
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,160
secondary school as fast as i could

77
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,480
i was um lucky enough to get through

78
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,000
college pretty quick and jump into a

79
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,040
startup

80
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,840
uh the first during the first.com bubble

81
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,440
i was still a teenager

82
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,160
a long-haired eyeliner wearing goth who

83
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,239
kept odd hours and wrote angsty poetry

84
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,239
and i loved linux back in the 90s

85
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,840
when i really didn't fit in in the tech

86
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,760
industry back then

87
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,360
i bounced through some startups and back

88
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,360
to university and back to startups and

89
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,440
then eventually i fled california

90
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,599
and really um so in 2011 i was kind of

91
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,640
living off grid

92
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,319
doing database consulting and a friend

93
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,280
convinced me to go to burning man

94
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,680
if you've never been it is exactly as

95
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,560
hedonistic as you might have heard

96
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,920
disproportionately filled with tech bros

97
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,000
who party without a care in the world

98
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,799
it's also completely different from that

99
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,080
it can be a safe space for vulnerable

100
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,920
self-discovery for a lot of people full

101
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,599
of compassion and self-expression and

102
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,799
beautiful art

103
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,879
where queer and trans folk find a safe

104
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,400
space unlike anything in

105
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,120
the default world it is all of that and

106
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,560
ironically it's where i learned how to

107
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,680
act like a tech bro

108
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,599
the burn gave me a chance to learn about

109
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,200
a culture i had never felt safe in

110
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,840
growing up

111
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,879
men arguing with each other i learned

112
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,640
that if i spoke over others my point

113
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,840
would be heard

114
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,680
if i used rhetoric i could convince the

115
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,280
whole group that i was right

116
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,200
and if i kept showing up and i kept

117
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,040
stating my opinion

118
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,400
sooner or later there wouldn't be any

119
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,080
opposition left

120
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,159
and i learned how leadership can emerge

121
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,080
from open conflicts

122
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,680
you just need to be perceived by the

123
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,120
group as somebody important

124
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,798
someone the current leaders are willing

125
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,639
to treat with respect

126
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,079
and then your opinion carries more

127
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,160
weight now to be clear

128
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,040
i think these are toxic norms they don't

129
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,000
represent the ideals of burning man

130
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,960
nor do they represent my ideals but for

131
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,400
a couple years i thought this was just

132
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,359
how business gets done

133
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,680
and i came back from the burn with a

134
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,720
completely different approach to work

135
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,240
within a year i started a new open

136
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,400
source project i was flying all over the

137
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,360
world

138
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,040
talking at conferences partying with

139
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,199
customers meeting clients

140
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,320
it's like i had just found easy mode and

141
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,680
i got promoted

142
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,680
and i got promoted again and then two

143
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,040
years later i was up for another

144
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,080
promotion

145
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,080
and instead of staying there i spun out

146
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,280
to a startup

147
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,199
um someone offered me the role of vp

148
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,479
running the whole like the whole

149
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,759
engineering wing

150
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,039
in hindsight i was really unqualified

151
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,720
but as is typical for someone who was

152
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,160
perceived as a man

153
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,759
i was hired based on what someone

154
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,520
thought i could do even though i'd never

155
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,280
done it before

156
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,080
and so in those five years my income

157
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,840
more than doubled

158
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,360
but i didn't really stop i was flying

159
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,199
flying everywhere too much i didn't stop

160
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,440
to think about this but i began to track

161
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,199
little discrepancies how differently men

162
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,880
would respond to my emails before and

163
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,199
after they heard my voice on a phone

164
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,120
because to most americans my name back

165
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,000
then even back then it was feminine

166
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
so while i was vp of engineering my ceo

167
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
tasked me with building an unbiased

168
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,520
hiring process you wanted to double the

169
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,479
team size

170
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,840
you want me to follow the google play

171
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,639
book

172
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,479
i'll give you a brief rundown on what

173
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,240
this looks like if you're not familiar

174
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,280
with it but chances are if you've

175
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,400
interviewed anywhere

176
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
in silicon valley or the tech industry

177
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,080
in the past five years you've probably

178
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,759
run into this process

179
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,639
from the outside from the inside the way

180
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,680
it works is that

181
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,199
someone receives a resume removes the

182
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,720
name removes gender markers

183
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,960
and sort of scrubs anything that might

184
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,400
be identifiable

185
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,880
and coordinates the interviews the

186
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,639
actual interviewers

187
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,720
then write up written reports which are

188
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,000
again scrubbed

189
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,080
of identifiers all those reports are

190
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,919
collated along with scores and metrics

191
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,600
and passed on to a committee

192
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,160
who never meets the candidate and just

193
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,880
judges off

194
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,120
these reports and makes a decision

195
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,800
proponents of this approach claim

196
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,880
that decision is not biased but i will

197
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,560
tell you it is

198
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,800
the unconscious bias is hiding in plain

199
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,080
sight in every step

200
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,120
of that process there's bias when the

201
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,039
applicant writes their cv there's bias

202
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,160
when the screener

203
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,759
reads it and subtle aspects of language

204
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,880
and word choice or schools you went to

205
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,199
prioritize or inform that person's

206
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,560
prioritization

207
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,720
there's bias whenever any interviewer

208
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,840
hears a voice

209
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,199
or sees a face on zoom and all the work

210
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,960
that companies are busy doing

211
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,080
i'm sorry to say it it just hides the

212
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,280
bias in the system

213
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,840
it doesn't remove it and going through

214
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,199
this process

215
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,440
even as my ceo overruled my objections

216
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,360
it really required me to learn to see

217
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,840
the biases each of my employees had

218
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,080
so that i could compensate for it when

219
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,319
making those hiring decisions

220
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,560
and it really forced me to analyze my

221
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,319
own biases

222
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,800
and so there i was studying bias and

223
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,400
hiring and studying bias in machine

224
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,280
learning

225
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,720
and re-evaluating a year of my own

226
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,400
management decisions

227
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,319
and at the same time noticing how my

228
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,560
list of queer friends my community had

229
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,479
kind of shrunk

230
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,800
and i realized one day that even my own

231
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,840
primary partner

232
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,319
thought of me as a man and like manly

233
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,440
man

234
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,560
and sure i lived on a farm but

235
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,840
that didn't define my gender and i

236
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,199
chopped wood and that didn't define my

237
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,639
gender

238
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,360
and yet i began to to really

239
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,160
think more deeply about how gender is

240
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,840
this intersection

241
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,160
and how bias plays into it and the more

242
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,680
i looked in the mirror of my community

243
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,199
the more i realized the lens i was

244
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,800
seeing through and the lens i was seen

245
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,479
through neither one of them

246
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,599
reflected me nor was the impact i was

247
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,560
having

248
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,919
the impact i wanted to have you see at

249
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:30,479
work

250
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,559
i was meeting with execs from companies

251
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,559
in south america and middle east markets

252
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,919
where the company found the right

253
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,200
product fit

254
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,519
i could see every day how those

255
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,440
executives talked about women and i knew

256
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,399
if i came out

257
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,959
i couldn't do that job anymore i had to

258
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,518
make a choice

259
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,600
so i came out to my friends for my

260
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,560
birthday what was he gonna do

261
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,480
everyone was awesome and supportive and

262
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,120
you know one one partner gave me a tiara

263
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,600
everyone gave me some beautiful jewelry

264
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,920
um the best birthday gift was

265
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,000
the welcoming support from all of my

266
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
friends

267
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,839
but after that party i had to put on boy

268
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,279
clothes again and get back on a plane

269
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,720
and go fight with my ceo because

270
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,640
passionate debate is how business gets

271
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,080
done for some people um

272
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,839
i knew that i had to leave that company

273
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,519
it just took a little bit of time

274
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,200
and i i told myself i'll just take six

275
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,959
months off but let's be real i burned

276
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:23,839
out

277
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,240
i walked away with no idea whether i

278
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,080
want to or even be able to get back into

279
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,320
tech

280
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,000
let's pause for a moment now and smell

281
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,519
the roses because this talk

282
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,040
gets a little bit dark and it's about to

283
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,880
get kind of darker i want to talk about

284
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,320
what i've learned about bias

285
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,680
through that process and then in the

286
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,279
window of a sabbatical for a while

287
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,880
i did a lot of self-reflection and

288
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,959
therapy and naval gazing on questions

289
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,880
like why is my favorite color red

290
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,560
might seem totally irrelevant but bear

291
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,720
with me for another minute it's not

292
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,160
i was told as a kid that i was

293
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,000
colorblind

294
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,519
it's not that simple it's about 10

295
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,440
percent of the world is labeled as

296
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,519
colorblind but there's actually a whole

297
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,800
subclasses

298
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,600
um more than ten of them for different

299
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,200
variations of this

300
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,880
um different variations in the color

301
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,800
cones in our eyes people have a little

302
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,079
different reception

303
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,240
on their blue red or green or they have

304
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,920
none of one of those or they have extra

305
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,320
for me i just don't see red as much as

306
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,920
everybody else

307
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,240
the colors are shifted quite literally

308
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,320
my perception of the world is biased

309
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,560
because it deviates from the norm

310
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,560
and as i thought about this i thought

311
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,560
what about imagination and memory like i

312
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,160
perceive these two

313
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,480
without getting yet into the structural

314
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,240
or chemical differences between brains i

315
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,720
thought

316
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,480
well what's in there is just a garbled

317
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,000
pile of my own experiences but

318
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,800
somehow all of those memories affect my

319
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,600
judgment of everybody i meet today

320
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
we call this learning when it is

321
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,040
explicit or bias

322
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,760
when it's implicit and there's a real

323
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,200
time connection

324
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,399
between our physical senses our memories

325
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,560
and our impressions of people when i

326
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,720
imagine a rose it doesn't bring up

327
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,680
the smell or the memory of my

328
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,240
grandmother

329
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,000
but whenever i smell a rose it always

330
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,839
does

331
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,800
and that momentary flashback is going to

332
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,160
impact

333
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,120
my perception my impression of a moment

334
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,200
in time or a person who's wearing

335
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,720
rose scented perfume so our experience

336
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,480
of the physical world is completely

337
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,640
unique because it is

338
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,439
mediated by our own past

339
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,440
and i mentioned chemical state but

340
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,720
there's so much more going on in the

341
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,440
body

342
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,519
and i don't know i'm not always good at

343
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,200
eating sometimes i forget to eat

344
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,640
breakfast or lunch and

345
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,880
in the afternoon afternoon every email

346
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,800
i'm getting just seems kind of snarky

347
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,200
and my responses are definitely snarky

348
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,000
um

349
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,519
and more than like i'm gonna eat lunch

350
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,880
and i'll come back and and look at the

351
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,320
same email and i've learned not to send

352
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,920
my responses right away

353
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,839
um you ever do that you realize that

354
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,079
like it's it's really just my body

355
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,639
kind of making me grumpy right now so

356
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,639
more than just how i respond it actually

357
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,959
affects how i perceive the world

358
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,360
i'm walking by a rose and i'm upset or

359
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,200
hungry that rose isn't going to smell as

360
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,120
good

361
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,440
if i'm sad it might smell stronger so

362
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,000
all of this

363
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,519
all of this together is what i would

364
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,440
call perception or perception bias it's

365
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,720
the sum of our of

366
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,959
the actual sensory input which is unique

367
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,680
mediated by the state of our body

368
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,000
combined with whatever memories we have

369
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,440
in this framework by the way it isn't

370
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,279
new i just revisited

371
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,399
it while i was taking this this break

372
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,639
it was introduced to me as a kid through

373
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,000
meditation

374
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,920
and i kept coming back to this teaching

375
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,920
and during my during my break

376
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,000
the act of meditation is just the act of

377
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,600
observing our thoughts as they come in

378
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,720
as they go

379
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,839
being patient about it and

380
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,519
not getting attached to not getting sort

381
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,959
of caught up in those thoughts

382
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,399
the actual mechanism it works

383
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,040
to decrease the the coloring the impact

384
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,000
of our thoughts

385
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,480
on our perceptions just by observing

386
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,600
them

387
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,000
now sitting on a cushion is not the same

388
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,360
thing as meditation that's just where we

389
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,639
go to practice

390
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,839
to train our mental muscle it's kind of

391
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:26,639
like a gym

392
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,040
like you go to the gym to lift weights

393
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,560
you sit on a cushion to work out your

394
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,639
brain

395
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,720
and if meditation is increasing your

396
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,880
anxiety change it up slow it down

397
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,880
ask for help right if you're going to

398
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,320
the gym and it hurt you'd ask for a

399
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,079
physical trainer to give you tips on

400
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,680
your posture

401
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,320
do the same thing with your brain

402
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,959
so about a year after i left that role

403
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,079
and and came out

404
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,320
uh i started looking for work in the

405
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,160
tech industry again i'm like i'll try it

406
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,240
again

407
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,320
and i i thought by this point in my

408
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,079
career i should be passed all of that

409
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,480
exam by whiteboard theater

410
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,839
but i turned out i wasn't um i was asked

411
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,240
over and over again to pass

412
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,120
these sort of panel whiteboard exams by

413
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,160
old white men

414
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,240
and i say old white men not to

415
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,279
categorize

416
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,120
people in a negative way but draw

417
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,880
attention to a divide that i suddenly

418
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,680
found myself on the other side of

419
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,639
gender shouldn't matter but it does um

420
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,440
and it is

421
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,959
only through recognizing that we're

422
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,638
going to be able to improve things

423
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,000
i was suddenly really aware in a way i

424
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,360
had never been before

425
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,360
because i was aware that they were aware

426
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,800
and that they were uncertain of what to

427
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,880
do about that

428
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,279
i would inevitably be ushered to the one

429
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,800
single occupant bathroom

430
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,480
somewhere on campus far away from where

431
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,639
my interviews were happening

432
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,480
because they didn't know how to ask or

433
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,519
want to usher me to a

434
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,279
gen to a gendered bathroom

435
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,760
and i was

436
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,079
there's a type of bias called stereotype

437
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,720
threat that is the fear of reinforcing

438
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,399
whatever biases someone else might have

439
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,839
about us

440
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,199
since i couldn't know what bias they

441
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,399
might have had but it was obvious that

442
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,800
they were having some experience

443
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,360
my anxiety just filled in that gap and

444
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,040
things got rough for a while

445
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,880
so i'm going to warn you all the next

446
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,160
couple of minutes of this talk

447
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,079
might get a little bit extra rough and

448
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,440
then it'll get happy again i promise

449
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,680
there was a happy ending

450
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,240
um if you don't want to hear the actual

451
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,759
stories that i faced from some of these

452
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,040
tech companies

453
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,360
go ahead and mute i'll do a little wave

454
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,639
uh when i'm done and you'll see some

455
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,360
happy slides

456
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,160
a photo of deathcon um which i wish we

457
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,079
were all at this year but uh

458
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,839
yeah and so

459
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,440
oh yeah and names of companies and

460
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,199
people are scrubbed from all of this

461
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,240
um one uh one one colleague that i'd

462
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,360
worked with right just

463
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,360
like he was really excited that i'm hey

464
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,720
you know you're back in tech it's so

465
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,680
good to hear from you

466
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,680
we talked on the phone for an hour it

467
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,880
was super clear that

468
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,440
i could help his team grow and i knew

469
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,519
the tech they were using inside and out

470
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,720
the call ended with a really

471
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,160
enthusiastic yeah a recruiter's gonna

472
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,440
reach out to you right away

473
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,639
and i could tell they pulled up my

474
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,120
linkedin i'd already changed

475
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,160
uh details up there and suddenly a week

476
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,800
went by

477
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,839
and i checked in and i got a

478
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,600
cold email it's cool i just got a

479
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,040
time check i thought this was a 30

480
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,600
minute slot um let me skip through some

481
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,399
of these

482
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,560
to get to the points because this kind

483
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,160
of goes on for a while

484
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,880
four companies gave me um a sort of

485
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,120
really weird

486
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,480
uh pushback

487
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,880
and then one company i got kind of

488
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,800
grumpy after a year

489
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,600
of this um and about 30 companies and

490
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:51,920
one

491
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,680
one manager actually brought me in

492
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,040
afterwards and said look i really want

493
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,199
to hire you we need your talent

494
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,480
but i don't know how to hire someone

495
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,399
like you so

496
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,800
what changed right i am just as skilled

497
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,319
as i ever was

498
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,679
um i like to think i'm more

499
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,319
compassionate than i used to be

500
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,400
um but obviously the way people perceive

501
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,880
me has changed

502
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,799
but along the way i learned so much more

503
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,119
about myself and about infosec and i

504
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,160
wouldn't have had the chance to go to

505
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,480
defcon if not for this rather extended

506
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,280
break

507
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,280
um i landed a job at microsoft or now

508
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,959
running an open source project

509
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,480
but the real point i want to get to in

510
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,240
the last few minutes is

511
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,880
the internal changes i realized my own

512
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,000
perception of bias was

513
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,160
changing the more negative experiences i

514
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,120
had

515
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,240
the more i expected to have them now i

516
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,799
have to intentionally counter that bias

517
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,200
and also my hormones changed everything

518
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,480
everything got richer sounds became

519
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,559
deeper my imagination got clearer i

520
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:50,880
think

521
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,360
better i still see colors the same way

522
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,440
unfortunately and i kind of like it

523
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,120
um but flowers when i walk on the street

524
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,480
bring back different memories

525
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,280
it's really interesting how much that

526
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,039
changes

527
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,400
and how much i reconnected with an

528
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,480
internal sense of self that i've been

529
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,320
missing for

530
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,160
15 years and only my experience

531
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,320
i'm not suggesting it's universally true

532
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,320
but damn estrogen has been the best

533
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,640
antidepressant i've ever taken

534
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,480
it's not medical advice hormones are not

535
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,760
able

536
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,559
um but i'm starting looking into this

537
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:26,960
and i'm

538
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,080
to skip some of this because

539
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,679
i'm running low on time i thought i had

540
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:32,990
more time

541
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,059
[Music]

542
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,120
we are as a society still learning so

543
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,280
much about how

544
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,080
diverse our bodies are beyond a simple

545
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,080
gender binary

546
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,360
this chart was published about three

547
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,840
years ago in scientific american

548
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,840
represents some of the many pathways by

549
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,080
which biology develops not just along

550
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,559
binary lines about

551
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,559
one to three percent of the world's

552
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,039
population falls in the middle here

553
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,320
and how does this all relate to

554
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,879
technology

555
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,080
machine learning is fairly easy there

556
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,880
are quotes there

557
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,240
um creating a model that reproduces the

558
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,520
bias present in

559
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,000
current social economic or criminal

560
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,679
justice systems is really not hard you

561
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,280
feed in historical data

562
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,960
you get back out the bias the system

563
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,080
already had what is really hard

564
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,120
is not reproducing epistemic violence

565
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,760
against marginalized groups and that

566
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,120
work begins in our own heart

567
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,880
it starts by becoming familiar with the

568
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,960
edges of your own comfort zone

569
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,039
learning about other cultures other

570
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,400
people other way of life

571
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,039
learning to value those differences you

572
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,480
have to see them first to be able to

573
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,240
value them

574
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,080
learning to value the diversity in human

575
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,640
biology as our strength

576
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,400
my advice would be if you can go live in

577
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,679
a different culture you don't have to

578
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,200
move to a different country that's one

579
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,000
example

580
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,520
you can find other cultures in your own

581
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,360
city

582
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,320
by by living in one and embracing it for

583
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,600
a little while you can

584
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,600
look back and see your own culture

585
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,799
differently

586
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,559
and learn to see that delta it was part

587
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,120
of your bias before

588
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,400
and if you can kind of recommend it for

589
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:14,799
everybody

590
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,559
practice meditation you don't need to

591
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,799
find a quiet mountaintop to sit on

592
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,240
over time you learn to build a quiet

593
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,159
place inside yourself

594
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,880
find a tradition or a teacher or anybody

595
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,679
[Music]

596
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,039
and stick with it it is not easy to see

597
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,400
yourself

598
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,720
clearly and to understand your own

599
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,760
biases but it is

600
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,480
worth it it is the only way we improve

601
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,320
this society and make our companies more

602
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,200
inclusive

603
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,039
thank you so if there's still time

604
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,159
i'll take some questions otherwise you

605
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,120
can find me online ava thank you so much

606
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,880
for that talk that was excellent

607
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,120
um uh we have time for one quick

608
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,720
question um and red

609
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,360
asks how do you remove your own bias

610
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,480
when interviewing candidates

611
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,520
the unfortunate answer is you can't

612
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,720
we all are biased all of us all the time

613
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,720
it is inherent in being human

614
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,840
but by becoming directly aware of

615
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,880
my bias that is to say how my judgment

616
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,640
is different than the norm or different

617
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,559
than yours different than other people

618
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,400
on my team

619
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,039
i can do my best to compensate for it so

620
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,320
we can build

621
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,840
review panels that are inclusive and

622
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,080
welcoming and talk about that bias well

623
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,360
i don't know enough

624
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,440
to judge that does someone else here

625
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,919
know enough

626
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,720
for sure getting getting feedback from

627
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,480
other people having other voices that

628
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,400
yeah i yeah thank you great

629
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,760
thank you so much for speaking again

630
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,200
let's have a virtual round of applause

631
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,760
for ava

632
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,480
and with that uh i will be signing off

633
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,840
see you all next time
