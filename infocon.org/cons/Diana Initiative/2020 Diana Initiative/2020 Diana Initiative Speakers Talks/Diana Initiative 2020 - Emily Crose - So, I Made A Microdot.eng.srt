uh right into the talk so very quickly

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,840
uh thanks again to our sponsors without

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,519
these sponsors this doesn't happen

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,519
uh so be sure to stop by the expo hall

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,560
and say hi to them

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,320
maybe your only chance to be face to

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,840
face with some of these folks during a

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,000
pandemic of course

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,680
and a quick program note so we're

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,440
delaying the closing keynote by half

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,960
hour today just in order to give

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,559
all the tracks and sessions time to

19
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,640
finish up so that everyone can attend

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,760
the closing keynote

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,000
so that'll be uh gatekeeping gaslighting

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,120
and grieving

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,000
uh given by kirsten breaker it's at 4 30

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,280
pacific time

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,879
cam on the main stage stage one in there

26
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,640
and now i'm thrilled to introduce uh

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,320
emily and lacrosse to take us through a

28
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,160
deep dive into spycraft and walk us

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,760
through how to make a micro dot

30
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,438
emily's been in information security for

31
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,520
over 10 years previously she's worked

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,560
with cia

33
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,520
nsa us army intercom in her free time

34
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,520
she runs the hacking history project

35
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,759
and co-authors and teletypist take it

36
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:16,560
away emily

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,360
thanks hi everyone thanks for coming to

38
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,000
my talk

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,360
so today i'm going to be giving you a

40
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,759
talk on how to make micro dots

41
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,880
um so i've titled this so i made a micro

42
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,400
dot

43
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,560
uh so let's get into who i am just to

44
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,040
start with uh my name is emily cross

45
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,040
i'm a senior industrial pen tester at

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,280
dragos incorporated we

47
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,520
do industrial pen testing in the

48
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,960
evenings i just

49
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,079
wreak havoc on things my twitter is

50
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:44,399
there

51
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,439
at hexadecimate and if you are looking

52
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,119
for me on linkedin please don't don't

53
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,000
try and find me

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,320
um okay so a table of contents just to

55
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,840
give you an overview of what we're gonna

56
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,040
be talking about

57
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,600
um so in the first this is gonna be

58
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,880
divided up into three parts there's

59
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,520
gonna be

60
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,320
a part about history um kind of like the

61
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,320
what is of a micro dot

62
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,840
the second part is going to be micro dot

63
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,520
production how we actually

64
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,840
create the micro dot um and then the

65
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,440
third part is modern use

66
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,319
so why why are we doing this and why

67
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,120
would it be

68
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,840
useful today

69
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,400
before we get started i want to address

70
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,360
uh one of the

71
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,480
one of the most prolific members of the

72
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,080
security community

73
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,599
fred durst who once said

74
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,840
if you want to know how not secure you

75
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,000
are just take a look around

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,200
nothing secure nothing safe i don't hate

77
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,000
technology

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,920
i don't hate attackers because that's

79
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,000
what comes with it without those hackers

80
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,440
we wouldn't solve the problems that we

81
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,640
need to solve

82
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,440
especially security i think we all take

83
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,640
a moment to really

84
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,879
reflect on that statement we'll

85
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,160
understand the why

86
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,360
of why i decided to do this

87
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,560
so what is the point of using this ages

88
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,040
old

89
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,000
100 plus year old technology what

90
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,239
possible use could it have today

91
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,879
and as we as we go through the slides

92
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,159
that will explain to you

93
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,120
the history and the how-to just keep in

94
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,239
mind that

95
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,800
um there doesn't need to be a reason for

96
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,000
for everything

97
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,560
that you do um this just happened to be

98
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,040
something

99
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,959
i have a little bit of personal interest

100
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,239
in um

101
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,879
and and actually it was it started as

102
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,159
something that i wanted to do for the

103
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,480
first issue of the teletypist and didn't

104
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,640
uh really i didn't think that i could do

105
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,000
it so in a way

106
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,920
doing this was kind of my way of proving

107
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,440
to myself that i could that i could do

108
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,120
anything that i really wanted to

109
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,280
even if it seemed like totally useless

110
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,799
or totally off the wall

111
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,680
so thank you fred durst for restoring my

112
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,799
confidence

113
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,159
uh in in myself um okay so

114
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,360
about what what exactly

115
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,599
is a micro dot like maybe you've heard

116
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,879
the term and you're not exactly sure

117
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,000
what it is well

118
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,519
a micro dot is this thing i am trying

119
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,959
desperately to pick up

120
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,319
here this is a micro dot it's not

121
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:06,959
visible

122
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,280
probably on your end but i i assure you

123
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,879
that i'm holding a micro dot and i

124
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,159
have also lost this micro dot uh four

125
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,680
times in the past

126
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,320
uh 12 hours trying to experiment with

127
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,839
actually picking it up with a

128
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,800
a set of tweezers so micro dot is

129
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,840
essentially

130
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,240
an entire takes an entire page worth of

131
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,360
information

132
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,840
like this an entire legal page and it

133
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,759
shrinks it down into

134
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,960
a very small space

135
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,080
this this technology is not new it's

136
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,400
it's been around for a very long time

137
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,280
as i said it's over 100 years old uh if

138
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,360
we if we really were to go back and and

139
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,600
try and find exactly where it started

140
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,560
we would find that a micro dot was um

141
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,720
invented in the late 1800s

142
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,000
uh so it's not it's not new by any

143
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,720
stretch of the imagination um here's

144
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,280
here's

145
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,680
a photo of some micro dots that were

146
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,440
seized i believe this is like a

147
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,240
a cold war world war ii photo um this is

148
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,840
a series of micro dots

149
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,720
uh taken without magnification i believe

150
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,199
and

151
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,320
um this was uh you can actually find

152
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,759
this one on the wikipedia for

153
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,759
the national security agency so it's

154
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,680
it's out there and available but this is

155
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,280
essentially what i just held up with the

156
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,080
tweezers it's

157
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,120
a it's just a series of them all taped

158
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,520
to

159
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,160
a piece of paper or glued probably glued

160
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,240
to a piece of paper

161
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,800
um the earliest examples that we have of

162
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,880
micro dots being used in military

163
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,639
technology for an actual like real

164
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,000
practical purpose

165
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,160
um would be with if you're familiar with

166
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,160
rfc 2549

167
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,280
um the qos over avian carriers

168
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,960
which is a kind of a tongue it's a

169
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,680
tongue-in-cheek rfc but this actually

170
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,800
was the the um this is the the og

171
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,080
way of trans transferring information uh

172
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,720
from one place to another uh using

173
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,919
carrier pigeon

174
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,479
so what micro dots essentially allowed

175
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,560
us to do during world war one

176
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,360
is to send more information or or

177
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,280
essentially increase the bandwidth over

178
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,720
your avian carrier

179
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,840
by shrinking down the the the packet

180
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,319
size

181
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,120
so to speak and uh and allowing it to

182
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,000
attach to

183
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,280
us a carrier pigeon or homing pigeon

184
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:21,759
much

185
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,240
more easily than something that was much

186
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,360
larger

187
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,120
the the normal way of doing this would

188
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,880
be to print it out onto a very small

189
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,000
slip of paper

190
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,199
there's a little bit more weight

191
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,440
attached to that but with a pigeon

192
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,240
uh every ounce counts i just made that

193
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,880
up

194
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,440
so um doing micro dots is kind of just a

195
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,319
more

196
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,759
um it's a more natural uh

197
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,639
low overhead way of of transferring

198
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,440
information from one place to another

199
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,280
um but by the by the time we get to the

200
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,280
second world war microdot technologies

201
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,639
changed quite a bit

202
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,360
and uh and it turns out it's the uses

203
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,160
have changed

204
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,520
quite a bit as well so uh on the on the

205
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,520
images that you can see here on the left

206
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,080
there's a picture of uh

207
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,800
i believe this is a german produced um

208
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,599
micro dot

209
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,520
camera that's produced specifically for

210
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,639
the purpose of

211
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,360
creating micro dots um on the left on

212
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,000
the right side

213
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,199
you see an envelope with um actual micro

214
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,960
dots attached to it you can probably

215
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,960
barely see it but if you look very

216
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,520
closely at the open flap of the envelope

217
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,280
in the middle of the not the top part

218
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,520
but actually the center fold part of the

219
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,319
envelope

220
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,240
there's a very small red circle and

221
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,440
inside that red

222
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,080
circle is maybe three or four micro dots

223
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,840
attached to the page

224
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,080
so those are actually even smaller than

225
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,840
the ones that i produce

226
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,960
in this for this presentation

227
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,360
um this was this was in the this i

228
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,520
believe is the in the fbi collection

229
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,560
um and i believe this is also an example

230
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,440
of german

231
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,160
micro dot technology um but the the

232
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,720
reason

233
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,120
in in world war ii and and further into

234
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,919
the future

235
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,120
is for more uh covert um

236
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,479
message transfer so whereas the pigeons

237
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,160
were were also in a form of uh a form of

238
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,080
covert message transfer

239
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,240
um that was really that wasn't really

240
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,080
the primary driver for why they were

241
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,039
being used

242
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,840
um the primary driver was just for uh

243
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,840
for for short field communications

244
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,240
where radios may not be ubiquitous

245
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,039
um so there are there are some very

246
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,240
prominent examples

247
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,159
post-world war two where micro dots were

248
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,320
used for espionage purposes

249
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,559
um the man on the left is uh james

250
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,839
stockdale

251
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,599
james stockdale was a downed pilot

252
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,519
during the um

253
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,760
during the vietnam war he was kept in

254
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,880
holo prison

255
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,680
you probably know it as the hanoi hilton

256
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,959
what you may not know about

257
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,040
james stockton um stockton if you or

258
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,720
stockdale if you don't know of

259
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,160
of him uh as a person uh stockdale was

260
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,839
recruited by the cia

261
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,440
to um send messages uh from the prison

262
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,760
and report on conditions of prisoners he

263
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,480
was also

264
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,800
taking information from the agency at

265
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,320
the time as well

266
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,839
um stockdale was um more or less

267
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,680
recognized as the organizer inside

268
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,519
hollow for his stay there

269
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,760
um he was the he was actually in the

270
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,200
hanoi hilton from 1965 to 1973 so for

271
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,600
quite

272
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,880
a while uh he was the cia's go-to guy

273
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,279
for

274
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,480
organizing messages in and out of prison

275
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,240
um so so

276
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,080
there's there's a an evolution of

277
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,640
microdoc technology that leads up to

278
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,240
from from stockdale to the man that we

279
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,080
see on the right side

280
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,920
the man on the right side is named adolf

281
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,519
tokuchev

282
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,760
you may recognize tolkichev as

283
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,680
the billion dollar spy is kind of as

284
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,120
he's popular known

285
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,399
popularly known tolkachev was a

286
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,000
soviet-placed

287
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,680
science officer who used a variety of

288
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,730
methods to take photos of

289
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:02,880
[Music]

290
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,040
sensitive documents and got them back to

291
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,399
his cia handlers

292
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,160
during the 1970s i believe he was

293
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,600
arrested in the early 80s

294
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,720
by uh soviet uh hey tracy soviet folks

295
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,279
hi

296
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,640
sorry um so uh

297
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,800
yeah so we we have quite a few examples

298
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,880
of marker dots being used throughout the

299
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,240
cold war

300
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,880
um and and kind of coming into their own

301
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,279
as a technology for transferring secrets

302
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,360
we also have some non-espionage examples

303
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,120
that exist kind of throughout this time

304
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,720
period where they're being used

305
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,399
um on the far right you'll notice

306
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,240
something that it may be something that

307
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,360
looks familiar to you

308
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,720
it's a very small

309
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,000
book like thing with a micro dot inside

310
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,519
of it that just contains the lord's

311
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,399
prayer

312
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,480
um if you look through the the lens

313
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,640
there you'll see a very small

314
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,120
um and a large an enlargement of a very

315
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,680
small

316
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,519
uh copy of the lord's prayer on the

317
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,880
inside of the book

318
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,320
and peace people also use this

319
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,600
technology for all kinds of different

320
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,399
things like

321
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,079
um like in the middle image where

322
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,880
there's just a picture of a loved one

323
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,279
um same sort of effect there if you look

324
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,399
through the lens you'll see the

325
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,480
the picture on the on the inside but

326
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,959
also uh porn people liked to

327
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,839
have porn on them i i don't understand

328
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:18,240
uh

329
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,079
why you would need such a thing anywhere

330
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,360
you go but i guess

331
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,120
phones kind of changed our the way that

332
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,560
we consume that uh

333
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,120
type of imagery uh so on the far left

334
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,720
there you see just an

335
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,839
uh a very miniaturized uh pornographic

336
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,279
picture from the early

337
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,160
early days um so um micro dot production

338
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,760
so this is where things get kind of fun

339
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,680
and i'm sure why ultimately a lot of

340
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,800
folks

341
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,839
came to this presentation

342
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,320
so in my experimentation here i did this

343
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,720
uh with two stages

344
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,519
um the first stage will produce a micro

345
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,760
dot that's a little bit larger than the

346
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,320
one that i

347
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,200
showed earlier and as i try to take it

348
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,600
out of

349
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,560
my cap here you should get a micro dot

350
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,160
that's about the size

351
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,600
so this is 1.5 centimeters in length um

352
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,320
not i call this on my a macro dot so

353
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,000
it's not quite a micro dot but still

354
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,440
probably useful for some

355
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,200
um standard purposes um maybe where you

356
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,880
don't necessarily um this to me

357
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,560
is is the kind of um this is the

358
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,519
the method of micro dot technology where

359
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,120
if it

360
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,560
you may not you may not be having

361
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,560
somebody giving you too much scrutiny

362
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,399
but maybe just enough

363
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,160
that they might find something like this

364
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,320
um the information shouldn't be terribly

365
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,760
sensitive if you're using it but i

366
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,200
this is actually a copy of the one that

367
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,880
you see on the um

368
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,519
in the on the left image and then the

369
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,720
two stage

370
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,720
um the one on the right image that i

371
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,760
showed earlier

372
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,519
that's three millimeters in length so

373
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,360
actually much much smaller

374
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,600
um i would say just kind of reckoning

375
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,959
it's maybe

376
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,600
it's maybe a sixth the size of the macro

377
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,720
dot

378
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,839
so you can shrink down the image into

379
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,720
uh into very small pieces depending on

380
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,680
what your operational needs are

381
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,399
so the one stage method um this one is

382
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:12,880
actually

383
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,560
is fairly easy to do um but

384
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,839
what you do is you start with something

385
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,079
worth taking a photo of so

386
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,079
maybe this is one time pad keys maybe

387
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,000
this is privileged information or just

388
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,920
messages that you want to get to or from

389
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,800
somebody that's

390
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,639
possibly under surveillance um so

391
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,240
to do this you're going to need a few

392
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,800
different types of materials

393
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,440
um in my case i this is what i started

394
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,199
with this is just a

395
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,279
this is just a a forged uh one time pad

396
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,440
um i kind of reverse engineered this one

397
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,399
so i created the one time pad after i

398
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,600
created the message

399
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,279
um this is something that i'm using for

400
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,959
the teletypist so it just

401
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,760
uh i just kind of like did a keyboard

402
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,360
walk and created this

403
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,560
um but i start with this image and then

404
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,320
i start to gather up the other materials

405
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,440
that i need so

406
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,480
i have a 35 millimeter camera there's

407
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,160
nothing special about this this is just

408
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,920
something that i've i've had since

409
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,360
like i think i've had this camera since

410
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,120
high school um

411
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,000
some high grain black and white film is

412
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,120
something else that you're going to need

413
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,360
so in this case i just bought some 400

414
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,959
tx black and white

415
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,440
kodak it's it's cheap i forgot how much

416
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,880
i paid for it

417
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,000
um and then i also had kind of a stack

418
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,800
of materials

419
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,560
in the in the image that you see on the

420
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,760
right so on the right there is a

421
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,399
cutting board purple cutting board um i

422
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,399
also have an exacto knife

423
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,720
and underneath both of those things is a

424
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,079
black poster board which

425
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,880
um won't be used in the first uh the one

426
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,440
stage

427
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,839
method but it will be used in the in the

428
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:48,480
two stage

429
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,240
so just keep in mind that you saw that

430
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,839
here because it's gonna it's gonna come

431
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:52,399
back in

432
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,680
in a moment okay so this is declassified

433
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,760
from a cia document this is this is kind

434
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,079
of

435
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,279
just um demonstrating how we

436
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,680
have to set up our shot so in this

437
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,839
picture there's a

438
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,160
minox camera this is a camera that's

439
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,839
designed specifically for the purpose of

440
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,519
creating micro dots

441
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,800
this these were heavily used in the

442
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,720
1970s but you can see these

443
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,800
all over the place in uh museums that

444
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,560
have like old spy tech

445
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,760
um but these essentially the idea here

446
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,000
is

447
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,279
there's a piece of paper or

448
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,800
a document that you want to take a photo

449
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,839
of uh there's a very handy little

450
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,880
um uh stand that your camera can go on

451
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,199
to to hold it just far enough away from

452
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,120
the the page that you can take a photo

453
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,839
of it

454
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,600
and that it will be in focus when the

455
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,440
micro dot is created after you take the

456
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,800
photo

457
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,399
for my purposes though because i was

458
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,560
using a 35 millimeter camera

459
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,360
uh which is more of the the adolf

460
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,160
tolkitev

461
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,680
way of doing it if you're familiar with

462
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,399
that case um i just stood in my kitchen

463
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:54,720
and

464
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,959
and took a photo of the the subject

465
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:57,839
document that i

466
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,399
needed to take a photo of um what you're

467
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,440
trying to do here

468
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,720
is to um uh get the

469
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,800
the piece of paper or the document that

470
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,240
you want to photograph

471
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,680
to fill the entire viewfinder focus it

472
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,079
and then snap your photo that's really

473
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,120
all there is to it

474
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,040
um what you're going to produce there is

475
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,320
a 35 millimeter

476
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,800
negative that's a that's a full size 35

477
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
millimeter negative um

478
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,920
of just the document so once you do that

479
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,720
then

480
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,199
um that that's that's essentially the

481
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,720
first stage

482
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,880
um there are different ways of doing

483
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,199
this so just as kind of an addendum

484
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,959
if you wanted to make a much smaller

485
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,800
micro dot so if you wanted to

486
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,959
um if you wanted to end up with the with

487
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,759
the 1.5 centimeter

488
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,480
macro dot that i create here what you

489
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,079
would do essentially is increase the

490
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,680
distance between the document

491
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,880
and the camera lens and um there there

492
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,040
are lots of ways that you can do this

493
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,199
uh in my in my case i used a very

494
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,199
advanced technology technological method

495
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,360
called standing on my kitchen counter

496
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,759
and taking a photo of it just making

497
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:04,880
sure that i could get the

498
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,199
the focus right on the document um

499
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,480
so this this is you know easy to do

500
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,280
uh if you if you had a situation or

501
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,199
environment where you could do this

502
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,839
there's no reason not to do it this way

503
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,720
given enough

504
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,799
focal length you could do something like

505
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,160
stand on a ladder as well

506
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,880
and also get a similar result that would

507
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,640
actually be much smaller probably closer

508
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,600
to the one millimeter

509
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,360
or the 1.52 millimeter um micro dot like

510
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,120
true micro dot size

511
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,120
um but it's it's all about your setup

512
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,640
and what type of

513
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,600
camera that you're using

514
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,760
so the limits the limitations to

515
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,280
miniaturization just on

516
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,799
on a stage on a one stage micro dot

517
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,120
are your distance from the target the

518
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,559
focal length that you have

519
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,120
or how focused your lens is going to let

520
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,480
you get

521
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,480
the film contrast and then the

522
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,679
practicality like

523
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,760
why why you would need uh something

524
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,280
that's much smaller versus something

525
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,280
that's that's quite a bit larger

526
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,160
so um some of these are techn are

527
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,600
problems that you can solve through

528
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,720
technology

529
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,919
and others um others are just

530
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,720
you know more operational need type of

531
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,840
uh driven

532
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,200
decision making so it's really up to you

533
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,720
it's really up to you and your needs if

534
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,039
you

535
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,799
do end up in a situation where you need

536
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,080
something much smaller though

537
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,760
film contrast and focal length are going

538
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,799
to come much more into play

539
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,080
in fact all of these things will

540
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,080
probably be

541
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,760
much more difficult to do if you're in

542
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,840
an operational environment where you

543
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,520
need to have something that's that's

544
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,120
quite a bit smaller than what i've

545
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,080
uh produced here from the one stage but

546
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,799
once you

547
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,400
once you take your photo and you send it

548
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,320
to the developers

549
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,679
what you're going to get back is is

550
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,679
basically what you see here so it's a 35

551
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,039
millimeter negative

552
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,480
um i have already cut off the bottom uh

553
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,840
reel holders so that's you're looking at

554
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,799
just the

555
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,960
um just the bottom part cut off but

556
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,160
that's the only processing that's

557
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,360
happened here

558
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,960
what you would do then is then put this

559
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,400
into the the cutting board

560
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,960
kind of cut it along the the edge of the

561
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,679
sheet

562
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,000
and you would have you would have a 35mm

563
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,919
standard 35 millimeter frame

564
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,840
with just the information that you

565
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,520
needed to miniaturize on it

566
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,200
this is already quite a bit smaller than

567
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,960
a legal pad so if you can imagine

568
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,880
what a 35 millimeter negative looks like

569
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,960
versus the full size page of of

570
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,240
information

571
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,360
um it's quite a bit smaller so

572
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,520
that alone may be all that you need

573
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,760
operationally in order to

574
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,440
get your information from one place to

575
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,799
another or to

576
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,160
uh or

577
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,360
or to even just maintain the information

578
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,400
that you have

579
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,000
in a state that's gonna make it

580
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,520
semi-secure and

581
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,080
easy to store but again operational

582
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,880
needs here

583
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,559
something that you probably want to take

584
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,120
into account

585
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,600
this image is just a comparison between

586
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,760
the the macro dot that i've created

587
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,760
on the um on the left

588
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,360
and the standard 35 millimeter size so

589
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,000
as you can see here it's maybe uh 1 4

590
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,320
the size the macro dot is of a standard

591
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,240
35 millimeter

592
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,039
i would add definitely still readable

593
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:21,440
through

594
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,600
by the human eye just by the naked eye

595
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,720
without having to

596
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,600
magnify it at all so i you know you can

597
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,200
hold this thing up to

598
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,080
uh a clear sky and read the entire

599
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,559
document if you needed to um

600
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,480
for for either of the examples here

601
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,559
including the the macro dot

602
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,240
so no advanced um magnification is

603
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,600
needed in order to

604
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,120
read the information that you have

605
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,120
miniaturized um

606
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,799
again it's kind of just about where you

607
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,400
want to put it though so like

608
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,280
if you if you had a specific method in

609
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:53,760
mind

610
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,600
to transfer this information or a

611
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,840
specific place that you needed to put it

612
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,880
um the the smaller macro dot

613
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,200
may be the best option for you um but

614
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,640
you'll you'll see an example

615
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,120
in in coming slides of where you might

616
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,559
want something that's kind of more in

617
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,280
the middle of

618
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,640
a a a true micro dot one millimeter

619
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,520
versus

620
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,720
the the macro dot so to speak at um

621
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,760
maybe one and a half centimeters but

622
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,200
this is what the this is what the macro

623
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,039
dot looks like when you hold it up to a

624
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:23,600
clear

625
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,120
sky day um i i usually wear glasses so

626
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,640
it's not

627
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,559
eminently readable for me but probably

628
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:31,840
for many of you you'll be able to

629
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,039
actually see this

630
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,960
um this is uh enlarged just slightly

631
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,120
so um it's act it's actually a little

632
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,840
bit bigger than than the macro that is

633
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,880
uh in true size in the picture

634
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,000
um so there's uh there there's a

635
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,600
there's only a minor amount of

636
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,440
magnification happening here which means

637
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:51,840
that

638
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,159
even under um more difficult

639
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,600
circumstances where you don't have

640
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,200
magnification i mean you could move it

641
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,520
closer to your eye and be able to see it

642
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,640
um just as easily

643
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,520
so okay so who cares what what do we do

644
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,720
with one stage

645
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,880
well as i was saying before if you had

646
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,080
an operational need

647
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,799
where you needed to transfer information

648
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:13,120
um

649
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,679
on a macro dot you could put this kind

650
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,200
of thing under a stamp

651
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,600
um so here's just kind of an example of

652
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,600
how it would fit under a standard

653
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,200
us posted stamp it would definitely fit

654
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:25,600
there

655
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,360
you would just attach it to an envelope

656
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,480
and the macro dot would be there

657
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,679
not many people are going to think to

658
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,360
look at it there unless they are doing

659
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:33,679
like

660
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,919
counterintelligence work or are familiar

661
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,679
with this method

662
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,600
stamps are kind of a standard place to

663
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,679
put micro dots though so

664
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,000
if you're in a position of needing to

665
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,679
transfer that information a little bit

666
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:46,240
more

667
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,640
discreetly of stamp probably wouldn't be

668
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,600
the best way to do it

669
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,600
but then there's a two-stage method as

670
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,280
well so if you

671
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,559
um if you have two rolls of film and

672
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,039
you develop the first one and you decide

673
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,320
that you just need something that's a

674
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,520
little bit smaller

675
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,159
you would move on to uh the the two

676
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:06,720
stage

677
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,720
so just to recap where we were with the

678
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,480
end of the first stage

679
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,440
we ended up with a 1.5 centimeter um

680
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,000
negative

681
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,080
that can be read with the human eye um

682
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,120
without any magnification

683
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,880
so you would take that you would take

684
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,960
that cut that board the blackboard that

685
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,159
i told you about before

686
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,320
that i told you was going to come back

687
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,760
you take your exaction knife

688
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,960
and you cut out a very small section

689
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,000
for your either your one one and a half

690
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,280
centimeter macro dot

691
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,559
or 35 millimeter standard negative which

692
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,280
is what i i

693
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,799
used here actually um i used an

694
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,520
insulated foam board because uh it

695
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,320
actually

696
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,520
held the negative better so it fits in

697
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,240
the slot

698
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,279
and it didn't move around very much um

699
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,799
in the process of attaching it to the

700
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,960
lamp so you do need to backlight it

701
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,960
and and i would just point out that this

702
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,799
is this is a very

703
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,159
uh low-cost setup here to produce the

704
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,000
the micro dot

705
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,919
by attaching it to by attaching the

706
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,440
blackboard to

707
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,480
um uh just a lamp in my

708
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,520
in my works workroom um that was enough

709
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,640
backlighting to

710
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,440
give me an image that came through so i

711
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,880
would stand maybe

712
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,600
uh three or four feet from the from the

713
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,480
board

714
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,240
focus it as best i could and take a

715
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,720
photo now the wisdom i would say about

716
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,600
doing it this way

717
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,480
is that uh it doesn't always work quite

718
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,000
the way that you would expect

719
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
in practice so um the the instructions

720
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,640
that i got

721
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,240
were from an old book uh on just like

722
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,760
it's one of those children's kind of

723
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,559
children's book on spy technology

724
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,600
uh like older spy technology and this is

725
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,039
this is called the british method

726
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,760
of micro dot creation so the british

727
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,640
method

728
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,720
uh says that when you go to do this part

729
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,159
that you should make sure that the

730
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,080
the negative is in focus in reality

731
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,000
you're not really going to be able to

732
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,200
focus this up

733
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,640
in a way that's going to be done

734
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,480
competently so you kind of just have to

735
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,000
do it as best you can

736
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,200
and hope for the best at the end um

737
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,039
with more advanced technology this kind

738
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,400
of eliminates the problem

739
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,559
of having to focus on something that's

740
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,400
already small to begin with

741
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,279
um i will go over some ways to improve

742
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,279
this process though if you were to

743
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,000
uh want to do this for some things more

744
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,640
like

745
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,400
use around the house or whatever if

746
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,159
you've got a modern use for this

747
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,320
but this is this is the best that i

748
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,400
could do i still ended up with a result

749
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,120
though

750
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,480
and here's what it looks like

751
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,559
so when you get the film back after the

752
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,799
the stade the two stage method

753
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,720
you get your true micro dot and this is

754
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,159
as it appears on the

755
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,200
on the actual negative

756
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,000
so when you get this back it's really

757
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,200
just a matter of doing the same thing

758
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,039
that you did with the with the one stage

759
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,919
you um cut very carefully around the

760
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:00,400
edges

761
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,200
and this this is where the x-acto knife

762
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,799
comes in really handy

763
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,039
um just very carefully cutting the

764
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,400
rectangle out

765
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,120
and doing your best not to lose it which

766
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,840
seriously

767
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,360
is um a big headache with these

768
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,000
um one of my one of my consultant

769
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,679
contacts on this project

770
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,840
johnna mendez um was explaining to me

771
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,200
that

772
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
you may just be in a situation where you

773
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,559
if you're if you're doing this

774
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,640
uh back in the old days they would have

775
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,000
these problems where

776
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,240
in the lab they would have um they would

777
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,200
have negatives

778
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,760
that were this size and the microdot

779
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,559
would come back

780
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,960
and um if somebody just kind of like

781
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,039
sneezed in the wrong place or breathed

782
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,159
the wrong way

783
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,000
it would just become dust and would

784
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,440
disappear into

785
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,960
into the ether so um keeping track of

786
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,320
microdots is actually much more

787
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,520
difficult

788
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,039
even than you than you may think so um

789
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,120
the the met the preferred method of

790
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,720
transferring a micro dot from one place

791
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,279
to another

792
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,400
is to lick the fingertip uh dab and then

793
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,720
pick it up just like this

794
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,960
uh if you end up having to handle them

795
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,559
it's just a practical issue that you're

796
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:08,880
gonna

797
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,039
you're gonna have to try to find a way

798
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,320
to work around

799
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,000
um but this is ultimately what it looks

800
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,200
like when you get it all cut out

801
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,399
so it literally is um it's smaller than

802
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:21,440
my fingertip

803
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,679
um which is why these things are so

804
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,240
difficult to keep track of

805
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,120
so um so that's the two step the two

806
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,559
stage method

807
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,520
um there are practical differences

808
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,240
between

809
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,919
the one stage and two stage method um

810
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,279
again most of this is just going to be

811
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,440
operations need driven maybe your need

812
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,520
is just to

813
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,200
retain some information so that it

814
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,520
doesn't get lost and you don't want to

815
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,080
you don't want anybody to find it that

816
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,559
this is

817
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,279
this is going to be a really um probably

818
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,039
a more difficult option

819
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,399
than the than the macro dot is for just

820
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,720
keeping track of it um but i mean i've

821
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,000
i've even talked to people

822
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,880
who um maybe are ex-military and they

823
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,399
if you know anybody or if you've been in

824
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:09,919
the military yourself i haven't been in

825
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,600
the military myself but i do know

826
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,919
people who um i've known a lot of folks

827
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,440
who've gotten out of the military

828
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,600
and your dd214 is just something you

829
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,600
can't you can't ever lose that

830
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,080
you you can and you can't get one back

831
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,840
but if you lose that document

832
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,080
um it's gonna cause some trouble for you

833
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,880
so

834
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,640
um i've known people print out a

835
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,799
trillion copies of their dd214 just to

836
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,399
have them around so maybe this is

837
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,000
one thing that you want to do is take a

838
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,159
pic a picture of your dd214 just so you

839
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:36,799
have

840
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,679
a million dust sized copies of it laying

841
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,039
around

842
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,000
um but the the obvious problem once you

843
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,760
get something the size is okay well how

844
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,760
am i gonna how am i gonna read this

845
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,080
um this is not readable with the naked

846
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,120
eye

847
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,360
um you can kind of see when something is

848
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,480
etched to the photo

849
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,200
but it's or to the negative but it's not

850
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,320
it's not readable

851
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,039
um even even just if you hold it super

852
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,399
close to your eye is no way that you're

853
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:03,600
going to be able to actually

854
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,919
determine the difference between letters

855
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:07,279
so the way that that

856
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,720
professionals um view micro dots

857
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,159
is with the stanhope lens um the one

858
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,200
in the upper left uh the the metallic

859
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:17,600
one

860
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,440
is like one that you could wear around

861
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,880
your neck possibly it's

862
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,200
that's an antique stanhope lens where

863
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,559
you would just

864
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,039
uh put them the micro dot on the flat

865
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,159
end and then you could read it through

866
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:28,559
the

867
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,679
the curved end um

868
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,919
the the more modern version of the the

869
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,279
antique stanhope lens

870
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,440
is one of those little and most people

871
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,200
have seen this i think like a little

872
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,000
uh gift box with maybe a picture or

873
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,919
grain of rice or something that's had

874
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,279
a picture put on it or um

875
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,000
a message written on it you can just put

876
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,080
it in a little plastic box like this

877
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,960
and uh and read the micro dot um but

878
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,399
they they've also

879
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:00,240
done uh put stand hope lenses into

880
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,000
things like uh the ring that you see on

881
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,279
the on the right side again

882
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,640
uh with with porn in it um so there

883
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,840
there are lots of different ways that

884
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,799
you can

885
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,279
um maintain a micro dot and read it

886
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,720
later on

887
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,720
um all of these are options that you can

888
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,080
that are still

889
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,480
uh fairly readily available so there's

890
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,159
they're not too hard to get

891
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,880
um and then this is what it looks like

892
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,159
under magnification

893
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,120
so if you wanted to look at the the

894
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,640
micro dot what you would see

895
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,600
is more uh the image on the left side

896
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,080
now

897
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,320
i will freely admit that my micro dot

898
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,399
did not come out great um

899
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,200
it's not readable it's not it you can

900
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,240
see the difference

901
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,960
in in the micro dot and the macro dot in

902
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,559
terms of readability

903
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,760
um and again i will i will explain how

904
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,000
we can improve this operationally

905
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,799
in the future um and then on the right

906
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:53,679
side there's

907
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,240
uh this is this is actually a smaller

908
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,919
version of the macro dot that i was able

909
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,640
to produce with the one stage method

910
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,320
um so we we did get one that was

911
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,559
uh quite a bit smaller but not readable

912
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:07,760
with the human eye

913
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,880
or with the naked eye and um but but

914
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,679
very readable under um under

915
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,519
magnification

916
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,240
so in this case i put the micro dot and

917
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,399
the macro dot into my son's antique

918
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:21,200
microscope

919
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,600
and uh and looked at them that way

920
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,679
so okay so modern use um there's

921
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,000
there's maybe a misconception that old

922
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,159
technology has become obsolete and

923
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,120
there's no

924
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,720
reason to revisit them if that's

925
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,360
kind of the camp that you're in then i

926
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,320
here's a meme for you

927
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,720
dots are absolutely not played out

928
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,799
technology they're just in search of a

929
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:49,200
new

930
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,519
application is my nice way of putting

931
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:52,559
this

932
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,080
so if you need to do there's all kinds

933
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,519
of different ways that you can use these

934
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:57,919
things

935
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,159
um some some notes on operational

936
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,000
security though before we get into the

937
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,279
the more um modern use cases uh

938
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,120
problems that we encountered during this

939
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,039
process of bandwidth obviously

940
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,799
the amount of information transferable

941
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,399
is relatively small

942
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:16,000
it's it's fairly labor-intensive um

943
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,320
the development is something that you

944
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,919
you end up having to deal with because

945
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:20,799
there's not

946
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,799
uh there's not a whole lot of folks that

947
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,080
are actually developing

948
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,519
film in person anymore um in a way that

949
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,679
you can get the negatives from

950
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,080
and um and it's also it's also very low

951
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,360
tech so if you wanted to process

952
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,880
something and take it from an analog

953
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,320
state to a digital state it's going to

954
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,039
be

955
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,159
uh definitely non-trivial to do that um

956
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,039
which maybe there's

957
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,799
maybe there's benefits to doing it that

958
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,159
way um

959
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,440
again all all up to your needs um

960
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,480
and how you apply the technology

961
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,039
um a note on the film development though

962
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:53,519
so

963
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,279
what i did was i ended up mailing out

964
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,919
the negatives to a film processor that

965
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:58,480
did this

966
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,840
relatively cheaply i think each um uh

967
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,320
each development job on the two rolls

968
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,519
the film that i

969
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,720
submitted to them were 13 apiece so

970
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,200
it's not it's not terribly expensive for

971
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,279
this kind of one-off use case it was

972
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,200
it was affordable for me just to have

973
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,559
fun with um

974
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,120
if you had to do this at scale though i

975
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,320
wouldn't recommend using

976
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,240
a micro dot like a standard micro dot

977
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,799
for this a standard analog micro dot for

978
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,559
this

979
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,600
um but so modern use cases uh maybe

980
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,760
you have something like a bitcoin key

981
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,880
and you don't want to

982
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,279
buy one of these big ridiculous chunks

983
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,640
of metal to

984
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,159
inscribe your key onto this one

985
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,399
was submitted to reddit about two weeks

986
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,000
ago and i found it

987
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,440
um somebody had uh sent me this on

988
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:47,919
twitter

989
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,840
and and kind of pointed out this this

990
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,240
thing and somebody had found in a wall

991
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,440
and they weren't sure what it was it

992
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,840
turns out it's probably a bitcoin key

993
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,399
so um what you would do with this is you

994
00:33:58,399 --> 00:33:59,279
you could

995
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,480
uh apply a micro dot technology to make

996
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,640
a miniaturized version of your

997
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,440
bitcoin key so that you can store all

998
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:07,840
your

999
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,440
uh your fake money securely that way

1000
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,639
um you could also save something like a

1001
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,520
one-time pad

1002
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,320
or a very sensitive set of keys that you

1003
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,800
don't want anyone to get a hold of

1004
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,960
you could save that to a micro dot and

1005
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,560
put it inside of something else so in

1006
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,280
this case

1007
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,000
there's all these stories of the kgb

1008
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,359
used to

1009
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,560
um create one-time pads and then put

1010
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,480
them into concealment so that their

1011
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,119
their assets overseas could use them um

1012
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:37,599
there's

1013
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,320
there's a particularly prominent one of

1014
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,679
the authorities going to

1015
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,320
um investigate the house of a spy

1016
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,119
somewhere

1017
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,079
in west berlin is like the closest i can

1018
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:48,560
find

1019
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,679
information on this and um the subject

1020
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,119
house is completely empty

1021
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,440
of all food except for this big like

1022
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,719
pile of walnuts

1023
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,440
in the middle of their kitchen table um

1024
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,480
and then so when they

1025
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,320
started looking at the walnuts they

1026
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,480
cracked they cracked one open and found

1027
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,000
the one time pad so um if you had like a

1028
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,760
specifically a particularly

1029
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,680
sensitive set of keys that you needed to

1030
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,359
keep a hold of that

1031
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:17,359
um that you maybe didn't want to

1032
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,800
write by hand on a piece of paper or um

1033
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,040
printing it out in a in a very super

1034
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,920
small way just

1035
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,320
doesn't make sense um microdots might be

1036
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,400
a good solution for you

1037
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,480
so there are a few modern uses for this

1038
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,599
technology

1039
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,720
um that you you could you could easily

1040
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,720
get like a new a new sense of um

1041
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,760
uh application out of

1042
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,160
there's also a this concept of a digital

1043
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,520
micro dot which is something that i'm

1044
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,160
kind of still

1045
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,960
playing around with so with the uh sorry

1046
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,599
about that

1047
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,119
with the um the advent of extremely

1048
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,200
of ultra high resolution imagery

1049
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,280
you may have seen it where you can take

1050
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,680
a photo of a cityscape and zoom in from

1051
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,040
miles away on

1052
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,920
like the the type of like you you could

1053
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,640
read a message on somebody's coffee mug

1054
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,280
um that type of digital technology could

1055
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,839
easily be used and reapplied to create

1056
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,000
something that that is akin to a digital

1057
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,119
micro dot

1058
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,400
um by hiding information in a an ultra

1059
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,200
high resolution image and just giving

1060
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,640
somebody

1061
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,400
who needs that information the exact um

1062
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,400
mapping on the image where they need to

1063
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,680
look you could

1064
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,560
encode information and hide it in uh in

1065
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,000
a digital image

1066
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,760
um whether this is practical or not

1067
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,359
again just kind of boils down to your

1068
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:40,560
your operational

1069
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,720
conditions um it doesn't

1070
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,040
you you would be applying a digital

1071
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,079
technology for

1072
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,680
essentially very little um

1073
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,800
very little uh bandwidth in

1074
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,440
transferring of data and that would also

1075
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,400
be fairly labor intensive as well

1076
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,359
um i did have a slide but i i guess i

1077
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:04,640
must have passed over it

1078
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,000
one thing that you're going to need to

1079
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
take a note of kind of

1080
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,160
ways to improve next time is um

1081
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,320
for for my situation with the micro dot

1082
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,680
i would have certainly

1083
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,359
used a micro fiche or a much more high

1084
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:20,640
contrast

1085
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,000
film stock that that would have been

1086
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,520
that probably would have given me a true

1087
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,920
micro dot and something's readable under

1088
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,280
magnification

1089
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,320
so um there there were a number of

1090
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,000
suggestions made to me in the twitter

1091
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,520
thread where i kind of like laid all of

1092
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,839
this out

1093
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,240
a lot of those film stocks are are

1094
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,160
actually still available and relatively

1095
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:42,560
cheap

1096
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,000
so if this is something that you want to

1097
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,760
reproduce

1098
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,160
get to me after and i can try and dig up

1099
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,599
that information

1100
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,040
but that would definitely be something i

1101
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,640
would improve for next time

1102
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,520
um you could also improve the focal

1103
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,960
length of your camera by

1104
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,200
getting a lens that would allow you to

1105
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,400
focus in on something that's much

1106
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,359
smaller

1107
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,599
um there's a lot of different things

1108
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:04,640
that you could do to

1109
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,960
improve this process um as somebody

1110
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,880
who's never made micro dots before i

1111
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,400
learned a lot from this

1112
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,960
um i learned a lot about the the

1113
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,560
applications of technology that you

1114
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,480
could or the applications to modern

1115
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,880
problems that you could uh put this

1116
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,680
toward

1117
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,160
so this was for me this is just a very

1118
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,400
fun kind of hackery experiment

1119
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,119
um speaks very much to the ethos of just

1120
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,800
kind of doing something because you can

1121
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,599
and learning a lot from it so if you're

1122
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:32,079
interested

1123
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,280
and you have some of these materials

1124
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,359
just kind of laying around the house uh

1125
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,280
there's there's really no no good reason

1126
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,200
not to try it and see

1127
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,440
how you do with it and now that you have

1128
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,599
um the information on how to do it

1129
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:49,119
um then go forth and give it a try

1130
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,000
um so i wanna before i go to questions i

1131
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,520
do wanna throw a special thanks out

1132
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,480
there to

1133
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,720
um two people who help me out here so

1134
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,599
johna mendez

1135
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,400
and dr vince houghton um gave me a lot

1136
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,000
of information

1137
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,160
when i was doing the research for this

1138
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,920
really all i had to start with because

1139
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,520
the techniques are not

1140
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,119
um well known in in public spheres

1141
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,680
um all i had to start with was a snippet

1142
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,400
from a book

1143
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,280
that came from a forum thread that

1144
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,240
pointed me to

1145
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,520
the um the the kids book on how to

1146
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,720
create micro dots

1147
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,599
and even that was not very thorough so a

1148
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:26,960
lot of this i had to kind of piece

1149
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,560
through piece together through just

1150
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,520
trial and error and my best reckoning

1151
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,000
for

1152
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,520
how to how to do it properly so there's

1153
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,200
that again is just kind of like another

1154
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,960
thing that speaks to the the ethos of

1155
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,440
just

1156
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,839
throw stuff at the wall and you may

1157
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,280
learn something that is not common

1158
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,800
knowledge and maybe you can

1159
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,400
hand it out to other people who are

1160
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,160
interested so

1161
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,320
that's my entire presentation uh i

1162
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,440
believe i have like

1163
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,240
five minutes for questions so if anyone

1164
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,040
has anything

1165
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,280
um uh i'm i'm open for questions now

1166
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,960
great thanks very much emily that was

1167
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,880
awesome we got a lot of good questions

1168
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,160
and even some dad jokes

1169
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,480
uh in the chat going on when you're uh

1170
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,839
when you're talking so let's uh let's

1171
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:08,720
break through there's a lot of really

1172
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,960
good questions that people got here

1173
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,359
um let's see so first one from dave uh

1174
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:14,400
dave mattingly

1175
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,400
uh he was wondering in spy history where

1176
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,760
micro dots generally

1177
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,680
in very tiny clear texture where they're

1178
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:25,839
also encoded

1179
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,040
i'm sorry could you hear me in there oh

1180
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,319
i don't think i could hear you

1181
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:35,520
sorry i apologize let me

1182
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,079
let me just go in by hearing might have

1183
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:38,640
been me

1184
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:43,200
sorry oh okay can you hear me next

1185
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,280
okay great right okay so sorry first

1186
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,800
question uh was from dave manning he's

1187
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,560
learning in spy history

1188
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,880
where micro dots generally in very tiny

1189
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,079
clear text or were they

1190
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,280
also encoded um so they

1191
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,040
you could see them in both uh generally

1192
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,640
they were encoded though so if they were

1193
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,680
used in wartime

1194
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,200
they would they would probably encode

1195
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,839
them um

1196
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,680
yeah most of the examples i've seen have

1197
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,040
been encoded text

1198
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,760
uh committed to microdot um just it just

1199
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,599
doesn't add a layer of security

1200
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,319
so the entire process here is a process

1201
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:14,880
of

1202
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,319
security through obscurity ultimately um

1203
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:21,280
which we we tend to um we tend to look

1204
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,680
down on in modern digital security

1205
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,880
but there's there's you can't undercut

1206
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,720
the fact that there may just be an

1207
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,920
application where

1208
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,599
obscurity is gonna help you out quite a

1209
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,079
bit um in the event that i

1210
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,480
lose this it's you're not gonna find

1211
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,920
these things i mean like i

1212
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,720
i only found it because i knew that i

1213
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,800
dropped it in the general vicinity like

1214
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,359
i

1215
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,359
jeff saw me drop this thing and i was

1216
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:46,960
like i instantly

1217
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,359
did not know where it went so if you're

1218
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:50,560
if you're making micro dots the

1219
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,560
perishability of the data is like

1220
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,280
almost instantaneous if you if you it

1221
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,200
would get vacuumed up in my house easily

1222
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,240
so encoding it

1223
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,720
is is just kind of an added bonus to

1224
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,640
putting it on a microdog

1225
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,520
okay great thanks and uh so susie asks

1226
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,200
uh if this was similar or is there some

1227
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,200
maybe some overlaps to microfiche

1228
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,520
years ago yeah there's a lot of there's

1229
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,560
a lot of overlap

1230
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,880
um the two technologies are basically

1231
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,599
the same thing

1232
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,960
so um whereas microfiche is meant to

1233
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,880
take an entire archive and make it small

1234
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,560
enough for storage

1235
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,520
um the the original intent as i as i

1236
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,960
kind of went over in the early slides

1237
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,920
was to make it

1238
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,319
easier for for a homing pigeon to carry

1239
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:31,520
it um

1240
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,599
but yeah the another kind of modern

1241
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,440
instantiation of this is to take entire

1242
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,160
libraries

1243
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,560
and and shrink down the information into

1244
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,319
something that's just easier to store so

1245
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:40,720
it's

1246
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,280
essentially the same technology um

1247
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,960
you're using the same film stock if you

1248
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,640
really want to get one that's that's in

1249
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,680
good condition readable so yeah there's

1250
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,440
there's definitely overlapping there

1251
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,520
i guess you went to try to reset that

1252
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,400
mark asks or maybe more of a comment you

1253
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,760
can elaborate on so it doesn't seem like

1254
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,280
there's any equipment needed here that

1255
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:01,680
seems

1256
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,680
particularly incriminating maybe that's

1257
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,520
by design

1258
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,640
uh yeah there's there's really not um

1259
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,119
there's there's nothing incriminating

1260
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,680
about the technology that i used here

1261
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,480
and in part that that that could be by

1262
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,240
design i believe the british method was

1263
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,839
probably created for that specific

1264
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:21,200
purpose

1265
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,280
um but yeah i mean you could go through

1266
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,560
the trouble of buying

1267
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,800
a very old minox camera i don't know

1268
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,319
that anybody really produces these

1269
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:29,440
things anymore so

1270
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,960
if you wanted one it would probably be

1271
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,720
an antique in the first place

1272
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,400
um but but yeah there's you're not using

1273
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,160
any any specialized equipment here

1274
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,520
i was actually one of the things i was

1275
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,119
super shocked by when i started doing

1276
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,880
this project was that i didn't need to

1277
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,480
the only the most specialized piece of

1278
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,760
equipment that i bought that because i

1279
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,599
didn't have it was an exacto knife

1280
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,240
but everything else is is just you would

1281
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,599
probably have it around the house you

1282
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:52,319
could do this

1283
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:55,440
easily yeah uh maybe a follow-up

1284
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,400
question

1285
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,640
from dave since most modern cameras have

1286
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,599
auto focus

1287
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,359
he's wondering if older cameras work

1288
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:02,800
best

1289
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,319
i would imagine that probably older

1290
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,079
cameras do work best um

1291
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:07,520
you're gonna need to have the manual

1292
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,440
focus because a lot of times these

1293
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,960
documents are going to be just small

1294
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,319
enough that you're not going to be able

1295
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:12,720
to

1296
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,920
focus in on them with autofocus it's a

1297
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,040
good notation

1298
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,920
not a problem i ran into because my

1299
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,560
single lens reflex camera is

1300
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,520
is manual by default so i would have to

1301
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,319
switch on

1302
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:28,240
autofocus in order to get that that

1303
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,520
feature

1304
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,800
okay great uh another question

1305
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,800
is the information content of a micro

1306
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,000
dot more limited

1307
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
by the resolution of the film or the

1308
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,920
maximum distance between the camera and

1309
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,760
the object

1310
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,400
so i would say that it's it's more the

1311
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,240
resolution of the film

1312
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,839
because the smaller that you're getting

1313
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:49,599
it the more contrast you're going to

1314
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:50,480
have between

1315
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,599
the um the characters

1316
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,319
and the the just the kind of natural

1317
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:57,359
background of the

1318
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:00,480
film stock so in my case what i

1319
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,440
experienced was

1320
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,640
a much more pronounced difference in

1321
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,280
um a much a much higher limitation i

1322
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:07,839
should say

1323
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:10,160
in uh film stock than i did just the

1324
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,280
distance between my

1325
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,480
my lens and the the image now i i would

1326
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,680
say that

1327
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,800
if i wanted to do like a one a one stop

1328
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,480
or a one stage film uh product that

1329
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,480
that got me a micro dot that would

1330
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,079
probably be easier than

1331
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:28,480
um doing the focus on the two stage

1332
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,440
because

1333
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,760
focusing in on the on the like 35

1334
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,720
millimeter

1335
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,520
um negative is is not to be understated

1336
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,960
how difficult that is

1337
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,560
there's you're really it's a guessing

1338
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,000
game there's just really no way of

1339
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,520
knowing whether you're in focus or not

1340
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,200
at least in in the way that i did it

1341
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,119
so it turns out that i think it probably

1342
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,240
was relatively

1343
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,440
in focus when i took the photo but the

1344
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,520
the lacking quality of the film stock

1345
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,720
just didn't make it

1346
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,240
readable but you can kind of you can

1347
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,000
tell what it was for sure if you knew

1348
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,280
what you started with so

1349
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,160
i'll consider that a victory yeah

1350
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,040
absolutely

1351
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,680
that's impressive uh see a follow-up

1352
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,240
here

1353
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,160
uh from dave if i remember right aren't

1354
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,839
negatives usually mirror image

1355
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:09,440
so would a micro dot usually come out

1356
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,280
reversed unless some sort of steps were

1357
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,000
taken

1358
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,839
yeah that's that's an interesting

1359
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:15,599
question and one that i thought of that

1360
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,359
was actually i had a conversation

1361
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:19,440
with johnna mendez on the phone janna

1362
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,400
used to uh

1363
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,040
she used to work for the the agency and

1364
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,680
she was chief of disguise for many years

1365
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,040
uh one of the things that i asked her

1366
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,880
before i started the two step or the two

1367
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,319
stage was like

1368
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:31,760
is this going to be reversed do i need

1369
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,599
to worry about that and she's like

1370
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,720
i don't know so uh so i ended up having

1371
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,240
to kind of um

1372
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,000
figure that one out on my own but i i

1373
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,079
think the reality of the situation

1374
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,560
is that the negative itself is visible

1375
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,000
from both sides

1376
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,720
so whether it's reversed or not doesn't

1377
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,359
actually

1378
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:51,920
impact the end state product with this

1379
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,640
technique

1380
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,960
or at least i didn't experience it in a

1381
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:55,760
way that really

1382
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,400
i ran into any problems now again it's

1383
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,359
not it's not

1384
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:00,960
it wasn't terribly readable on the on

1385
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,599
the micro dot version so i i can't say

1386
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:04,560
that with 100

1387
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,040
certainty but i don't believe i had any

1388
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,319
reversing i think it

1389
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,079
i think it was as it should be when i

1390
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,359
when i when it came out

1391
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,599
ultimately so good question though

1392
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,119
something i have to deal with

1393
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,920
yeah a little mind-boggling though yeah

1394
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,359
another one here uh could you put a

1395
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:20,319
micro dot

1396
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,319
on a projector slide and shine it on the

1397
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:25,520
wall to make it readable does that work

1398
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,280
um so in in film in my in my high school

1399
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,839
days i was a film student i was a

1400
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,960
photography student

1401
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,920
and we had uh we had special rigs in

1402
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,400
order to take a 35 millimeter film

1403
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,440
stock and put it onto um put it onto

1404
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,280
like a piece of

1405
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,440
negative paper and the way that you

1406
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,800
would do that is with a thing called an

1407
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:47,760
enlarger

1408
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,680
and so you'd put the the negative in

1409
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,440
mount it inside the enlarger and it's

1410
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,200
basically like an overhead projector

1411
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:53,839
that just

1412
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:56,000
shines light through and projects the

1413
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,440
image larger on

1414
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,880
like a matte at the bottom so uh yes

1415
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,520
the answer is yes you can technically do

1416
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,040
this if you have a large enough

1417
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,480
apparatus to do that um i i

1418
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,760
believe that that i mean that's

1419
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,359
definitely specialized equipment that's

1420
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:12,880
not even something that i think you'd

1421
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,280
find

1422
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,400
in in a standard dark room at a college

1423
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,680
university or anything

1424
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,960
so you can do it um but it's

1425
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,240
you're gonna you're gonna have to find

1426
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,079
some very specialized analog technology

1427
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:24,640
to help you

1428
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,400
do that for sure okay okay okay

1429
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,160
um tracy existed

1430
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,040
i didn't lose any i mean i i lost them

1431
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,800
and refound them so if you want to count

1432
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,640
the times that i lost them

1433
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,319
uh five in the last 12 hours five times

1434
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,800
um in total i i think it was the same

1435
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,440
tricky

1436
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,440
micro dot that i have and i have like

1437
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,559
two of them

1438
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:51,200
so i lost one and re-found it five times

1439
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:51,760
in the last

1440
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,160
12 hours but this is the only the last

1441
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,760
12 hours is the only time i actually had

1442
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:56,800
any loss of them

1443
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,640
so uh i previous to this i was doing it

1444
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,040
with the

1445
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,800
the lick the finger and and debit

1446
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,960
method of micro dot wrangling so it

1447
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,400
worked um

1448
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,520
it's fairly successful great

1449
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,960
a couple people were asking what do you

1450
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,880
think about the idea of a qr code

1451
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,839
on a micro dot model yeah yeah that was

1452
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:18,319
another

1453
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:20,240
that was another kind of digital hybrid

1454
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,079
that i was thinking of

1455
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,800
so you could increase your bandwidth for

1456
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,960
transfer by putting a qr code onto

1457
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,280
microdot and having it

1458
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,000
be readable for somebody maybe who you

1459
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,280
wanted to like

1460
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,720
you wanted to get them information but

1461
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,400
you wanted to um

1462
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,559
give them an added level of security or

1463
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,680
find a way to

1464
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,240
transfer something more information to

1465
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:42,720
them

1466
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,400
you could you could hypothetically do

1467
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,160
this i think it would be relatively

1468
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,079
labor intensive to do that though

1469
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:49,760
because then you they would standard

1470
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,960
technology is not going to be able to

1471
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,400
take a picture of

1472
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,599
a qr code that's in a micro dot so um

1473
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,520
you could potentially know one thing i i

1474
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,119
could try if i wanted to continue with

1475
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:00,720
this experiment is to get one of those

1476
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,200
lenses that you can attach to an iphone

1477
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,240
that will let you take like um micro

1478
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,520
photography

1479
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,839
um that may be something that you could

1480
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,680
do in order to try to get

1481
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,680
a good shot of it i don't know whether

1482
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,960
that would work

1483
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,599
in theory it would work but actually

1484
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:19,680
getting the the qr code to be readable

1485
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,800
itself

1486
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,240
would be um challenging i think yeah

1487
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,280
yeah okay uh then the last question i

1488
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,079
think is uh

1489
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,559
is just the basics like what made you

1490
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:32,160
want to do this

1491
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,280
what did you guys do yeah so so this was

1492
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,440
when i when i i started writing this

1493
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,200
zine called the teletypist about a year

1494
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:39,680
ago

1495
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,440
and the teletypist is just kind of the

1496
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,200
output of all of my work for

1497
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,440
doing uh doing it's a project that i

1498
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,280
call the hacking history project

1499
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,359
so i work with a couple other people on

1500
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:50,720
this and

1501
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,839
the entire intent here is to um put in

1502
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:55,440
freedom of information act requests to

1503
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,720
the government and have them give us

1504
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,800
information back on old hacks and

1505
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,839
old hackers um

1506
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:03,760
i've been fairly successful with this

1507
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,880
and so

1508
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,040
my my goal here was to every year

1509
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,400
publish a new

1510
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,640
um version of the scene with kind of

1511
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,800
updates on the last year's progress

1512
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,880
and there's a kind of an underlying

1513
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,720
narrative structure to it

1514
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,079
but what i wanted to do when i first

1515
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:20,000
started this project was

1516
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,240
to put something that i called added

1517
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,760
value into every

1518
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,160
issue so in the first issue i had an

1519
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,520
rfid sticker

1520
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,119
that if you got one of the physical

1521
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,640
copies you would

1522
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,440
um you would be able to dump the

1523
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,960
information from the sticker

1524
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,520
in in raw form and uh you would be able

1525
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,040
to pull the hex out of it and then

1526
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,400
translate the hex

1527
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,680
um i think maybe one person did this

1528
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:47,119
but it's for my own entertainment so

1529
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:49,040
the reason i started doing this was to

1530
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,800
have some added value for the second

1531
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,200
issue so if you're interested in having

1532
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,640
a micro diet

1533
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,800
uh look out for issue two of the

1534
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,839
teletypist

1535
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:00,640
because there may be some some added

1536
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,359
value

1537
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:04,720
here in this in this pill case um

1538
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,400
when i get around to to actually

1539
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,920
publishing it so that's

1540
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,559
that's why i did it for for fun and for

1541
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:11,920
not profit

1542
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,079
okay great and then uh we'll probably

1543
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:16,319
leave uh maybe with uh just a couple dad

1544
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:17,839
jokes i think we collected during there

1545
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:18,240
a lot

1546
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,880
but i collected a couple of them i'm

1547
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,760
pleased to buy this

1548
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,599
there was a question about what a micro

1549
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:27,440
pac man he didn't eat micro

1550
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,480
dots it was the first one uh and then

1551
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,359
the second one

1552
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,119
and maybe the better one was would

1553
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:34,960
aquarium news articles be stored on

1554
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,599
microfiche

1555
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,680
on the inside yeah right yeah it's uh

1556
