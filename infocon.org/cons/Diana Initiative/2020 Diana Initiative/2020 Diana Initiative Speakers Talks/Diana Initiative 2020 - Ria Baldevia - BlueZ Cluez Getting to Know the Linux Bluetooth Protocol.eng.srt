um to help you on your journey um

72
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,440
playing with bluetooth low energy and

73
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,120
just these little devices that you

74
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,840
pretty much buy at the store

75
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,760
um and so let's go ahead and start this

76
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,120
fun

77
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,360
so i mean bluetooth is everywhere you

78
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,720
have your mobile device

79
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,599
you enable bluetooth there you have your

80
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,879
smart refrigerator

81
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,120
your smart bulbs and then you have a

82
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,000
network in your

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,280
own home that you're building unknown

84
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,040
pretty much by all these things and you

85
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,480
coordinate and automate

86
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,080
what turns on which turns off a lot

87
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,760
color brightness and all that wonderful

88
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,400
stuff

89
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,000
and then you have bluetooth um that's

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,840
enabled even in vehicles and

91
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,519
other items and pretty soon the

92
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,959
bluetooth special interest group is

93
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,040
going to have um audio low energy and

94
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,640
i'm pretty excited about that

95
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,640
because i love playing with music

96
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,799
programming that was my introduction to

97
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,879
stem with music how to program music so

98
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,720
um here we are today playing with blue z

99
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,040
and they are going and we're going to

100
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,720
basically talk about you know

101
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,959
what exactly you can do at home open

102
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,159
source items

103
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,000
hardware that you can get on the cheap

104
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,680
and um actually

105
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,840
you may not need to buy a hardware item

106
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,200
if you have an android

107
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,599
mobile so let's go ahead to our next

108
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,480
slide

109
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,040
um i'm a historian as i mentioned uh do

110
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,560
history and technology

111
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,360
and i i like merging both worlds and um

112
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,319
when i

113
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,400
talked about you know my interest in

114
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,439
bluetooth

115
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,200
with friends they were like well where

116
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,480
did that name come from

117
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,439
and i was like i don't know so let's go

118
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,400
ahead and look it up

119
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,239
and lo and behold the engineer that was

120
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,519
responsible for bluetooth

121
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,000
um is a history buff as well and he was

122
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,798
inspired by a book about vikings

123
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,000
and um the logo actually is a bind room

124
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,840
so it's named after this viking king

125
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,360
during the 10th century

126
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,400
um king harold blochland son

127
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,440
um united scandinavia jim carter came up

128
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,919
with a name in 1997. he was inspired by

129
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,600
a book who's reading about the viking

130
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,080
vikings um basically the symbol

131
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,880
represents

132
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,600
the king's name um also known as

133
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,560
bluetooth

134
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,160
initials and um he also was inspired the

135
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,800
engineer

136
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,919
was inspired by franz benson's longship

137
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,960
book it focused on danish warriors and

138
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,000
who had a

139
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
thing for adventure and then there was a

140
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,759
vikings book that exposed them to

141
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,160
the runic stone and what i find really

142
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,600
fascinating is not only

143
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,440
is the history buff but he

144
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,000
was inspired by the concept of pink

145
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,960
forms

146
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,000
um when he unified scandinavia so he saw

147
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,160
the product that he was building as

148
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,000
something that would unify

149
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,160
you know multiple devices and things

150
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,000
into like some sort of mesh network

151
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,320
and so that's how bluetooth came about

152
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,440
with um

153
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,000
with um with this product and i thought

154
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,280
that was really cool and

155
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,680
i wanted to make sure that you um i

156
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,960
shared it with you if this is the only

157
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,479
thing that you walk away with

158
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,800
after this talk that's perfectly fine

159
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,520
but yeah

160
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,479
bluetooth is named after 10th century

161
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,919
who is responsible for uniting

162
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,840
scandinavia

163
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,320
all right so let's start high level here

164
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,680
we have bluetooth

165
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,639
wireless technology specification is

166
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,199
developed

167
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,240
management published by the bluetooth

168
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,880
special

169
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,919
interest group um they also do that with

170
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,120
blue z um within bluetooth you have the

171
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,080
low energy on the 2.4 gigahertz

172
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,000
bubble and then it used to be called

173
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,120
blue smooth

174
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,720
um bluetooth smart

175
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,280
and in contrast to um classic bluetooth

176
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,479
um it's designed to provide

177
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,319
significantly lower power

178
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,880
consumption so these allows apps to

179
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,800
communicate with ple devices

180
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,600
you have peripheries that you can engage

181
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,039
with connect with

182
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,080
interact with so um that's

183
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,000
pretty exciting and these things are

184
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,520
just getting much more sophisticated and

185
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,319
fun and

186
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,639
um the more you know about them the more

187
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,080
fun you can have with them even at home

188
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,360
if you just want to research what

189
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,160
exactly

190
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,199
do you have at home all right

191
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,759
so after bluetooth low energy let's get

192
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,400
down to

193
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,960
the linux bluetooth protocol stack which

194
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,400
we call blue z

195
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,960
um it's an open source project under the

196
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,000
general public

197
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,759
license so it was developed in 2001

198
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,800
and released in 2001 and then in 2004 it

199
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,199
was handed over to marcel coltman

200
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,520
and then just like bluetooth the

201
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,919
bluetooth special interest group

202
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,680
they um gained maintenance

203
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,240
responsibilities maintainership um in

204
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,680
2005.

205
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,919
so the components when you play with

206
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,840
bluesy or bluetooth little energy such

207
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,479
as the

208
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,880
unique identifiers and all of that stuff

209
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,960
the attributes the characteristics

210
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,840
those still play um with the

211
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,199
specifications that were published by

212
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,599
the bluetooth special interest group

213
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,919
and here you have no tux you can't

214
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,199
forget him

215
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,960
for playing with linux gotta put a heart

216
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,639
there

217
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,319
all right some background information on

218
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,479
the features um blue z

219
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,560
provides support for the four bluetooth

220
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,520
layers and protocols available on

221
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,000
woozy.org

222
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,759
one of the things that i want to

223
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,800
highlight here is that it can support

224
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,759
multiple bluetooth devices let's say you

225
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,000
have

226
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,800
a raspberry pi or a single um processing

227
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,680
board

228
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,360
that has bluetooth 4.1 in it already

229
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,400
if you get a bluetooth usb or a two or

230
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,039
three

231
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,160
and use one of the tools such as the um

232
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,360
the hci

233
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,879
tool you can actually still stand up

234
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,039
all those bluetooth devices they'll have

235
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:21,919
their um

236
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,080
bluetooth device address as well and

237
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,080
then they can actually start scanning

238
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,319
for first so i think that's really cool

239
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,080
um now we're just going to play for this

240
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,280
presentation we're just going to play

241
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:31,759
with

242
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,919
one bluetooth device that's going to

243
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,159
serve as um

244
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,120
the main um broadcaster then then we'll

245
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,679
scan and look for properties

246
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,240
um uzi consists of many separate modules

247
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,440
um we have

248
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,920
things that deal with the um control

249
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,440
interface we have things that do a

250
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,920
protocol decoding and analysis tool

251
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,839
and the three main items that we're

252
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:54,720
actually going to play with are

253
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,920
introduced with but we're going to play

254
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,519
with two main items

255
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,560
are um basically

256
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,680
control bluetooth ctl um

257
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,720
hci config hdi tool and then there is

258
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,760
the gen generic attribute um tool

259
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,640
called gap tool

260
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,920
so platforms and distributions um bluesy

261
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,200
kernel modules

262
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,600
things that basically um you have

263
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,200
libraries utilities

264
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
anything that that you can get your

265
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,880
hands on i mean i'm using the raspberry

266
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,640
pi for this presentation

267
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,200
um distributions anything that's debian

268
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,519
dates i mean for linux

269
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,760
um one of the things that didn't show up

270
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,040
when i

271
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,839
took this from bluesy.org is that it

272
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:38,480
also is

273
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,040
utilized you can use it in cali linux i

274
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,080
had some issues

275
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,519
when i was playing with my espion buster

276
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,040
version offered um for this and i was

277
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,160
like well let me try

278
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,800
my kali linux on my pie and see if that

279
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,880
can work and it turned out

280
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,720
okay it was great because i needed to

281
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,560
use a wire shard anyways a packet

282
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,519
analyzer

283
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,519
and we're gonna go through that too so

284
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,800
here we go we have commands commands

285
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,000
that we're going to utilize or get

286
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,200
exposed to

287
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,680
bluetooth control command line interface

288
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,640
to blue

289
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,120
you have the hdi device configuration

290
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,760
utility

291
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,519
where you will tell the bluetooth device

292
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,079
that you're on to stand up or to shut

293
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,279
down

294
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,000
and then you will utilize the hdi tool

295
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,839
for a low energy scan

296
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,839
um basically once you scan up your

297
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,120
bluetooth device

298
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,360
clip hdi tools i want you to scan for

299
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,560
all the peripherals out there

300
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,920
that are utilizing low energy and then

301
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,399
i added gap tool here interesting about

302
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,600
gap tools the most

303
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,640
recent um up to date

304
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,680
version of um blue z

305
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,480
doesn't download or install gap tool by

306
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,480
default you have to do that um

307
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,480
individually modularly and um that's

308
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,839
available online as well

309
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,920
but not too bad either way you can still

310
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,480
utilize that tool

311
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,600
all right so with applications um before

312
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,079
we get

313
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,160
into these bluesy tools i think it's

314
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,440
important to understand

315
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,720
why these tool sets aren't what they are

316
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,959
um it's because of these characteristics

317
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,040
and the layers that are involved in low

318
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,000
energy so

319
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
with the generic access profile you have

320
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,279
the application layer and then you have

321
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,320
a host layer

322
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,760
and then within that you have the

323
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,360
generic profile

324
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,839
which dictates how devices interact with

325
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,279
each other i mean you have the world

326
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,000
you're the broadcaster you have the

327
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,760
observer you have the central you have

328
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,640
the peripheral

329
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,880
and then you go ahead and have a generic

330
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,320
action profile

331
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,360
which is called gap that establishes how

332
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,079
to exchange all profile and user data

333
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,959
over a low energy connection um and then

334
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,000
you have the

335
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,399
um security manager protocol and the

336
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,040
attribute

337
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,000
protocol um here the actual protocol is

338
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,760
very special that's where the data

339
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,959
gets exchanged and um the logical link

340
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,519
control and adaption protocol the l2 cap

341
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,959
layer is um the routing mechanism

342
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,959
for the action protocol and security

343
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,560
management so when you do some

344
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,480
analysis on packets one of the things

345
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,920
you need to do is make sure that you're

346
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,480
looking

347
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,920
at the packets that contain the

348
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,279
attribute protocol

349
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,200
um and then you have a host controller

350
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,120
interface which basically um

351
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,720
you know it's the interface between the

352
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,639
host and controller and then you have

353
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,959
the link layer and the physical layer

354
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,200
the physical layer um it contains the

355
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,839
analog communication

356
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,959
this thing is on 2.4 and then um

357
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,160
you have the link layer you have to

358
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,480
define the device sending advertising

359
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,360
packets

360
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,680
a device that initiates a connection and

361
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,120
manages it later

362
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,120
and then a periphery device and

363
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,200
advertiser um so basically

364
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,639
that's responsible they're responsible

365
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,880
for the rules there

366
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,360
um so now that we

367
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,800
of what understand the low energy

368
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,800
protocol stack is

369
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,959
let's go ahead and play it with the um h

370
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,440
the host control interface um

371
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,399
tool here um http so we're going to deal

372
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,279
with hci

373
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,079
and general attributes so you go ahead

374
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,160
and let's say you have your raspberry pi

375
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,639
and it has bluetooth in it the raspberry

376
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,560
pi regular pipe for those

377
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,720
those versions come with the um um

378
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,079
bluetooth 4.1

379
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,680
if you have anything under like

380
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,600
frederick ii you may have to get a

381
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,399
bluetooth

382
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,880
usb so let's go ahead and do studio hdi

383
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,680
config

384
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,480
number and then your command so in this

385
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,880
case i have sudo hdi config

386
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,560
hdi 0 my first device i want you to

387
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,480
basically stand up um run that command

388
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,040
go ahead and enter http again and then

389
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,880
your output is the device saying

390
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,360
yeah this is my type of um this is what

391
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,079
i am

392
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,199
this is my address um and i'm up and

393
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:47,760
running

394
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,880
so what do you need to do next

395
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,680
so in addition to the up command you can

396
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,920
tell um them to basically

397
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,760
shut down reset our stack

398
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,279
off encrypt we're not going to use

399
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,519
all of these commands here um what we're

400
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,560
actually going to

401
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,839
walk through is up and down and then

402
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,639
we're not going to do reset but at home

403
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,920
i use those three

404
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,320
i haven't done our stats off no off

405
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,040
encryption

406
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,160
group yet with the hdi config and hdi

407
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,040
tool at all

408
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,240
so go ahead and scan it up um

409
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,880
basically saying that it's down i want

410
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,680
to stand it up

411
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,480
you run that command again and you have

412
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,680
your hci

413
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,839
um zero up and it says yes i'm up and

414
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:34,720
running

415
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,760
fantastic now that my bluetooth device

416
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,040
is up and running i

417
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,880
want it to scan the room

418
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,680
for devices that um basically are low

419
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,480
energy

420
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,199
so here i'm going to use the hdi tool

421
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,360
pseudo hci tool and then dash eye which

422
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,639
basically says hey i want you to

423
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,920
interact with things

424
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,160
um i want i want the first device to go

425
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,839
ahead and scan the room

426
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,800
so when i do that a low energy scan the

427
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,920
alpha will showcase

428
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,880
devices um and i and i should be able to

429
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,600
see my device

430
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,120
there are a bunch of other devices but i

431
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,120
blocked them out so what i wanted to

432
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,600
show you is

433
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,460
yeah they picked up my device um

434
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,639
[Music]

435
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,560
and it provided this address it looked

436
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,000
like a macbook

437
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,320
address and i'm like all right good so

438
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,360
let's go ahead and see if i can interact

439
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,760
so it's important though to note that

440
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,160
hdi tool has been depleted upstream

441
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,880
and if you currently just use hci tool

442
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,560
command without sudo then you'll be

443
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,240
picking up bluetooth classic

444
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,399
so make sure to include pseudo in order

445
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,720
to pick up low energy packets

446
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,240
and make sure that it works with low

447
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,839
energy 4.1 controllers

448
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,399
all right so now that i have the device

449
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,160
address i can connect using

450
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,000
the led light on the under hd tool

451
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
that's one way to connect there's

452
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,759
another way to connect under blue d

453
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,120
which is the blue

454
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,079
control um a bluetooth control is the

455
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,440
command line interface to

456
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,839
z um basically do a pseudo bluetooth

457
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,560
control

458
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,600
i want you to connect to this address

459
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,560
and then if things are okay and you can

460
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,079
connect it gets connected

461
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,519
and it tells you connections that's

462
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,480
successful one thing about low energy um

463
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,759
is that it can't do multiple connections

464
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,240
at once so if i have my phone app on my

465
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,000
scanner on my app connected

466
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,600
to um to my light bulb i need to make

467
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,880
sure that i disconnect

468
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,000
before i try to get my bluetooth control

469
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,240
to um connect between my first device

470
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,320
so make sure you disconnect and it's

471
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,880
only one pension at a time

472
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,440
all right so now what about some generic

473
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,040
attributes we have the clients and we

474
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,320
have the server

475
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,399
so the gap client corresponds to the

476
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,639
eighth

477
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,079
it does not know anything in advance

478
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,240
about the service attributes so it must

479
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,120
first inquire

480
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,399
communication needs to happen and

481
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,880
connections happen and basically i need

482
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,800
you to reveal what exactly is going on

483
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,600
with you

484
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,120
so it must first inform about the

485
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,720
presence and nature of those attributes

486
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,640
by performing service discovery

487
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,480
so what are the primary services that i

488
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,559
can um play with or

489
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,160
if i can't play with it what can you see

490
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,359
what can you feel what are your

491
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,559
characteristics

492
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,400
after completing service discovery it

493
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
can then start reading and writing

494
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,799
if permissions are there for you to

495
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,160
write and read

496
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,280
um found in the server as well receiving

497
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,880
server initiated updates

498
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,640
and then on the server side you have the

499
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,320
server again corresponding with the app

500
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,559
server um it receives requests from a

501
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,320
client and sends responses back

502
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,320
it also sends server initiated updates

503
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,760
when configured to do so

504
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,559
so every a low energy device sold must

505
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,919
include at least a basic gap

506
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,760
server that can respond to client

507
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,080
requests even but only to return

508
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,919
an error response and i'm actually going

509
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,000
to show you that on a screen capture i

510
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,640
got for

511
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,799
on my app when i wanted to scan and

512
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,640
connect with my

513
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,240
um like my smartphone

514
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,360
okay so generic attributes um

515
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,360
it's established in detail how the

516
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,799
change of all profile and

517
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,760
used for data um over a ble connection

518
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,080
it

519
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,039
deals only with actual data transfer

520
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:11,840
procedures

521
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,400
and formats it uses attribute protocol

522
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,160
again whenever you do your packet

523
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,880
analysis

524
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,480
make sure you're filtered down to your

525
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,799
app protocol so that you can actually

526
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,840
see the data or actually um capture the

527
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,559
right request

528
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,799
the right commands and actually get a

529
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,960
glimpse and gleam of the data exchange

530
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,440
so here's a little um table to showcase

531
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,200
how these things are nested within each

532
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,679
other

533
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,840
so the gap servers they have services

534
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,960
within services there are

535
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,799
characteristics like what exactly

536
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,000
do this value do what color of the light

537
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,440
bulbs do you want this to be do you want

538
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,120
to see dimmer do you want to shut off do

539
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,679
you want to

540
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,400
be right or not and basically in that

541
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,679
what are the descriptors

542
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,440
scriptures and values and all those

543
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,960
other attributes so

544
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,160
you have the descriptor at the small

545
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,320
level the micro level and that fits into

546
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,360
the characteristic

547
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,080
um think of it as a container of user

548
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,640
data

549
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,720
and metadata and then you have that

550
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,000
within the service and then when the

551
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,360
service you have that from the gas

552
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,559
server

553
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,760
um this again is taken from o'reilly um

554
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,480
book

555
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,679
um the um intro to um

556
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,080
which is low energy which is a great

557
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,960
primer

558
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,039
um it's not pink and purple in the book

559
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,400
i just made sure everything was pink and

560
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,919
purple for this presentation too

561
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,400
but the logo plus a beautiful color

562
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,120
scheme

563
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,200
all right so now that we have a basic

564
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,400
understanding of what the

565
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,200
generic um attributes are and the

566
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,919
importance of

567
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,760
attributes when it comes to analyzing

568
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,280
the data that's a

569
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,520
um that is being shared between my app

570
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,360
and a smart device

571
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,799
let's go ahead and take a look at the

572
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,799
browsing tool that i

573
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,880
um i thought when i wrote about this

574
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,919
proposal and this

575
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,559
presentation so we have the tool so the

576
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,600
gadget rule is

577
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,360
a way to discover read and write

578
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,720
characteristics with

579
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,760
um this tool onto basically the

580
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,640
um the characteristics and the values of

581
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,360
the attributes

582
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,880
it defines the data structure for

583
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,400
organizing characteristics

584
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,480
and attributes and atlanta and you can

585
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,240
launch natural interactive mode

586
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,679
basically set tool dashboard and then

587
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,600
you basically have all these commands

588
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,679
once you establish the connection

589
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,400
with the address you can say i want you

590
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,440
to reveal

591
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,440
your primary services i want you to

592
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,360
reveal these characteristics

593
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,200
they need known characteristics that

594
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,120
match um specifications

595
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,320
to the fig to the um special interest

596
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,440
group

597
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,120
but if the manufacturer creates this new

598
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,039
requirement or capability

599
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,840
that isn't quite defined by bluetooth

600
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,880
sigs

601
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,880
then these um characteristics can

602
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,760
include customized um identification

603
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,320
they're called unique universal um

604
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,559
identification numbers all right so

605
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,240
what can you do with gachal i want to

606
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,840
know my primary reveal your

607
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,120
characteristics

608
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,520
i want you to read the characteristics i

609
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,400
want you to

610
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,480
i want to write to the characteristics i

611
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,840
want to do a right request for

612
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,360
characteristics i want

613
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,520
scriptures of the characteristics and

614
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,720
then listen

615
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,520
and then we can interact all right so

616
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,280
here i go ahead and go back to my

617
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,120
my initial setup where i have a

618
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,200
pseudogat tool that's an interactive

619
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:13,840
mode

620
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,240
i go ahead and see that it's working and

621
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:16,960
i tell

622
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,960
the um i tell them say hey i want you to

623
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,000
connect to this address

624
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,919
because i want to learn more about it so

625
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,200
i go ahead and tell it connect

626
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,360
to the address and if it's usable

627
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,360
connect and then connect

628
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,440
once that happens i want to say i want

629
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,039
to say what was the primary service

630
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,559
directory so all i do is

631
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,640
primary service and then throughout the

632
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,480
characteristic commands you're going to

633
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,280
see this

634
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,600
attribute um and then you're going to

635
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,360
see the uid

636
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,760
and these are supposed to basically

637
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,880
match up against some sort of

638
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,159
specification some sort of

639
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,799
action if it's been um approved and

640
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,640
normalized by the

641
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,480
special interest group then it's going

642
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,480
to have a a

643
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,039
standard a standard number if not and

644
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,960
it's unique to the manufacturer then

645
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,559
it's going to have a customized

646
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,600
um id

647
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,559
all right so i want to do

648
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,840
characteristics which is much more

649
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,600
robust than primary

650
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,640
um have handles that look like they are

651
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,280
standard specifications from the special

652
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,159
interest group

653
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,320
and then further down it looks like

654
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,320
there is an incremental trend

655
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,039
that doesn't look like it's specified by

656
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,240
the special interest group i mean it

657
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:26,880
looks like

658
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,720
one two three four five six seven eight

659
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,000
nine abcd

660
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,480
1911 and then the next one is 1912 from

661
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,000
1913 1914

662
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,080
and that actually tells somebody like oh

663
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,440
that looks like it's

664
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,640
customized it's been generated um

665
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,559
and it doesn't basically it's not

666
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,320
specified

667
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,960
um it doesn't fulfill a specification of

668
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,120
the special interest group

669
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,640
all right so i bring this up because um

670
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,200
you have several ways to go about this i

671
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,400
approach this by using

672
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,039
an app called the nrf connect you can

673
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,240
download it on your phone

674
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,960
and again it scans and then i found my

675
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,760
device

676
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,840
and i connected with my device and then

677
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,600
it shows me the client

678
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,640
um clients gats and the um

679
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,960
server gas and all these characteristics

680
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,880
um both the specified

681
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,440
um characteristics that match with the

682
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,880
special interest group and then it shows

683
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,559
me the unknown characteristics

684
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,320
that tells me like oh that must be

685
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,840
customized that must be like what the

686
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,799
manufacturer

687
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,720
created and they're not telling me what

688
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,720
it is they're not going to tell me what

689
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,840
it can do

690
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,640
but it has a uid and it has um

691
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,840
submissions defined

692
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,919
some of these are right some of these

693
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,080
are um

694
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,720
read some of these are notified and and

695
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,520
some of these are

696
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,159
right but no response i'm like okay that

697
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,320
looks interesting

698
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,640
so you can also do that with that tool

699
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,919
where you type the primary and the

700
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,440
characteristics like i did in my

701
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,320
previous

702
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,320
um slide on your terminal but i think

703
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,919
the interface is much nicer and pleasant

704
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,919
on my password

705
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,480
okay so when we talk about the universal

706
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,039
unique

707
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,159
identifier a universal unique identifier

708
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:04,919
is a

709
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:08,000
128-bit number that should be unique um

710
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,240
i say you need to probably

711
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,559
should be um and there are two formats

712
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,760
the 16-bit

713
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,559
and the 32-bit um earlier i talked about

714
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,279
how

715
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,559
you know you have the specified

716
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,799
um numbers and characteristics

717
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,039
defined by the special interest group

718
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,960
special interest group and then you have

719
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,400
you know the companies having carte

720
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,080
blanche um

721
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,520
in creating a identifier

722
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,039
because they're creating some sort of

723
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,640
like um

724
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,039
capability or requirement that can be

725
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,880
matched or doesn't exist

726
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,880
um within the bluetooth special interest

727
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,000
group so if

728
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,640
you are basically utilizing something

729
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,240
that has been specified you are allowed

730
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,600
to use a shorter version

731
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,360
the 16-bit if you are customizing some

732
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,120
sort of requirement or capability and

733
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,440
there

734
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,799
isn't um a uid that utilized from the

735
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,080
special interest group

736
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,000
then you would have to use a 32-bit and

737
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,360
that would have to be exposed

738
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,520
whenever somebody does a um

739
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,520
characteristic discovery

740
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,760
so here again to note if a company or

741
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,440
developer creates a new requirement or

742
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,320
capability

743
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,840
that does not fit with any of the

744
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,080
standard uid the custom you

745
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,799
id can be generated and that is actually

746
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:21,600
available

747
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,600
um on that that generator tool is

748
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,279
available on the sig website so all you

749
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,880
bluetooth developers out there

750
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,120
again you can customize your uid

751
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,360
so here standard i have my table divided

752
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,799
into two you have the client

753
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,720
and then you have the server something

754
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,640
that's standard and specified

755
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,840
you take a look at the past hits 2006

756
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,320
now if you have a separate device and

757
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,080
you are actually having these

758
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,159
characteristics you would use the same

759
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,080
uid now if i take a look at the

760
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,240
customize at the client side

761
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,159
it's basically my manufacturer creating

762
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,000
some new requirements and there's that

763
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,880
custom

764
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,279
uuid where it's zero zero zero one zero

765
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,000
two three

766
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,720
four et cetera 1911 and then if you

767
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,600
recall

768
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,919
screen capture it actually has three or

769
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:16,880
four um

770
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,440
other characteristics that went to 12 13

771
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,159
and 14

772
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,200
at the end so these things are

773
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,480
because one of the things you need to do

774
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,120
is in order to um

775
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,000
interact or engage with a low energy

776
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,880
device

777
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,640
that permits somebody to read and write

778
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,120
um onto their service you will need

779
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,240
their id

780
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,080
you will need to understand how does a

781
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,360
handle play into this

782
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,320
and then you're going to need to

783
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,400
understand how the value

784
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,400
is attached to the handle and how the

785
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,440
handle is

786
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,440
linked to the identifier

787
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,000
all right attributes you have type

788
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,039
permissions

789
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,000
value and handle and then you put this

790
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,799
on the table

791
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,240
um basically you have the headset 201

792
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,960
it's identifier on the week identifier 1

793
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,279
and

794
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,840
the commission's read only security

795
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,720
these will actually

796
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,840
show up on a packet analyzer so

797
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,919
just keep these in mind and um it helps

798
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,720
better disable the specific tissues

799
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,080
and um identifying identifiers

800
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,600
all right so the objective here let's go

801
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,440
do a quick walkthrough you want to start

802
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,960
playing with your bluetooth low energy

803
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,000
devices at home

804
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,840
who doesn't i mean you can buy stuff

805
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,279
everywhere and you have your mobile

806
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,080
device

807
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,640
and why not right so my environment that

808
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,080
i'm going to walk through is i have my

809
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,720
blue

810
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,520
to um smart light bulb i have my mobile

811
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,960
app i have a sniffer

812
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,200
i have wire shark and i'm using my

813
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,240
raspberry pi

814
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,960
i use both the valley linux and adress

815
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,080
and operating system

816
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,120
the buster version so my

817
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,320
light bulb is on and i have my app i

818
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,000
have my app and it's communicating

819
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,559
i want to change colors um so basically

820
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:57,600
that's what i'm doing

821
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,159
but i also have my nrf connect app i

822
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,000
find out what my address is

823
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
i go ahead and say well i want to learn

824
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,559
more i want to go ahead and dig deeper

825
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,360
beneath the hood basically what is this

826
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,559
uid what is

827
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,320
unknown characteristic so i'm going to

828
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,000
go ahead and get a bluetooth zipper

829
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,720
um you can do a lot i use the truth one

830
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,360
here

831
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,760
you have an android mobile device you

832
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,120
can do that as well

833
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,480
um just enable the um sniffer

834
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,279
in the developer tool option um adafruit

835
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,640
ellie sniffer there are two boards the

836
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,080
blue one and the black one the black one

837
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,679
is actually version one the blue one is

838
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:32,480
version two

839
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,000
and then you have micro bit if you want

840
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
to play with the tcle jack out in cali

841
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,760
it's also known as the swiss army knife

842
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,640
for bluetooth

843
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,880
leverage the micro bet um they have a

844
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,760
population

845
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,399
adapter um on it and you can utilize

846
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,399
that or uber truth one which is

847
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,320
um a bit more expensive than adafruit

848
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,840
but not too expensive

849
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,200
there are high-end ones that are in the

850
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,960
thousands i don't recommend that you

851
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,559
just get one of these available online

852
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,960
all right so once i snap i go ahead and

853
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,000
feed my packet

854
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,960
to the um water chart and then here i

855
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,760
have my um

856
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,559
raspberry raspberry pi reason i use that

857
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:07,760
debian face

858
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,559
and i need linux and it's easy to use

859
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:11,679
and accessible

860
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,760
i go ahead and light my light bulb feed

861
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,120
information and then

862
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,279
be on my nrs connect get the information

863
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,679
i want and notice that there are a bunch

864
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,360
of unknown characteristics

865
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,039
and i know the permissions most of them

866
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,279
i can write to it but i don't know

867
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,080
anything else i go and get my sniffer i

868
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:28,720
get my

869
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,120
truth one install it and i want to make

870
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,640
sure it's working because sometimes it

871
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,559
doesn't work and see nothing here so i

872
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:35,679
go ahead and pull up

873
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,559
inspection analyzer and i'm like oh my

874
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,320
gosh it works fantastic

875
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,760
you want to make sure that it's pulling

876
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,520
up things that are the two parts i mean

877
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,880
the white lines we need to find wi-fi

878
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,559
you want to make sure things are going

879
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,640
up at the 2.4

880
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,120
all right so let's go ahead i feed my

881
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:53,679
data

882
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,880
on to my um it gets snipped and then it

883
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,240
gets into my terminal

884
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,760
i really don't want to do that because

885
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,919
it's hard to analyze i may miss

886
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,919
it i encountered problems earlier and it

887
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,919
got really frustrating because something

888
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,679
was wrong with the file and

889
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:08,960
i needed to stop because i reached my

890
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,120
limit and there is a way to get it fed

891
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,240
directly into

892
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,600
um wireshark lesson learned here most up

893
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,360
to date a recent wireshark

894
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,240
to um the capture feature and sometimes

895
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,120
it doesn't work

896
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,600
and it's inconsistent using the tmp of

897
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,240
the pipe

898
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,240
but i found things that work with the

899
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,520
pipe um with

900
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,200
you know calling it shark fin so if you

901
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,960
want to learn more about naming pipes

902
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,000
but if i go on linux

903
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,240
there's the website if you want to know

904
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,440
iphone pipes in

905
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,360
wireshark that's the website well as

906
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,960
well but i found these commands that

907
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,799
help and make everything work perfectly

908
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:45,360
fine

909
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,840
so you go ahead um sharp

910
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,360
um short fin you call in wireshark you

911
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,279
tell the uber tooth hey i want you to

912
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,159
start um

913
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,240
sniffing ellie and i want you to i'll go

914
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,240
ahead and send it directly to wireshark

915
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,640
and voila this is what i get i get

916
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,399
protocols that are low energy i get

917
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,959
protocols

918
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,039
attribute here but i want to filter it

919
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,640
because i don't want to be inundated

920
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,360
with so much

921
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,279
things i don't need so much noise so i

922
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,559
go ahead and filter it down to the d2l

923
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:20,240
um um here and if you recall earlier the

924
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,640
presentation the reason why it's l2 cap

925
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,799
that's actually transport the on the

926
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,760
routing um

927
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,360
mechanism for the protocol that actually

928
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:29,760
posts

929
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,159
the data that data gets exchanged so now

930
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,440
that i've filtered it and i get the

931
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,960
protocol that i want

932
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,399
i'm like all right let's go ahead and

933
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,880
look like requests

934
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,000
i go ahead and do that and i get my

935
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,200
information here

936
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,519
i get information about the bluetooth

937
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,279
low energy link clearer

938
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,880
i get information about the bluetooth

939
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,799
ltcap protocol and

940
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,720
the one i want to deal with and expand

941
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,000
is a bluetooth action

942
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,159
protocol because that is where i am

943
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,360
going to get the service

944
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,600
we need identifier information that is

945
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,399
where i'm going to get the

946
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:01,279
characteristic

947
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,600
duid and that's also where i'm going to

948
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,880
get the value

949
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,320
that contains the action um

950
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,919
that i want to edit all right so now

951
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:12,640
that i have that

952
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,440
information what exactly do i want to do

953
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:15,760
i

954
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,840
am going to basically utilize the blue

955
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,640
z tool um such as bluetooth control you

956
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,159
can do that or gat tool

957
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,960
um for that tool so with the blue z tool

958
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,080
i have here

959
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,519
um call it up connect to my bluetooth

960
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,480
workflow tell it to connect it's success

961
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,519
fantastic

962
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,120
i want to go ahead and select an

963
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,039
attribute name attribute

964
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,440
and then i want you to read or write you

965
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,799
have to have permissions to do that

966
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:43,519
though

967
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,159
and then if i want to use gap tool in

968
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,519
order to do those edits

969
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,919
i call and get tool set in interactive

970
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,640
mode go ahead and connect to the address

971
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,000
and once it tells the connection is

972
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,320
successful i go and tell them

973
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,440
say hey i want to do a character request

974
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,559
handle basically the hex that contains

975
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,240
the action i want to deal with

976
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,320
and then the value so i want you to go

977
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,320
ahead and do a right request

978
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,640
to this handle let's say zero zero one

979
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,200
two and i want you to change it to the

980
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,559
color

981
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,080
you shop so if you

982
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,080
are excited about it as i am obviously

983
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,399
i'm still very very excited about it

984
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,080
um here are some sources for you to get

985
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,760
started so you've got

986
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,640
blues you've got gastrul hci tools

987
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,320
all of these are discussed um as a

988
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,080
primer and a foundation in

989
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,440
getting started with bluetooth little

990
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,840
energy tools techniques for full power

991
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,640
networking

992
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,840
by kevin thompson um even robert

993
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,640
davidson

994
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,080
and then you have the iit hackers

995
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,000
handbook a practical guide to hacking

996
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,080
the internet of things by teaching

997
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,679
and then adafruit there are a bunch of

998
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,440
learned tutorials there that can help

999
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,640
you work with

1000
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,600
either the fruit ellie sniffer or even

1001
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,200
with uber truth one

1002
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,519
and then you have the blue z dot website

1003
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:00,320
itself

1004
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,640
and a bunch of other tutorials online

1005
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,440
but i'm

1006
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,880
really excited about sharing my love

1007
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,800
my love for bluetooth energy with you

1008
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,918
and i hope

1009
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:12,399
this has inspired you to get involved

1010
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,079
and just start tinkering and playing

1011
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,359
with all the devices that you have at

1012
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,000
home already

1013
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,800
so dave um i'm ready to take any

1014
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,119
questions

1015
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,839
all right um thank you so much this has

1016
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:30,320
been

1017

really fabulous so how long um

1018
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,879
how long have you been doing this how

1019
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:37,679
long have you been

1020
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,560
sort of in this discovery process oh my

1021
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,599
gosh it's been about

1022
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,520
um trial and error it's been over a year

1023
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,599
um so i started last

1024
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,679
year and i was like well okay what else

1025
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,280
can i do i started buying the hardware i

1026
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,639
started exploring it adafruit

1027
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,599
but then i also found that the thing

1028
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:57,920
that

1029
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,359
took the most time was how to know which

1030
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,839
version know which version to utilize

1031
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:04,400
and what

1032
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,680
has been deprecated and

1033
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,599
if it's been deprecated can i still use

1034
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,680
it

1035
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,560
with the um with all the actual hex

1036
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,560
values and all of that and with pdu

1037
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,280
and all that um you know what exactly is

1038
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,320
the structure

1039
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,560
with the bits and the headers and then

1040
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,839
the payload

1041
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,079
but um other than that it's been a

1042
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,680
one-year journey so far

1043
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,520
just trying to work set up my

1044
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,440
environment get comfortable with the

1045
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,720
operating system

1046
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,480
and identify which sniffer is the best

1047
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,400
for me and also with wireshark

1048
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,760
you know it's gone through its own

1049
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,320
iteration so i it's taking a while

1050
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,800
but i like i like failing forward i like

1051
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,599
learning

1052
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,599
and it's been fun um i appreciate that

1053
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:50,000
uh

1054
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,480
this is root this is the time for folks

1055
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,599
in the room

1056
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,359
to go ahead and uh submit your questions

1057
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,920
i did post a survey link

1058
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,680
and then we've got a great question from

1059
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,359
kim crowley um

1060
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,079
are there lots of iot devices with the

1061
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:06,640
linux

1062
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,240
bluetooth stack on it

1063
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,359
so i mean the linux bluetooth

1064
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,400
stack i mean when it comes to operating

1065
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,000
system

1066
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,160
i mean with raspberry pi's or raspbian

1067
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,119
operating system

1068
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,680
like if it's a linux operating system

1069
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,240
already

1070
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,400
the bluetooth bluesy should be there

1071
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,800
already

1072
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,400
right um so

1073
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,560
you've been in you've been in this for

1074
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,079
around a year

1075
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,280
um tell me what are the what are the top

1076
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,560
two or three tips that

1077
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,920
uh ria of today would give

1078
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,520
to rhea a year ago

1079
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,960
um set up your lab at home so that

1080
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,960
you are um your environment is

1081
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,680
accessible

1082
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,079
and you have no option but to interact

1083
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:00,720
with it

1084
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,160
also the ria today knowing it's 2020 and

1085
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,520
there is covid and

1086
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,440
this is our environment you will have to

1087
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,640
interact with it

1088
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,400
but also um just go straight to kali

1089
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,119
linux

1090
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,440
you know don't worry about setting up

1091
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,880
your virtual box

1092
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,400
um with ubuntu or mint like just

1093
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,800
go for kali linux i mean it comes with

1094
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,880
wireshark already it comes with a btle

1095
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,000
jack already

1096
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,960
and um yeah just go ahead and just start

1097
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,760
early and

1098
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,240
get your hands dirty and you know you

1099
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,599
can't really expect

1100
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,480
i never really expected to learn and

1101
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,040
pick up

1102
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,599
anything within a week or two weeks or a

1103
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:40,400
month like

1104
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,760
i learned by failing and um yeah just

1105
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,359
do it and document so three things

1106
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,200
just go straight to cali set up your

1107
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,760
environment and document

1108
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,040
so you can um not you but

1109
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,920
a person a person can get it into this

1110
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,119
space

1111
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,320
we're not talking about a million

1112
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,880
dollars here we're talking about

1113
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,040
uh a few components

1114
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,880
you could you could set up what would

1115
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,480
you what do you think you could set up a

1116
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,320
lab for less than three hundred dollars

1117
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,760
if you wanted to

1118
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,560
yeah like um all operating systems are

1119
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,680
downloadable

1120
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,240
you can get a raspberry pi like four now

1121
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,359
with amazing

1122
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,079
like ram capabilities for like 50 bucks

1123
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,160
or raspberry three for 35

1124
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:30,640
um the blue fruit sniffer at adafruit

1125
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,280
like get the blueboard updated one

1126
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,560
that's like 35

1127
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,960
and then the ubertooth or 35 or 40

1128
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,440
dollars and the ubertruth is like 135.

1129
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,040
and you don't need all of them like just

1130
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,760
choose one and

1131
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,839
and play with it if you have an android

1132
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:46,960
mobile device

1133
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,160
there's actually a developer um setting

1134
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,280
enable the bluetooth low energy

1135
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,320
sniff capture and there you go like two

1136
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,359
things in one

1137
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:58,880
and you can basically do a data dump

1138
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,400
onto your um

1139
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,480
to your host and start analyzing that

1140
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,720
way or convert it to a pcat file and

1141
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,240
send it to wireshark

1142
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,240
i only discovered that i could use micro

1143
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,400
bit by accident i actually got a micro

1144
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,040
bit board

1145
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,440
two three years ago and i only found out

1146
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,200
recently that i can use it as a sniffer

1147
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,240
because my uber tooth

1148
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,920
originally wasn't working and i started

1149
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,839
panicking no

1150
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,920
so um yeah there are things out there

1151
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,359
that are available if you have a mobile

1152
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:24,800
devices android

1153
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,720
take a look at your developer settings

1154
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,240
if you can um

1155
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,440
spare like 35 40 dollars take a look at

1156
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,720
adafruit um

1157
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,200
bluefruit sniffer if you want to go uber

1158
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,000
choose one

1159
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,160
and play with you know a great spot like

1160
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,280
those gadgets

1161
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,560
go ahead and like save 135 but it's it's

1162
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,200
accessible and it works like raspberry

1163
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,480
pi's are fantastic

1164
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,240
operating systems are free yeah

1165
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,079
okay can you comment at all about

1166
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,359
um online communities or forums

1167
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,400
that folks particularly beginners

1168
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,520
might might think about using um

1169
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,720
or just hanging out and and lurking and

1170
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,760
listening from

1171
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,400
any suggestions there i would just

1172
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,680
probably go to them

1173
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,960
learning um modules not learning logical

1174
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,680
learning like

1175
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,640
sub sites on adafruit for one i

1176
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,520
basically go

1177
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,480
to the documentations for like raspberry

1178
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,359
pi

1179
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:26,480
or even forums that focus on wireshark

1180
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,079
because that's really helpful

1181
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,920
um but like interactive chat rooms i

1182
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,280
don't have a list of that

1183
