i'd like to give you a brief overview

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,040
today of the challenges facing the u.s

election system in 2020

40
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,399

so here you'll see my biography to

42
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,200
answer the basic who am i don't bother

43
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,280
reading it it's in your thing

44
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,000
um here's a better picture of me a

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,439
little bit more recent than the one

46
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,880
i've been spreading around so basically

47
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,640
i've been election security for about

48
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,920
10 years now um got into it back

49
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,880
in 2010 with a little company called

50
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,000
clear ballot group

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,840
i was with them a little over a year

52
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,520
when i became basically an auditing

53
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,239
specialist

54
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,959
um as their operations manager uh after

55
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,959
that went on to do a few more uh cyber

56
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,400
security startups but stayed in the

57
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,560
election security uh world

58
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,319
and uh did some pro bono work in the

59
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,640
meantime for example for california and

60
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,760
colorado

61
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,440
uh which is listed in there i've worked

62
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,080
with numerous states uh to advise them

63
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,040
on uh their security offerings uh for

64
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,360
for

65
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,560
uh elections and um most famously

66
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,440
recently

67
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,959
as i mentioned became one of the

68
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,720
organizers for the defcon voting machine

69
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,760
hacking village

70
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,239
which uh just took place remotely uh

71
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,400
last week

72
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,959
so i guess the next question would be uh

73
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,160
why am i doing this

74
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,400
uh besides just speaking with you today

75
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,000
because i enjoy it

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,720
um one of the things that people often

77
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,840
ask is kind of you know how did you get

78
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,519
into election security it's a little bit

79
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,599
esoteric up until recently it was not a

80
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,159
very

81
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,920
um known or even well

82
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,040
people didn't even know it existed

83
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,519
really as a concern uh i certainly

84
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,319
met my fair share of glazed looks but i

85
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,280
truly um

86
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,400
am passionate about this field and uh

87
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,319
one of the um how do i say this

88
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,480
one of the reasons is uh because i it's

89
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,080
a great confluence of being civically

90
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,680
involved while also

91
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,360
you know using my cyber security

92
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,599
expertise but i actually prefer when

93
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,720
people ask why do you care about

94
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,040
election security to quote a movie

95
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,319
which has a animated raccoon in it what

96
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,159
has the galaxy ever done for you

97
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,680
why would you want to save it because

98
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,400
i'm one of the idiots who lives in it

99
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,720
so as i mentioned there's a a little

100
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,640
breakdown in my bio leading up to

101
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,560
uh the defcon village again no need to

102
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,560
read it but basically um

103
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,480
i truly believe that all activist

104
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,159
measures all anything that's policy

105
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:54,879
based uh

106
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,000
really has voting at its center of as a

107
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,879
linchpin

108
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,200
uh basically if elections can no longer

109
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,239
be trusted to be

110
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,560
democratic uh and to represent the will

111
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,439
of the people

112
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,840
a lot of other good things we can try to

113
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,280
do in the world kind of go out the

114
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,439
window because now you're at the mercy

115
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,599
of maybe another nation state which may

116
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,720
not have the best uh

117
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,320
your best interests at heart maybe

118
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,600
someone domestically who doesn't have

119
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,040
your best interest at heart and as i'm

120
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,079
going to mention later

121
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,320
if we don't solve some of these problems

122
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,240
any random script kitty who doesn't have

123
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,639
your interests at heart

124
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,800
um so one of the things that happens

125
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,160
when we're talking about election

126
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,000
security is it's very easy and i do this

127
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
all the time to just kind of go off on a

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,440
bazillion different tangents because

129
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,759
elections are extremely complex

130
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,240
um technically they kind of begin if you

131
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,880
want to talk about the

132
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,080
you know where does an election begin

133
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,680
and where does it end you could kind of

134
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,360
say it begins with the founding of

135
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,320
democracy

136
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,000
uh and a government i really like that

137
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,600
when i was an archaeologist in a past

138
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,560
life and that's a

139
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,880
ostracos or a ballot for uh pericles of

140
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,680
athens

141
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,919
uh that we still have today really cool

142
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:56,800
uh

143
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,400
but really what we have and i have to

144
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,680
thank the sister of the buddha judge

145
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,440
campaign that was on it i cam uh on a

146
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,880
talk with recently because he put this

147
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,759
very nicely

148
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,479
which is a three bucket problem which is

149
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:06,960
that

150
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,199
you have campaigns influence operations

151
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,880
and election infrastructure and i know

152
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,400
from personal experience that it's

153
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,199
really easy

154
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,800
to start talking about one of these and

155
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,479
then just sort of go off in a million

156
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,840
different tangents but those are

157
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,080
actually three pretty distinct silos of

158
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,199
how we talk about

159
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,320
election security so while campaigns and

160
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:24,960
protecting

161
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,840
uh campaign um campaigns from uh

162
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,440
overseas influence or attack

163
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,199
is an incredibly key thing and while

164
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,960
influence operations is an enormous

165
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,520
problem

166
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,160
which i wouldn't even which is we're

167
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,680
gonna mention a couple of times but it's

168
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,080
just

169
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,160
so out of my wheelhouse that i can only

170
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,440
stand in awe of those who

171
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,960
have to deal with it every day we're

172
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,720
gonna actually focus on the center one

173
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,680
there the election

174
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,600
infrastructure question uh that's kind

175
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,960
of my bread and butter it's what i feel

176
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,919
best um

177
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,440
you know capable of talking to you guys

178
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,039
about but i can kind of answer questions

179
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,160
about the other ones that they come up

180
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,039
in the q and a

181
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,560
session uh which is going to be a little

182
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,560
spin off at the end after this

183
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,639
so um as i was saying elections

184
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,639
very complicated kind of begin with when

185
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,080
the campaign or issue

186
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,639
is put out there uh to be voted on and

187
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,319
they sort of end

188
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,720
way way way later with the peaceful

189
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,319
transition of power

190
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,440
from the loser anybody can say i was the

191
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,400
winner of the race

192
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,960
give me give me power losers are the

193
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,400
ones who have to accept

194
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,639
that democrat uh the democratic process

195
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,759
worked out

196
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,840
uh and that they and their followers

197
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,240
need to step peacefully aside and that

198
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,080
is the real promise of a

199
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,440
of a democratic society um so

200
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,000
in between all that you've got so much

201
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,520
we're going to barely scratch any of the

202
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,759
surface of this but everything from

203
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,319
uh voter registration voter backend

204
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,440
voter you know election

205
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,240
management sign up times lines voting

206
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,120
machines uh

207
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,960
who's allowed to vote are they voting

208
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,560
legally we will touch on that

209
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,479
uh you know how do we deliver the ballot

210
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,080
can we get it there in time

211
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,080
uh how is it counted how do we make sure

212
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,919
that the counting was done properly

213
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,919
uh how do we certify the results how do

214
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,440
we report the results how do we make

215
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,639
sure that people don't

216
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,800
uh read false information about the

217
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,880
results all of that any single one of

218
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,080
those things could be

219
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,840
hacked and it would technically be

220
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,199
election hacking

221
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,280
um but it's probably not what first pops

222
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,720
into people's minds because what usually

223
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,919
pops into people's minds when we talk

224
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,520
about election hacking

225
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,840
is the election machine tabulation

226
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,759
happen tabulation is really

227
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,280
only a very small part of the process

228
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,080
so um one of the things i like to also

229
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,599
bring up and this is kind of

230
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,800
um kind of get your all in the right

231
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,520
head space

232
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,360
so one of the fun challenges that we

233
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,520
face in election security is

234
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,880
um if you're building a threat model

235
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,560
which i'm sure many of you have done one

236
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,520
thing you might do

237
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,960
potentially uh is think about

238
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,840
who would potentially want to attack

239
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,960
your target

240
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,639
and the very fun thing about us

241
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,319
elections is the answer

242
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,960
is well everyone foreign government

243
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,599
official

244
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,080
domestic foreign political operatives or

245
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,199
domestic ones

246
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,919
foreign activists or domestic ones

247
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:04,800
foreign criminals

248
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,960
domestic criminals and if we don't

249
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,400
address these vulnerabilities

250
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,720
foreign and domestic scrip kitties are

251
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,639
also on the table so basically

252
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,919
every single person on earth has a

253
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:16,720
motive

254
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,039
to uh impact the us elections would

255
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,879
stand to have something to

256
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,680
gain and right now we are i don't want

257
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,120
to disparage any colleagues here but

258
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,000
let's just say

259
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,319
that until quite recently election

260
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,199
security in the

261
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,199
u.s was treated with about the same

262
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,200
level of technological sophistication as

263
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,559
the county fair

264
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,839
uh so we are trying to address that

265
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,200
um and uh the problems are huge and

266
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,839
numerous

267
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,640
and extremely slow moving uh just to

268
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,320
give you an example uh

269
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,720
we uh why we can't just address all of

270
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,080
this quickly overnight

271
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,839
we have 54 sets of election laws

272
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,279
individually in the u.s because the

273
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,519
states run their own elections

274
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,480
uh and the territory so that's if a

275
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,160
state is the one who's the only one

276
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,519
responsible for running their election

277
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,360
sometimes it's down to the county level

278
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,040
sometimes it's down which is uh by the

279
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,640
way 3 000 counties and then sometimes it

280
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,480
goes below that so it can be over

281
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,680
to the township level which could be

282
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,640
over 5000 individual locations which

283
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,399
each have their own machinery

284
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,560
their own way of doing things their own

285
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,399
administration and we have the largest

286
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,920
number of ballot options anywhere so i

287
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,880
just want to quickly say

288
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,480
if what's percolating your mind right

289
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,920
now is why don't we just

290
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,640
pass a law and fix it or um why don't we

291
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,120
just

292
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,040
do what this other country does it's

293
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,040
really not in the cards because of how

294
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,120
massively complicated by design

295
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,399
american elections are um

296
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,920
one thing i would also quickly point out

297
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,000
because again pass a law just have dhs

298
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,640
step in

299
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,720
um the federal government has actually

300
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,560
no control over u.s elections

301
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,600
by design uh they are fragmented uh they

302
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,720
are a strict

303
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,880
states right and this unless you should

304
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,240
think oh well we'll just ask the states

305
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,680
very nicely to hand over their cyber

306
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,040
security management to the federal

307
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,320
government obviously they'd want to do

308
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:58,800
that

309
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,959
um no not even slightly they

310
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,160
vociferously guard

311
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,680
uh this right to manage their own

312
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,880
elections and we're seeing a little of

313
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,760
that conflict

314
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,440
uh right now so whatever the federal

315
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,800
government says all they have power to

316
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,320
do is offer money

317
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,880
um or support or advice uh which the

318
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,399
states can and often do

319
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,959
turn down so uh before we get too bogged

320
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,480
down here uh

321
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,079
so quick quick quick history lesson um

322
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,320
it all kind of goes back to the florida

323
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,079
2000 election that's when the cyber

324
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,839
security community began to kind of take

325
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:28,399
a look

326
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,000
at election security issues in the

327
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,320
united states um

328
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,720
in that uh it's kind of the origin of

329
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,839
well it's certainly when a lot of people

330
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,760
myself included watched it on aol and

331
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,959
one first went oh my god

332
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,519
what's wrong with our elections um this

333
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,880
led to something called the help america

334
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,519
vote act

335
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,279
uh and this was billions of dollars put

336
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,880
into the election

337
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,360
uh u.s elections to basically shore up

338
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,480
and modernize

339
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,760
unfortunately no cyber security uh

340
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,440
was well frankly cyber security was a

341
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,920
sci-fi concept at the time but

342
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,320
no um limitations were put into how the

343
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,120
states could run

344
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,720
their own election there was no strings

345
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,720
attached and this led to a thing

346
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,720
many people have heard about uh which is

347
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,120
the uh dres which is the touch screen

348
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,240
machines which are so

349
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,000
um you know that election security

350
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,600
people love to hate they leave no trace

351
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,279
they have no receipt somebody could just

352
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,160
go in there

353
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,839
uh change the numbers around and there

354
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,079
would be absolutely no way to trace it

355
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,360
why not look at the logs well these

356
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,880
things don't often keep logs there's

357
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,200
just

358
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,720
myriad problems with these things it

359
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,600
almost makes you miss the hanging chad

360
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,800
um

361
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
so the wide adoption of dre machines led

362
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,560
to growing alarm in the cyber security

363
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,680
community in the mid

364
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,880
mid arts um which eventually led to some

365
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,079
a couple of really great studies

366
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,160
including the everest report and the

367
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,680
ohio top to bottom review i'm having to

368
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,120
give a link to these uh afterwards in

369
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,519
the q

370
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,079
a uh and this is uh led to you know the

371
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,600
whole cyber security community election

372
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,320
cyber security

373
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,800
community in general which eventually

374
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,000
leads to

375
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,079
uh 15 years later the def con voting

376
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,760
machine hacking village where we got to

377
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,120
get into the guts of things after the

378
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,839
dmca limitations uh which had previously

379
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,440
prevented good faith hacking efforts

380
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,880
except under extremely

381
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,600
uh uh difficult circumstances uh which

382
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,959
is a tale for another day

383
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,040
we discovered that zero of these

384
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,360
vulnerabilities have been patched uh

385
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,480
so this is normally where my

386
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,079
talks would be kind of focused on we

387
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,839
could spend a whole hour just talking

388
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:18,480
about

389
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,160
um the relationship between vendors and

390
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,839
election security in the united states

391
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,360
and all of these problems um

392
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,600
but we also have and then we would you

393
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,120
know talk about the solutions right in a

394
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,160
normal year then we'd talk about the

395
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,600
solutions uh we talked about paper

396
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,040
ballots a return to paper ballots which

397
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,760
is basically

398
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,560
a secure anonymous way to record the

399
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,600
voters intent

400
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,000
we can look at it afterwards um things

401
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,360
have been improving in this space i

402
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:41,920
think we were

403
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,480
at one point at 13 states that had dre

404
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,440
or mixed dre

405
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,880
uh mixed in with their paper ballot

406
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,639
optical scan now we're down to like

407
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,279
eight

408
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,600
um so great progress there lots of

409
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,800
reasons to be optimistic

410
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,000
the other thing that we've been pushing

411
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,440
for is a thing called risk limiting

412
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,120
audits it's a statistical audit you can

413
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,560
see the flow chart there

414
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,480
uh where statistical magic basically

415
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,720
allows us to uh choose random ballots

416
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,120
and

417
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,839
certify that the election uh went as it

418
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,120
was supposed to basically the voting

419
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,560
machine did its job

420
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,760
correctly um and uh

421
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,360
what we wanted with this is the quickest

422
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,560
cheapest it was made by a great guy

423
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,519
called philip stark

424
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,519
it's the quickest cheapest way uh that

425
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,120
we can implement if we're lucky maybe by

426
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,360
2025 we'll have it in place where

427
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,000
uh every single race uh goes through

428
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,360
this risk limiting audit so there's no

429
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,880
threshold there's no you didn't get four

430
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,959
percent or five percent you know

431
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,279
uh so you're not allowed to ask for this

432
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,320
um

433
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,519
because of course you know the inherent

434
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,680
risk there would be uh oh uh if it's

435
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,079
under

436
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,079
and this is true by the way if if the

437
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,680
person wins by over one percent for

438
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,320
example

439
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,079
um they then we're not gonna have a

440
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,600
recount there's nothing suspicious well

441
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,360
if i'm a criminal right then i'll just

442
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,120
make sure i win by two percent if i have

443
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,399
that level of control

444
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,480
so um risk limiting audits are to raise

445
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,920
the floor of security

446
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,920
on paper and can only be done with paper

447
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,440
ballots um

448
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,480
and basically allow us to before

449
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,920
the authentication period before the

450
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,600
certification period is over

451
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,040
to certify that the election um was

452
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,279
uh chose the right winner that the the

453
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,240
um the

454
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,839
machine acted correctly and everything

455
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,839
went well so we were really pushing for

456
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:12,320
these

457
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,839
a lot of states are moving forward like

458
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,519
colorado rhode island with these

459
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,600
it's really great the colorado

460
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,120
especially has been fantastic

461
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,360
um so this is again normally what my

462
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,480
talk would kind of

463
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,240
be very focused on is explaining or

464
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,920
swimming audits paper ballots things

465
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,760
like that

466
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,199
um but then of course there's no

467
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,399
problems there's always new problems

468
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,880
right

469
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,560
lately it's been ballot marking devices

470
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,160
now if you are a denizen

471
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,240
of the nerdier parts of the election

472
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,680
security twitter stream

473
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,040
you may know that there's been a great

474
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,560
deal of fighting over ballot marking

475
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,440
devices

476
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,680
uh which is basically we had just

477
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,440
managed to start push making this push

478
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,959
for paper ballots and then the vendors

479
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,040
came out with a new problem for us

480
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,000
which is computer marked ballots uh

481
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,199
which

482
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,800
uh a university of michigan study

483
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,320
discovered uh

484
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,920
may just bring us right back to square

485
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,360
one because

486
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,959
people don't actually check their ballot

487
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,199
after it's been printed by this machine

488
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,800
so uh that basically means now you can

489
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,880
just attack the way that the machine

490
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,560
fills out its little paper ballot it

491
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,920
gets dropped into the box the voter

492
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,639
doesn't check it

493
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,160
it could also be falsified and now risk

494
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,920
limiting audit will no longer save you

495
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,959
because you can't go

496
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,040
to a accurate record of the voter's

497
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,560
intent so this has become a huge

498
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,279
flashpoint

499
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,040
and you may have seen things like paper

500
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,040
ballots now or hand counted paper

501
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,079
ballots now

502
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,120
or more to the point um

503
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,519
hand marked paper ballots um so i'm

504
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,399
gonna quickly say

505
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,920
no you don't want hand counted paper

506
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,839
ballots our elections are too huge

507
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,320
too complex humans lie and are very bad

508
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,279
at counting

509
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,079
so let's just quickly say no please no

510
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,440
hand counted paper ballots

511
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,399
but also hand mark paper ballots so some

512
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,000
election experts i'm going to quickly

513
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,120
explain the drama here

514
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,560
some election security experts kind of

515
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,639
got in trouble with the activist

516
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,320
community because they weren't

517
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,720
um saying loud enough and simply enough

518
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,399
hand mark paper ballots for everything

519
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,680
and the reason we don't do that is

520
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,759
because disabilities are still a thing

521
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,519
the reason that marketing devices were

522
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,360
justified was a people are bad at

523
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,800
filling out their ballots and

524
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,880
the vendors were hoping to capitalize on

525
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,079
this concern but

526
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,399
b people with disabilities exist and

527
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,920
they also need to vote

528
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,320
and if you have motor control issues or

529
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,279
vision issues

530
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,199
uh you can't just do a hand marked paper

531
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,480
ballot necessarily

532
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,800
in your home and this is um its own

533
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,160
concern and one that election security

534
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,959
experts are very

535
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,880
worried about so we are always what

536
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,079
we're trying to do is have the

537
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,360
um we're not trying to say no ballot

538
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,519
marking devices ever and this is kind of

539
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,120
where the uh flashpoint was

540
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,720
we're just saying that we would like to

541
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,240
keep ballot marking devices in this sort

542
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,440
of assistive technology

543
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,480
to uh to the people who need it and keep

544
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,320
handmark paper ballots to those uh to

545
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,519
whom that is an option

546
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,079
uh and hopefully uh that and therefore

547
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:44,880
keep the um

548
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,480
the the ballot marketing devices this

549
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,759
extra level of technology which could

550
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,880
have inherent risks

551
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,040
um siloed and protected and given uh the

552
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,399
scrutiny deserves to keep it safe

553
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,920
because if you give it to everybody

554
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,680
we have even more problems than we had

555
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,079
before and we have so so many problems

556
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,800
like we have a lot of newer problems for

557
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,600
example

558
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,240
you may have heard of it covid19 so all

559
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,679
this stuff that i normally be talking

560
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:06,240
about

561
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,919
right out the window we have new

562
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,359
problems and so so many

563
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,640
new problems this year uh for example

564
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,760
how are we gonna protect our poll

565
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,959
workers like me

566
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,079
this fall uh also how are we gonna

567
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,359
protect our voters

568
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,720
as you may have seen from this tragic

569
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,559
case in wisconsin uh

570
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,880
when voters uh were standing in line for

571
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,319
hours the height of the pen well

572
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,679
who knows what the height of pandemic is

573
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,679
anymore but um these are

574
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,360
major concerns which have just thrown a

575
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,520
wrench into everything

576
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,600
um the good side i guess if you could

577
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,120
say it is that there will be more paper

578
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,320
ballots that we can go back to

579
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,720
so hey less of that dre concern a little

580
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,960
bit the bad side

581
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,320
everything so

582
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,840
what is the newest problems now

583
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,440
originally when i proposed this talk i

584
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,880
do apologize i was going to go over the

585
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,400
findings in the defcon village this was

586
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,240
back in february when i proposed this

587
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,160
um you know what if you want the link to

588
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,360
the defcon reports if you can't find

589
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,640
them on your own we can discuss them

590
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,919
later i'll get them to you you can read

591
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:00,799
them on your own but

592
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,120
really we have much bigger newer

593
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,080
problems

594
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,760
this slide is one that i was even

595
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,080
hesitant to fill in because as of today

596
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,000
which is about a week before the diana

597
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,080
uh conference when i'm uh you know

598
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,200
recording this

599
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,320
uh we have a new

600
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,840
just as you know new thing happening

601
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,919
every day so by the time you see this it

602
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:20,320
might

603
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,520
already be out of date so

604
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,080
uh we have things like chaos at the us

605
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,000
postal service we have the chronic lack

606
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,760
of funding and yes it is way too

607
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,520
late for long-term planning in this

608
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,440
regard that was spring when we needed

609
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,160
this money for

610
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,919
to implement widespread mail and voting

611
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,600
it is now fall money would still be

612
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,280
great but the long-term planning we

613
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,000
wanted to do

614
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,840
that's in the past uh poll worker

615
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,600
shortages most poll workers are over the

616
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,960
age of 65.

617
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,720
uh as you may know those people are the

618
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,240
most evidence for covet and are

619
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,600
reasonably speaking protecting

620
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,799
themselves so we really

621
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,559
really need young people people who are

622
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,799
less at risk to step up or those long

623
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,559
lines that may have infuriated you in

624
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,600
the news recently

625
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
will just get longer because there

626
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,039
aren't it's not necessarily malicious

627
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,559
sometimes there just aren't enough

628
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,200
people

629
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,200
to staff all of the polling places and

630
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,280
that's why we need poll workers we need

631
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,679
volunteers more desperately than ever

632
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:10,960
we've also got things like

633
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,880
for influence campaigns those never went

634
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,400
away in fact we've done very little to

635
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,320
address them since 2016.

636
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,160
uh and those are going to be a huge

637
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,520
concern uh

638
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,600
we also have domestic and misinformation

639
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,520
campaigns uh from the top down

640
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,120
we've got people giving misinformation

641
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,799
about voting which is another huge

642
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,240
concern election security experts are

643
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,400
having to deal with on a daily basis now

644
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,760
and just so so much more in fact there

645
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,360
might be a new thing by the time you see

646
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,960
this

647
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,760
we are very exhausted uh there are some

648
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,880
preventable new problems i'll try to be

649
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,480
quick about this internet voting

650
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,160
sometimes brought up as a solution it is

651
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,080
not a solution we do not want it for a

652
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,679
lot of reasons it's not the same thing

653
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:48,880
as online banking

654
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,400
uh there was a great quote from ron

655
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,240
rivest where and matt plays where they

656
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,760
basically said it's like somebody saying

657
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,880
we put a man on the moon

658
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,200
so why can't we put a man on the sun and

659
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,720
then insisting that if you don't put a

660
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,080
man on the sun that you're just not

661
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,280
trying hard enough

662
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,039
uh and that you just need to understand

663
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,880
why we so badly need a man to land on

664
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,360
the sun

665
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,120
the thing is the technology does not

666
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,520
exist to be both authenticatable

667
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,840
and anonymous and the anonymous ballot

668
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,520
the secret ballot is a key part of

669
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,320
elections

670
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,000
now maybe some people feel very secure

671
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,520
in where they are but there's plenty of

672
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,120
reasons why you might not want your

673
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,840
in-laws or your boss or your future boss

674
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,240
or

675
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,799
a big tech corporation or the government

676
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,400
to have a record of how you

677
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,720
personally voted uh that they could

678
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,520
trace

679
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,880
back to you so because we could have

680
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,000
voting uh by the way we could have

681
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,760
internet voting tomorrow if you were

682
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,640
okay with just

683
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,480
online banking style of oh yes hi it

684
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,400
looks like my vote was recorded

685
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,039
uh let's um oh yes sir let's go and fix

686
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:43,440
this

687
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,280
um it says you were voted purple party

688
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,880
but i see you wanted orange party let me

689
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,320
fix that right now

690
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,000
now that if we had that we could do that

691
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,280
right away but the thing is there's

692
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,720
plenty of reasons which i just re

693
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,840
listed that we don't want to do that now

694
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,000
again unless people should say uh you

695
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,120
just don't want it hard enough

696
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,720
if you figure out this solution you have

697
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,280
created truly anonymous online currency

698
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,480
because you'll be able to give somebody

699
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,320
a dollar and walk away and it can't be

700
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,120
traced back to you

701
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,360
that person is going to be a billionaire

702
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,600
so no it's not a matter of just not

703
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,039
incentivizing things

704
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,240
enough it's just not possible uh at

705
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,840
least not for decades and whoever comes

706
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,480
up with it they're gonna be very rich

707
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,760
uh there are a couple things that are

708
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,280
not actually problems gonna wrap this up

709
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,960
hopefully they'll give me an extra two

710
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,520
minutes

711
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,200
uh since i'm moving the q a elsewhere

712
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,120
but not actually problems

713
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,679
voter fraud it is a common partisan

714
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,200
talking point there is little evidence

715
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,720
to support it in any statistically

716
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,080
relevant numbers

717
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,880
um the even the most vociferously

718
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,799
partisan studies which have been

719
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,720
searching for it have only been able to

720
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,919
find very small numbers uh the

721
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,480
loyola law school did uh say 1 billion

722
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,280
votes cast between 2000 2014 they found

723
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,799
31 credible cases that's it a five-year

724
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,320
study on voter fraud by the george bush

725
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,480
administration found 86

726
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,880
after a five-year multi-million dollar

727
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,120
study and in both of those instances

728
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,919
the vast majority were just um people

729
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,280
felons who didn't know they weren't

730
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,080
allowed to vote

731
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,799
in that state um and by the way it

732
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,400
varies from state to state so that is an

733
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,600
easy problem to have

734
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,000
there is no evidence of widespread or

735
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
organized voter fraud it is a

736
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,720
myth and it is a myth used maliciously

737
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,159
for voter suppression

738
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,240
the other thing is mail in voting not

739
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,600
really a problem we've been doing it for

740
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,960
over a hundred years

741
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,120
um i don't want to say because i don't

742
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,400
want people to you know my own community

743
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,520
jump down my throat that it has

744
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,880
no security risk but i'll say they're

745
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,559
very old security risks they're ones

746
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,080
that we're very familiar with this isn't

747
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,440
ones and zeros being flipped in a

748
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,320
machine where we need

749
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,240
a forensic cyber security expert to come

750
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,440
in and see if a machine has been

751
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,159
tampered with

752
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,679
this is things like people taking

753
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,360
ballots out of your post box

754
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,679
uh this is things like coercion where

755
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,520
like an abusive household member uh

756
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,039
forces the other people in the household

757
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,720
or the nursing home or some location to

758
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,120
vote

759
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,840
in a certain way um these are things

760
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,240
like

761
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,360
um uh um

762
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,200
uh i had a list here but i can't find it

763
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,640
right now but anyway these are all

764
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,000
problems where if you call up a cop and

765
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
say hey somebody just raided my post box

766
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,280
uh you know you don't have any problem

767
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,400
explaining it to them it's all very

768
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,679
clear and straightforward so it's not

769
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:12,159
like

770
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,000
there is no risk associated with mail

771
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,919
and voting but it's extremely localized

772
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,919
it's extremely clear it's a problem that

773
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,120
we have been dealing with

774
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,039
for over 100 years uh so it really is a

775
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:23,600
very

776
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,120
i have to assume bad faith effort right

777
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,720
now to cast dispersions on melon voting

778
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,919
and by the way mail and voting absentee

779
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:28,720
voting they're

780
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,520
functionally the exact same thing um

781
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,080
what to expect in 2020 well i have one

782
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,320
more minute of your time please don't

783
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,600
freak out

784
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,360
results may not be immediate uh actually

785
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,440
they may take weeks because some uh

786
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,600
states don't have it that the ballot has

787
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,799
to arrive by election day they have it

788
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,960
so that it has to arrive as we postpart

789
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,720
by election day which could mean at the

790
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,799
current rate uh one or two weeks before

791
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:51,919
all of those can be certified and

792
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,520
counted this has already happened in

793
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,279
california and new york primaries

794
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,559
it could be a while and this time period

795
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,240
is going to be extremely rife

796
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,799
uh fertile ground for uh conspiracy

797
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:03,600
theories

798
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,080
so uh lawsuits could uh slow things

799
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,000
further really nobody right now is i

800
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,520
mean nobody right now is looking forward

801
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,720
to what could happen on

802
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,760
nov the night of november 3rd um so

803
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,240
please

804
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,760
don't panic stick to trusted news

805
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,159
sources avoid social media hysteria and

806
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,640
uh and be ready to be patient and what

807
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,559
can you do personally as an individual

808
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,440
vote

809
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,440
you should not take anything i'm saying

810
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,279
is a reason not to vote you should vote

811
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,760
harder if you can because large margins

812
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,600
make it easier to detect fraud people

813
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,159
voting

814
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,400
uh make it easier to detect if something

815
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,679
has gone wrong

816
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,919
furthermore those misinformation

817
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,360
campaigns those psyop campaigns have

818
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,960
been talking about are spending millions

819
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,080
of dollars foreign

820
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,559
and domestically to dissuade people from

821
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:45,919
voting every year especially young

822
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:46,720
people

823
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,279
if you disenfranchise yourself you are

824
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,880
saving those people money and

825
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,360
why on earth would you save the bad guys

826
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,799
money make them spend

827
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,679
every dime so go vote don't

828
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,360
disenfranchise yourself don't do the bad

829
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,039
guys work for them and if you can

830
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,960
please uh sign up to be a poll worker we

831
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,159
desperately desperately need them right

832
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:05,679
now you'll generally make about 200

833
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:06,880
for the day and you meet your members of

834
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,960
your community it's really nice uh

835
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,760
most years uh also again check your news

836
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,279
sources don't spread misinformation if

837
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,559
you are a company and you're thinking

838
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:15,760
wow i really want to get in on this

839
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,039
election cyber security thing it seems

840
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,559
to be going gangbusters right now

841
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,240
uh talk to an expert please there's a

842
