52
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,920

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,920
and i work for an i.t security company

and security research and this is kind

58
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,239
of a story about how i transitioned how

59
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,480
i went from being a stay-at-home mom

60
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,959
into an infosec career just a little

61
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:19,840
side note that

62
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,239
will hopefully make the talk make a

63
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,840
little bit more sense as you can see on

64
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,200
my cover slide

65
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,360
i also worked for a very long time as a

66
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,080
character performer so i worked

67
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,599
with a character visit company and i

68
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,599
would go to parties on events

69
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,920
dressed up as different characters like

70
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,599
elsa as you can see here

71
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,680
and that kind of inspired the title of

72
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,879
my um

73
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,680
my talk for or one of her most recent

74
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,760
songs that came out with frozen two

75
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,280
um so um please excuse my nerdiness with

76
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,319
that

77
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,000
i do love disney references

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,280
so another side note

79
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,920
is i'm very much a people person so i'm

80
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,840
not used to giving a talk like this so

81
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,080
please bear with me if i'm awkward

82
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,319
i will try my very best not to be

83
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,400
awkward but i can't make any promises

84
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,879
because i can be awkward so

85
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,879
i will do my best but here we go

86
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,640
i thought the best place to start would

87
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,239
give you b to give you guys

88
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,519
a little overview a little uh background

89
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,400
and information

90
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,959
a little preface to the story so you

91
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,319
guys can kind of see

92
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,560
where i came from and make things make a

93
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,280
little bit more sense hopefully

94
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,599
i grew up in virginia until i was 12

95
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,879
then moved to texas

96
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,840
i grew up with three brothers um with a

97
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,440
dad who was an engineer

98
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,519
um or at least i thought he was my

99
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,360
father i just recently found out

100
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,319
that he's not actually my father but yay

101
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,879
23 me christmas gifts

102
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,760
um but my real father is actually a

103
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,599
teacher and he's really cool too

104
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,920
but growing up with an engineer as a

105
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,360
father i

106
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,720
learned to look at the world a little

107
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,519
differently i love to take things apart

108
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,239
understand how things work and really

109
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,120
challenge myself

110
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,319
and push myself i mean it didn't i mean

111
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,400
having three brothers as well challenged

112
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,599
me a lot

113
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,599
i was always chasing after them trying

114
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,720
to do what they did

115
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,519
wanting to climb the same trees and ride

116
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,639
the same bikes and

117
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,720
they might have been riding away from me

118
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,880
or climbing the same trees but

119
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,960
i think it was part of the game and i

120
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,639
still did it so

121
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,280
um no but really i had a great childhood

122
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,400
in that sense

123
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,160
that i was pushing myself constantly

124
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,960
and i went to college and i wanted to be

125
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,520
an engineer

126
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,960
and about two years into college i got

127
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,759
married and

128
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,800
got pregnant and i was 20.

129
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,280
um i'm not sure i recommend that to

130
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,400
anybody

131
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,440
but my daughter changed my life

132
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,160
as i'm sure most parents know how that

133
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,880
goes

134
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,600
so i started to change my goal there i

135
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,240
started to

136
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,479
invest in her and wanting to spend my

137
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,320
life teaching her how to be a

138
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,000
responsible human being to

139
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,320
be a contributing member of society my

140
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,759
goal from when she was a baby was for

141
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,000
her

142
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,720
to need me less and less every day and

143
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,000
become a strong

144
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,199
and independent beautiful human being

145
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,320
and that started to work i taught her to

146
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,919
read i taught her to write

147
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,199
and she was growing up she started to

148
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,199
learn to play cello

149
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,520
and then she got older and she didn't

150
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,199
need me every day

151
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,080
and so i started to realize you know

152
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,520
it's time for me to figure out what i'm

153
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,039
gonna do with myself now

154
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,800
i could pick up where i left off i could

155
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
go back to school

156
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,680
and i had to figure out what i wanted to

157
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,680
do

158
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,120
i decided that going back to school

159
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,759
wasn't for me i'm not i do think

160
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,360
that there are definitely people who

161
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,919
need degrees and that it can be amazing

162
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,360
and i love learning as you'll find out

163
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,320
later on

164
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,240
but i do think that there's also things

165
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,160
that you can't learn in school and that

166
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,919
sometimes that experience and just

167
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,759
getting out and doing what you want to

168
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,720
do

169
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,720
is great um and i i know in america that

170
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,880
we put a lot of emphasis on training and

171
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,080
degrees

172
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,600
and certifications and i'm not saying

173
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,520
those are bad at all

174
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,960
i just i just know that often people

175
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,479
feel bad when they don't have these

176
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,600
things but i want to encourage you

177
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,360
if you don't have a degree that's okay

178
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,199
especially in this community especially

179
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,240
in infosec

180
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,720
you can train yourself you can teach

181
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,520
yourself you can

182
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,400
learn step by step um and so i just want

183
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,240
you to know that that's possible

184
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,280
um so as i was trying to figure out what

185
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,639
i wanted to do with myself what i wanted

186
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,479
to do with my life

187
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,240
i started doing something i was

188
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,680
passionate about

189
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,919
i started getting into working with a

190
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:48,800
non-profit

191
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,840
that focuses on bearded dragons i was on

192
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,199
the board of this nonprofit when it

193
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,880
started i helped create it i helped

194
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,720
build and write the bylaws

195
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,319
and it was something i was passionate

196
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,160
about helping these animals

197
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,240
these are pretty common pets and they

198
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,400
are the coolest lizards

199
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,960
and if you don't agree you can fight me

200
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,160
um

201
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,520
but really they they're really amazing

202
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,639
animals but they have

203
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,360
needs that other animals don't have like

204
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:15,759
uv

205
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,599
lights and calcium supplements and when

206
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,120
they don't have them they

207
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,199
can get severely disformed and

208
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,560
disfigured and we see

209
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,120
so many animals like this that need help

210
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,960
and that need people to be educated and

211
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,360
to

212
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,960
understand what they're taking care of

213
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,319
when they get these cute little baby

214
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,599
lizard

215
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,520
um and so i got passionate about that

216
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,880
and

217
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,800
one of the other board members owned i.t

218
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
security company and he saw my passion

219
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,680
he saw these qualities that came out

220
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,240
while i was doing this and said you know

221
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,440
i need someone to do business

222
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,160
development

223
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,360
and you can talk to people and there

224
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,720
aren't a lot of people in i.t that can

225
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,240
talk to people

226
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,400
which is kind of cliche and there are a

227
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,759
lot of people in i.t that can talk to

228
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,960
people but

229
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,960
um it was something that he saw my

230
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,960
passion and i was doing something i was

231
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,479
passionate about

232
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,479
and so i started my career in infosec

233
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,879
and i've kind of prepared some points

234
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,560
here that i think that i hope you guys

235
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,720
can take away

236
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,800
something from this and what i hope can

237
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,560
kind of

238
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,120
help you along your way or encourage you

239
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,400
in your infosec

240
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,560
career path um

241
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,639
the first thing i ran into was

242
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,720
experience i didn't have experience in

243
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,440
this

244
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,199
um i didn't have experience with

245
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,719
computers very much at all

246
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,719
i mean heck i use the same password on

247
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,320
every site and i don't think that

248
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,200
qualifies me for any sort of infosec

249
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,599
award except for maybe the worst infosec

250
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,039
personnel ever

251
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:48,000
um and so i needed to get experience but

252
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,839
as i went through this job and as i

253
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,920
learned and i trained myself

254
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,519
and my company trained me i was able to

255
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,440
find these areas that i didn't think

256
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,279
applied before these jobs

257
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,800
that i had when my daughter was in

258
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,200
school because i only wanted to work

259
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,040
while she was at school and i was home

260
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,320
when she was home so i worked as a

261
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,600
substitute teacher

262
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,200
and i worked as a um

263
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,000
as a instructor at a ceramic studio and

264
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,200
then of course i worked at these

265
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,560
character visits

266
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,000
and i would go to these parties and

267
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,760
perform as kids

268
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,560
and there are so many skills that i had

269
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,000
that i didn't even realize

270
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,360
applied um for example

271
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,279
when i do social engineering jobs when i

272
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,600
go on um

273
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,440
a tactical social engineering mission

274
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,279
and i have these goals to accomplish in

275
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,200
these roles to play

276
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,880
it's just like being a princess except

277
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,360
for the people believe you more

278
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,000
and they're less skeptical i mean the

279
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,839
kids are great and they come up with

280
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,519
some of the most amazing questions to

281
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,560
ask you

282
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,519
and they will be skeptical occasionally

283
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,360
but you have to answer

284
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,440
quickly you have to know exactly what

285
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,560
you're going to say

286
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,440
and you're going to have to be

287
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,640
believable and you're going to have to

288
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,800
believe it and they will believe it

289
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,440
and i think that was one of the best

290
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,720
trainings i could have had for social

291
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,839
engineering because

292
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,959
it's kind of tough sometimes and also

293
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,440
i haven't mentioned i don't know if

294
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,160
anybody

295
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,480
here has tried to wrangle a party of

296
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,440
kids

297
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,040
um and 15 kids in a room from ages four

298
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,519
to eight um and keep them entertained

299
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,519
for an hour when they have a whole bunch

300
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,000
of sugar in their systems from cake and

301
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,519
candy um that is also a skill that you

302
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,720
can't just learn in school

303
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,959
so learning to manage people is

304
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,560
something that you kind of got to get an

305
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,160
experience you just got to get on the

306
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,760
job

307
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,839
and so that's just how i could found

308
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,160
ways that different things i did

309
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,519
to be applied in my infosec career

310
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,000
and coming back to being passionate

311
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,279
about something

312
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,279
um that's something i think that you

313
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,880
guys could take away from this is

314
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,160
learning finding something you're

315
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,200
passionate about if you're passionate

316
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,959
about infosec

317
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,480
um volunteer add little

318
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,640
different conferences like def con or

319
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,720
the here at diane initiative

320
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,560
if you can do that people will see your

321
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,079
passion that will bring out your best

322
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:08,720
qualities

323
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,240
people will see the things that you're

324
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,839
good at and that

325
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,360
will inspire companies to hire you

326
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,680
i know inside we'd much rather hire

327
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,880
someone with the right mindset the

328
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,800
determination the people who want to be

329
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,600
a hacker

330
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,040
who have the right mindset the

331
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,120
determination and creativity

332
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,279
and then we can train them to do a task

333
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,959
but you can't train someone to have the

334
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,640
mindset you can't train somebody to have

335
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,760
the passion

336
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,680
either have it or they don't so that's

337
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,040
why i just

338
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,800
if you can get out there do something

339
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,040
that shows your passion

340
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,600
and that will show the best qualities of

341
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,360
you

342
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,839
another problem i had when i started was

343
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:46,880
i had no

344
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,360
idea what i was doing and i mentioned

345
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,959
this before i had the same password

346
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,000
everywhere

347
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,839
i didn't know about computers or

348
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,040
security so

349
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,839
my um the owner of the company sat me

350
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:00,639
down

351
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,760
and he got a big dry erase board and he

352
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,279
started with the osi layers

353
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,000
and it was a long four hours i think i

354
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,680
had a headache by the end of

355
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,839
and i still didn't understand anything

356
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,360
at the end i still had no idea what i

357
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,839
was doing

358
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,160
but i figured out enough so i could do

359
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,360
business development

360
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,920
and i was excited and i started to learn

361
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,480
i

362
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,880
started to change my habits i learned

363
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,839
how security can be easy in my life

364
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,160
and i continued to learn as i went and

365
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,519
that's what i think everybody here can

366
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:29,839
do

367
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,360
you can learn as you go you don't have

368
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,440
to be the best you don't have to know

369
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,519
everything before you start you know

370
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,800
just get started do

371
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,760
find any job in infosec you know i

372
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,519
started with business development

373
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,680
and i pushed myself i learned i asked

374
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,600
questions you can ask questions to

375
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,639
people and

376
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,680
learn um and hopefully be respectful of

377
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,639
their time

378
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,399
i know i probably wasn't always but i

379
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,920
tried um

380
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,680
and you just need to do it this is a

381
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,399
picture of me after when defcon i

382
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,399
went and i bought a badge and i wanted

383
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,560
to learn to solder and so i went to my

384
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,240
um mentor and i said hey

385
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,880
you know how to solder i got this badge

386
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,399
can you teach me how to solder

387
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,880
and he said sure and so i came to his

388
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,480
really cool soldering station

389
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,680
get a um everything i needed and he goes

390
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,720
okay

391
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,880
here are the instructions here's the

392
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,040
soldering station

393
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,639
don't burn yourself and don't mess up my

394
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,000
stuff and i was just like

395
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,680
okay so i learned and i

396
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,160
looked it up and i read the instructions

397
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,760
and i think this is a dark

398
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,800
net badge but i i learned and i showed

399
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,480
him and he would make corrections and

400
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,839
then finally he kind of gave me an

401
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,440
example once i kind of figured it out my

402
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,399
way but

403
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,000
i really think that some of the best

404
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,440
teachers are people who force you and

405
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,920
push you to figure it out yourself

406
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,760
and just learning as you go don't feel

407
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,120
like you need to know what to do ahead

408
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,120
of time before you just start doing it

409
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,880
you need to just push yourself do what

410
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,399
you need to do and you will learn along

411
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,240
the way

412
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,320
and that leads me to the next point is

413
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,600
you should push yourself outside your

414
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,519
comfort zone

415
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,839
i know it's so cliche to say you know

416
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,360
when you're outside your comfort zone

417
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,120
that's where the magic happens

418
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,440
and that's where you find your true self

419
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,320
but i think there is some truth to

420
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,760
the importance of pushing yourself

421
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,680
outside your comfort zone though

422
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,760
because that's what trains your brain to

423
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,440
be able to handle situations that you're

424
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,639
uncomfortable in

425
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,079
when you make yourself uncomfortable on

426
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,279
purpose you learn to adjust faster

427
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,320
you learn to figure yourself out and how

428
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,040
to

429
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,040
deal and cope with the stress and cope

430
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,560
with not knowing

431
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,000
and the fear of failing and

432
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,560
i think that's so important that i've

433
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,320
purposely tried to push myself

434
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,959
put myself in situations where i'm not

435
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:47,839
comfortable

436
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,839
this is a picture of me doing flying

437
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:50,880
trapeze

438
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,120
and i was scared i thought i would fall

439
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,360
i wouldn't be able to hold on

440
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,279
but it was so much fun and i was so

441
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,760
happy that at the end of it

442
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,000
and so i started in my career pushing

443
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,199
myself to do things that i was

444
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,399
uncomfortable

445
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,960
signing up for talks like this one um

446
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,399
[Music]

447
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,040
because i knew that it was important and

448
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,440
as i go i'm finding myself doing things

449
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,160
i never thought i could do things that i

450
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,519
never would have before

451
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,120
thought and it happens little by little

452
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,480
each time you make yourself

453
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,000
uncomfortable you grow

454
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,839
and you make yourself into a stronger

455
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,160
person

456
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
so i just encourage you find a job that

457
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,839
makes you uncomfortable

458
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,279
find a job that you're not always in

459
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,639
your comfort zone where you're learning

460
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,240
that you're having you're forcing

461
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,519
yourself to learn every day or else

462
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,360
you'll be swallowed whole

463
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,079
and that is where you will grow the most

464
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,560
if you know what's happening in your job

465
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,160
i would i would challenge you if you're

466
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,079
watching this if you feel comfortable in

467
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,600
your job and you know what to do every

468
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,040
day and it's boring

469
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,440
find a different job that challenges you

470
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,279
push yourself find another job or you

471
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,880
you in the community if you want to stay

472
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,800
in infosec if that's what you're in

473
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,120
that makes you work hard that you feel

474
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,240
like you don't know what you're doing

475
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,600
and you have to try harder

476
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,880
every single day and you know

477
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,800
as i started doing this as i was pushing

478
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,120
myself as i was learning

479
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,720
i started to have fun um and

480
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,320
i know i said before that i love

481
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,079
learning and like having fun

482
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,680
but i was and i

483
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,199
started signing myself up for talks

484
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,720
i started loving to getting passionate

485
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,160
again going back to that finding

486
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,120
something you're passionate about

487
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,480
passionate about teaching people about

488
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,440
security

489
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,880
because this was something that changed

490
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,880
my world personally these were things

491
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,079
that i always thought were

492
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,320
so complex that i didn't understand or

493
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,160
that didn't apply to me

494
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,440
or that it would just make my life

495
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,519
difficult and that's not what security

496
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,160
is

497
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,000
security makes your life easier if it's

498
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,079
done right and

499
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,000
i started doing talks around the valley

500
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,440
because i really want

501
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,519
people to understand what i can see now

502
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,199
i started to have this gift

503
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,240
where i could take a technical idea

504
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,040
and translate it make this bridge across

505
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,240
from the technical

506
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,480
and the non-technical and teach people

507
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,839
what i could understand

508
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,000
in a way that they would understand it

509
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,679
so i started to do these talks around

510
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:10,480
the valley

511
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,160
i would do lunch and learns and

512
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,520
different talks about different

513
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,959
ideas to help them learn about security

514
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,640
to get passion about security to be more

515
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,319
secure in general

516
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,559
and just to think a little differently

517
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,599
and understand that

518
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,280
security will help them it's not just

519
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,199
going to hurt them and it applies to

520
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,079
them

521
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,080
and so i mean if you're listening and

522
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,520
you want a security talk

523
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,559
in las vegas area or surrounding

524
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,559
let me know i'm your person i would love

525
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,720
to do it um i would come in i would do a

526
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,520
talk

527
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,880
um teach people about security because

528
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,640
that's something i'm passionate about

529
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,600
um and often i would sign up for these

530
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,480
talks

531
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,919
and i would just pick a subject that i

532
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,480
was excited about and i would have

533
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,320
no idea what i was going to talk about

534
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,600
and i wouldn't even understand the

535
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,400
subject

536
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,240
and then i would research it and that's

537
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,760
where i got to learning that

538
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,520
by teaching other people it would teach

539
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,840
me by forcing myself

540
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,200
to find a subject that i didn't

541
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,000
understand i would force myself to learn

542
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,679
that subject

543
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,480
my first talk was on passwords and i

544
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,240
already told you before

545
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,720
i had the worst password policy before i

546
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,720
used the same password over and over and

547
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,840
over again

548
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,039
um and that's what i researched first

549
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,640
because it made such a huge difference

550
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,240
in my life to be able to have a password

551
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,120
manager

552
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,880
and that security could be easier and

553
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,160
that i wouldn't have to remember all

554
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,360
these passwords

555
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,480
and i could teach other people that um

556
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,160
and i know i said i could give talks for

557
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,760
you guys earlier and you might change

558
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,039
your mind now that you know that i kind

559
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:37,919
of

560
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,320
figure it out as i go but i promise i'll

561
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,320
be ready in time for the talk

562
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,559
um but it became something i love to do

563
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,000
to research things and to learn more um

564
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,720
and i sense that have given this talk

565
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,160
again there were people

566
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,320
there that were way more technical than

567
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,760
me that i was so surprised that they

568
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,039
would ask me

569
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,160
um some technical questions

570
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,919
and i realized that we often

571
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,039
um compare ourselves our weaknesses with

572
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,640
other people's strengths

573
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,919
or we put people on this pedestal what

574
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,600
we think that they know

575
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,520
and because they're good at one thing

576
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,960
that they must be good at all things and

577
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,559
we compare ourselves to that

578
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,200
and it's so not fair that we should be

579
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,480
realistic in that and

580
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,160
and find our strengths find the things

581
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,840
that we're good at in our

582
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,640
our qualities that make us special and

583
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,640
that we have that passion that shows our

584
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,520
best qualities and

585
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,039
focus on those things um and

586
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,880
as i've done this and as i've learned

587
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,080
more and i've

588
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,640
done this talk other times um i've added

589
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,160
more to it i've added sections for

590
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,200
developers

591
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,559
for people to uh focus on

592
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,240
as they're developing these applications

593
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,000
as they're developing these systems

594
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,799
to make the security built in don't rely

595
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,559
on the user to be secure

596
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,480
you take the responsibility on yourself

597
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,360
and it was so fascinating to me to learn

598
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,600
how to do that how to make it secure so

599
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,039
i could teach other people

600
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,240
even developers and

601
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,600
of course there's still things i don't

602
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,679
know and i'm never afraid and

603
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,120
i think that's another thing to mention

604
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,200
is you should never be afraid to tell

605
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,240
somebody you don't know

606
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,919
but you can figure it out or you can

607
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,520
find someone who does know and answer

608
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,640
that question for them

609
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,120
so that leads me to my next point is to

610
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,840
never give up

611
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,760
and i know in this field there is so

612
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,960
much to learn

613
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,320
i know there have been times where i

614
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,480
felt like i there was no possible way i

615
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,840
would ever know what i want to know and

616
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,760
i should just give up now

617
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,919
that i would go to talks in meetups

618
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,679
where there would be so many things that

619
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,280
i wouldn't understand

620
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,840
highly technical ideas and i would just

621
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,000
be so frustrated

622
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,919
that people were there that understood

623
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,440
and i didn't understand

624
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,840
and it wasn't fair and so i would write

625
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,720
down

626
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,400
the things that i didn't understand and

627
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,840
i would go look them up

628
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,919
and i would research them later and try

629
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,200
to figure out what they meant and put

630
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,240
the pieces together

631
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,400
little by little and i started to

632
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,320
realize over time that i have

633
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,000
things i'm good at that other people

634
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,919
aren't and if you have that right

635
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,000
mindset that determination to figure out

636
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,880
things

637
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,799
and to use your qualities and your

638
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,120
strengths to your benefit

639
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,520
that you can take yourself to the next

640
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,440
level that you can do the job that

641
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,640
you're meant to do

642
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,039
and love doing it i know that i'm not

643
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,320
going to be a pen tester

644
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,320
not because i couldn't do it ever

645
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,840
because it doesn't make sense for me

646
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,960
and my passion and my qualities um

647
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,360
and so i focus on the things now that i

648
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,400
can do

649
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,320
the research the security and adding to

650
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,039
what other people need the different

651
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,240
mindset and the different way of

652
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,200
thinking

653
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,799
that adds value to my company to my team

654
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,799
um in other ways other people wouldn't

655
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,080
so find your niche

656
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,039
find your sweet spot and your passion

657
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,320
focus on that

658
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,400
and if you can i think one other thing

659
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,240
that i would want to add that would help

660
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,480
is to find a mentor if you can and when

661
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,400
i say a mentor i mean someone who pushes

662
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,039
you

663
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,000
who challenges you i know there's so

664
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,880
many times

665
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,840
when i was so frustrated with something

666
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,240
that i knew i would message my mentor

667
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,640
i'd be like hey how do i do this and i

668
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,919
knew he knew

669
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,480
and he did and he would just tell me try

670
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,520
harder

671
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,799
and those two words were so frustrating

672
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,559
um that would be like on the verge of

673
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,120
tears but i knew

674
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,960
if he told me to try harder just like

675
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,880
with my climbing in the gym

676
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,880
that there was a way that that route

677
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,480
could be climbed that if other people

678
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,000
could climb it i could figure out a way

679
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,799
to climb it

680
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,120
and when he told me to try harder i knew

681
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,320
that i could do it

682
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,600
and i just needed to try harder so find

683
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,280
someone who pushes you find someone who

684
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,480
encourages you

685
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,080
and hope that they put up with you

686
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,600
because i know there are many times

687
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,280
where i've asked these questions

688
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,679
that made this happen um that would take

689
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,600
hours and hours of explanation where i

690
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,120
just wanted to understand how something

691
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,880
worked and i really appreciate the time

692
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,919
