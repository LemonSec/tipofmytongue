00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,560
sorry i was in the chat okay hi everyone

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,840
thank you so much

28
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,520
for coming to my talk so it's gonna be

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,119
a very um okay so think of this talk

30
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,159
as like the cliff notes abridged

31
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,000
like bullet point version of uh richard

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,600
richards hoyer's uh psychology of

33
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,880
intelligence analysis

34
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,360
and and his other book structured

35
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,640
analytic techniques

36
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,920
so uh it's it's basically you know a

37
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,840
very condensed version of that with a

38
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,040
little bit of a

39
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,040
cheerio twist so

40
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,240
be forewarned really quick i

41
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,360
am not speaking on behalf of my

42
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,880
of uh my employers uh basically all of

43
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,360
everything that i'm saying is my opinion

44
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,200
and my opinion alone

45
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,240
and it does not uh represent those in my

46
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,200
employers

47
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,600
and i'm speaking on my own individual

48
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,239
capacity

49
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,800
so really quick what i'm gonna go over

50
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,760
um

51
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,760
uh if you can't tell hopefully by the

52
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,440
end of this slide deck you'll see that i

53
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,040
love beyonce

54
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,400
i mean who doesn't love her and i'll

55
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,520
talk a little

56
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,360
bit about cognitive biases and fallacies

57
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,319
some solutions um i've read a lot of

58
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:30,879
stuff

59
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,480
and been exposed to a broad range of

60
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:34,800
stuff

61
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,720
not just tech related so i'm bringing

62
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,720
that to this talk as well

63
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,120
and some crowd surfing if you're lucky

64
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,680
so as beyonce says put a ring on it

65
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,879
um i'm saying that you guys

66
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,480
basically already kind of do

67
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,959
a form of cti analysis when you're

68
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:57,599
performing

69
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,440
uh blue team related activities and so

70
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,640
uh i'm just asking that you

71
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,959
commit to being a maybe a little bit

72
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,400
more conscious

73
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,159
of your analysis and potentially using

74
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:12,800
some of the

75
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,040
tips and techniques and tricks that i

76
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,920
share

77
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,840
in this particular talk so

78
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,159
i think about thinking like that's so

79
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,319
meta right

80
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,599
and basically it boils down to uh this

81
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,120
is of course from

82
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,959
richard hoyer's psychology of

83
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,879
intelligence analysis

84
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,159
where he gives this printout and

85
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,120
uh you look at it and for me you know

86
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,000
even as an

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,080
analyst i was like oh like there's

88
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,680
nothing wrong with that

89
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,920
i just looked at it with my own

90
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,239
assumptions my own perception

91
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,040
and my own experience like paris in the

92
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,080
springtime

93
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,480
i read it as paris in the springtime and

94
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,000
i completely

95
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,200
just delete the second the um

96
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,840
so i have to actually like physically

97
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,560
like

98
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,040
look at it and follow it to be able to

99
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,439
get rid of my previous experience with

100
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,120
that particular phrase

101
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,720
especially since i love paris and uh

102
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,799
so i just get excited and i see

103
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,320
essentially

104
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,560
my experience and what i perceive it to

105
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,440
be

106
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,560
so if i have these issues and i'm an

107
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,960
intelligence analyst with

108
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,040
a lot of experience in different areas

109
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,080
that help

110
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,600
uh being a cti analyst uh

111
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,720
like it made me wonder uh what what

112
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,639
uh what other blue teamers are

113
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,880
experiencing and if they have the same

114
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,919
preconceived notions with the with the

115
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,600
information that they engage whether

116
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,560
it's alerts or

117
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,919
whatever it is that they're doing um

118
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,720
people don't really see uh stuff based

119
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,800
on their previous experience

120
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,840
another problem is short-term memory so

121
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,880
our working memory you can hold seven

122
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,400
plus or minus two items depending upon

123
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,199
your brain

124
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,320
and uh whatever is going on with this

125
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,360
and so um there's got to be a way

126
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,039
to work with the issues related to

127
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,960
your short-term memory in order to

128
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,280
become better analysts

129
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,520
and the other thing is long-term memory

130
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,600
so long-term memory

131
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,800
basically happens through association

132
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,320
some mental models analogies and

133
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,440
uh it takes a little bit of time maybe

134
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,560
some repetition

135
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,240
for some people like myself so how do

136
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,000
you work with the way that the mind

137
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,880
works

138
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,880
and this is something that i'll explore

139
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,800
further uh the other thing is

140
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,360
experienced analysts have baggage and

141
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,199
what i mean by that

142
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,919
is that they have previous experience

143
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,600
previous beliefs

144
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,080
previous ways of performing analysis

145
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,680
especially if they've been to

146
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,720
multiple companies or had multiple

147
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,440
reorgs and different people telling them

148
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,039
how they want things to be done

149
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,400
right previous uh preconceived notions

150
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,479
so there's a lot that experienced

151
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,319
analysts have to work with

152
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,840
as far as unlearning behaviors on

153
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,039
learning perceptions

154
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,000
and learning biases that they might have

155
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,560
which

156
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,080
is important but also sometimes can

157
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,199
hinder

158
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,759
analysis as well but i have some good

159
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,560
news

160
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,840
there is no substitution for experience

161
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,280
i love you experienced people so thank

162
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,000
you for

163
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,520
staying with us and helping newcomers

164
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,080
and juniors and and mid-level people

165
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,800
such as myself

166
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,120
so what kind of analyst do you want to

167
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,319
be i

168
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,120
personally would love to be like madonna

169
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,160
in this picture here

170
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,400
because i love madonna too she's

171
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,840
freaking amazing

172
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,919
um and so thinking about that i'm like

173
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,400
okay

174
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,560
so like i can just be the regular

175
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,479
analyst like looking through the logs

176
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,560
and trying to pivot through dns stuff

177
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,680
and all of that ips right or i can take

178
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,400
it a step

179
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,680
further and think about how

180
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,840
it is that i'm parsing through the data

181
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,280
in my mind

182
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,919
so you know i have some assumptions for

183
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:20,880
instance

184
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,000
if you're looking over uh you know uh

185
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,199
some sort of uh

186
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,080
c2 for malware you know there's a lot of

187
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,240
assumptions that go with that

188
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,319
when you're analyzing data and trying to

189
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,680
look at stuff which could

190
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,680
mean that you might miss something so um

191
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,919
thinking about how you're thinking can

192
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,720
be helpful and there are some benefits

193
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,440
so i'll talk briefly about some logical

194
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,639
fallacies there

195
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,080
are a ton like if you google logical

196
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,960
fallacies

197
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,919
i mean you could spend a while like a

198
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:54,960
while

199
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,280
so here are some of the ones that i

200
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,160
picked out

201
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,800
that that i've at least caught myself on

202
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,520
so

203
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,879
i'm i'm telling all myself i'm sorry

204
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,199
so this one cause and effect right uh

205
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,039
physical properties versus everything

206
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,639
else so

207
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,720
what does that mean what does that mean

208
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,759
to blue teamers and cti analysts so

209
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,039
basically if you think about an animal

210
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,960
in the woods and they're walking and it

211
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,440
just rained and they leave prince right

212
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,560
that's a cause

213
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,879
effect that's like a physical thing

214
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,080
that's going on

215
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,199
um another thing is

216
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,200
i mean i'm sorry i'm gonna use this

217
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,519
example but the apple from the tree

218
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,479
uh if if an apple falls from a tree

219
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,679
right you can

220
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,640
assume that gravity is somehow involved

221
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,120
uh

222
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,800
the cause and effect of physical

223
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,399
properties but

224
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,040
when you try to extrapolate that and

225
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,160
apply that

226
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,279
to apt behaviors or

227
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,200
i don't know let's say the economy and

228
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,600
say that you know because of x

229
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,080
now the economy is going up or down like

230
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,040
that seems

231
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,560
um like not not the not the best

232
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,839
thing to do so this is kind of what that

233
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,880
fallacy is

234
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,920
another one is analogy so um

235
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,920
a great example that i found for this is

236
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,560
just because the sock training worked

237
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:18,959
for

238
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,920
these analysts it might not work for

239
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,480
these

240
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,839
other analysts if that makes sense so

241
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,240
um being open to suggestions

242
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,560
and not necessarily assuming that

243
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,480
everyone fits in the box right

244
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,200
this is what diana initiative is about

245
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,399
at least i believe

246
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,800
so you know no one no one fits in a nice

247
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
square box and stay in your

248
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,040
stay in your hole like different people

249
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,279
learn differently different people

250
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,440
consume information differently

251
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,040
different people understand things

252
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,320
differently so

253
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,440
if you take this particular um

254
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,320
logical fallacy and see how you're

255
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,600
thinking well

256
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,839
well this works this way so of course it

257
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,040
would work that way with these people um

258
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,519
like just take a step back and be like

259
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,640
hmm

260
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,880
is this one of those fallacies that

261
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,240
cheerio talked about

262
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,839
let me see so hopefully that helps

263
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,279
the other thing is probability so um

264
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,519
for instance in the sock right let's say

265
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,839
you get a ton of false positives i'm

266
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:24,160
just

267
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,800
throwing out an example and you're like

268
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,760
oh well we

269
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,880
always get false positives so you know

270
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,279
like

271
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,959
auto close everything and so what i'm

272
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,160
saying is like

273
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,720
just because there's a probability that

274
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,640
there could be a false positive

275
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,720
doesn't necessarily mean that the alert

276
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,000
that you're working

277
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,800
is a false positive so doing group

278
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,600
closes

279
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,480
or permanently closing something or

280
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,200
however it

281
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,399
works within your organization um

282
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,480
like i would i would take a step back

283
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,600
and be like huh

284
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,800
am i is this a logical fallacy involved

285
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,480
with just assuming that it's a false

286
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,320
positive without actually looking into

287
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,040
it

288
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,399
so that's another way anecdotal so this

289
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,839
is this is pretty good with pretty much

290
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,880
anyone for instance my previous

291
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,680
experience as a small business owner

292
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,200
sometimes i try i tend to get stuck in

293
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,519
a lot of my business experience and

294
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,360
infosec is a different industry

295
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,399
granted a lot of the business stuff

296
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,000
is very similar um you know on and on

297
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,200
but um you know stepping back and being

298
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,079
like okay

299
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,320
like you know in my previous experience

300
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,880
with this i thought it was

301
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,040
um you know i would just write it off as

302
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,959
fishing or something like that but then

303
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,959
looking into it it's like oh

304
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,079
um no it wasn't fishing and

305
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,959
it was you know a compromised vendor or

306
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,399
or something like that right

307
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,240
like not relying and uh making my own

308
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,320
experience with stuff the most important

309
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:00,639
thing

310
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,200
like being able to take additional

311
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,200
information in and be like hey wait

312
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,279
this isn't fishing this is business

313
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,800
email compromise

314
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,399
you know and being able to discern that

315
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,000
so cognitive biases really quick so

316
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,040
anchoring this is where you know you get

317
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,680
an alert

318
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,440
and you have the initial information and

319
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,959
someone's like oh

320
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,480
um you know it's just it's just uh you

321
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,160
know them sending something to their

322
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,240
personal email blah blah blah whatever

323
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,240
right and so you get that initial

324
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,000
information and you stay

325
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,040
anchored on that information even though

326
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,760
uh you might be provided additional

327
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,880
information

328
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,760
that might uh combat that so you you

329
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,120
perform your analysis

330
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,079
all based on that initial like hint or

331
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:48,560
hunch

332
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,519
or intuition and sometimes that's not

333
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,880
necessarily

334
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,120
uh the best way to do things and that's

335
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,240
a bias as far as your analysis

336
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,720
so a lot of the stuff i read um they

337
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,680
said

338
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,720
they said awareness of that

339
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,720
of being aware of how you're handling

340
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,920
the initial

341
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,560
uh content that's coming in is not

342
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,839
necessarily helpful

343
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,399
so what they suggested if at all

344
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,120
possible

345
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,160
is to approach the information kind of

346
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,480
like

347
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,160
empty mind where um you try to set your

348
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,440
biases

349
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,240
your assumptions your perceptions kind

350
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,440
of aside and

351
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,120
pretend you're looking at it with fresh

352
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,639
eyes and

353
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,680
um the other thing is to slow

354
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,360
down when making decisions like a lot of

355
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,079
times

356
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,279
in corporate america uh you need to make

357
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,880
really fast decisions

358
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,320
and that's not necessarily helpful for

359
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,360
analysis so if you can at all just 10

360
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,120
seconds just count 10

361
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,600
9 8 7 just do a really brief countdown

362
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,279
um and that will help you with your

363
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,120
decision making process

364
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,720
when performing analysis another one is

365
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,320
confirmation bias so um

366
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,880
this one also is kind of similar to the

367
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,760
other one

368
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,880
except uh you go on pre-existing beliefs

369
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,160
and hypotheses

370
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,920
and you only you only search for stuff

371
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,480
that supports what it is that you

372
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,600
believe it to be

373
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,600
if that makes sense so um a good way

374
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,800
around this that cti analysts use

375
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,000
is analytical thinking model uh thinking

376
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,920
uh like structured analytic techniques

377
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,079
which i'll talk about in a little bit

378
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,000
and then also mental models like

379
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,279
different frameworks and stuff

380
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,320
so thinking about thinking is

381
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,639
for blue and richards hoyer says

382
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,519
analysts should be self-conscious about

383
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,639
their reasoning

384
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,440
process and i definitely am i'm like oh

385
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,120
gee

386
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,240
i uh did i insert too much bias into

387
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,800
this

388
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,000
uh so i tend to look over it and ask

389
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,560
myself a lot of internal questions

390
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,560
kind of like um if you're really good at

391
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,760
introspection

392
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,160
you will be a fabulous at uh this

393
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,120
so how can you be more conscious when

394
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,560
you're working with the data

395
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,760
because the problem is you don't know

396
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,240
how serious the alert or situation is

397
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,320
until you do

398
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,040
and time is limited so the executives

399
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,160
manager director

400
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,399
whomever they want the information

401
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,440
yesterday

402
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,000
but yet wanting the information

403
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,880
yesterday

404
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,759
and it not necessarily working with how

405
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,440
decision making and analysis

406
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,720
works like how do you compromise and so

407
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,480
i'm suggesting doing using the cti

408
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,759
mindset

409
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,279
as a technique so generally in cti

410
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,399
circles

411
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,920
us mindsets are kind of

412
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,120
not necessarily the best um basically

413
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,720
they're quick to form

414
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,079
but resistant to change so instead of

415
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:06,560
saying

416
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,279
you must have this mindset it's more

417
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,320
like a hat

418
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,079
that you put on and you're like oh you

419
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,480
know i'm gonna put on my cti hat

420
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,040
for a second and just sit back and kind

421
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,160
of observe

422
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,360
what my what my assumptions are and what

423
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,519
my biases might be

424
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,800
and um you know try to slow down with my

425
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,440
thinking

426
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,480
and stuff like that

427
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,839
and the thing is with being an analyst

428
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,519
you need to kind of work out your

429
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,199
analysis muscles

430
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,199
like it's not something that just

431
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,120
happens overnight

432
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,839
and breaking down the problems into

433
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,320
easily digestible parts

434
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,839
um you know you're dealing with this

435
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,839
alert and these logs this log and that

436
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:50,560
log and

437
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,920
you know ah so um

438
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,800
kind of breaking like like it says like

439
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,680
break it down

440
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,279
make it into easily uh

441
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,839
uh portioned things that you can

442
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,119
actually tackle so it's

443
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,400
not overwhelming the other

444
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,679
great suggestion is to get out of your

445
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,679
head so um

446
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,839
decision trees and this comes directly

447
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,319
from these structured analytic

448
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,720
techniques books so if you want detailed

449
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,919
information

450
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,919
on how to do some of this stuff i mean

451
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,439
there's like a whole

452
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,840
it's big book and they talk about

453
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,960
decision trees

454
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,320
diagrams models mind maps lists like

455
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,440
um i know it sounds simple but honestly

456
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,400
sometimes it's the simple solutions that

457
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,120
help

458
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,120
and make a huge difference

459
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,760
and also it helps you have conversations

460
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,240
with

461
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,400
other people and that's definitely

462
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,760
important

463
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,200
and so as ariana grande says break up

464
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,240
with your

465
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,600
habits so if i look at a threat intel

466
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,400
report

467
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,200
and i view it the same way that that

468
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,039
doesn't necessarily help because i could

469
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:05,440
miss

470
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,480
things if you know what i mean so i

471
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,960
sometimes consult with co-workers

472
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,360
i consult with peers in the industry

473
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,919
about questions that i have about things

474
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,200
that i'm seeing or not seeing um so

475
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,240
i definitely um rely on other people to

476
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,200
help with the

477
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,760
with whatever is going on in in my head

478
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,039
right

479
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,720
the other thing is observing your

480
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,200
thoughts so the easiest way i do this

481
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,679
is to just pretend that i'm in a movie

482
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:34,640
theater

483
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,080
and i watch my thoughts coming up

484
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,600
and i try not to attach any emotion or

485
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,520
value to any of those thoughts and i

486
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,960
just let them come up

487
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,880
and i'm just aware of what it is that

488
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,080
i'm thinking as i'm doing the analysis

489
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,760
so i purposefully wrote all of this

490
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,520
stuff down because i feel this is an

491
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,000
important

492
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,880
slide and these are some questions that

493
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,559
you can ask yourself

494
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,360
while performing analysis to up your

495
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,960
analysis game

496
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,919
so really quick um it's it asks you know

497
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,080
have i been looking for data to

498
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,280
disprove the hypothesis what assumptions

499
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,520
am i making what information am i

500
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,799
ignoring

501
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,440
and um the one that catches me up

502
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,400
sometimes

503
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
am i juggling more than seven plus or

504
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,720
minus two items if so

505
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,720
i need to get this out of my head and

506
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,880
onto paper or something so i usually

507
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,280
have

508
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,000
like my little like notepad up even when

509
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,720
i'm doing

510
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,960
my doctoral homework right or any of

511
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,840
that stuff

512
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,320
i have it up and i just really quick

513
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,679
notes put it down

514
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:45,200
and uh like a huge relief huge relief

515
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,120
the other thing is make a paper

516
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,799
checklist so

517
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,360
everything i read in structured analytic

518
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,080
techniques

519
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,799
and analysis of competing hypotheses

520
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,360
suggests to put something on paper

521
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,919
um there were doctors at this hospital

522
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:00,480
and

523
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,400
uh they were suggested to use a

524
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,000
checklist and they're like nah

525
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
i'm good i'm a doctor i know what i'm

526
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,200
doing and

527
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,760
the nurses were like oh uh-huh like

528
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,600
we're gonna use a checklist and for

529
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,039
every patient

530
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,480
we are going to use this checklist so

531
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,360
by using that checklist it turned out

532
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,320
that it actually

533
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,640
saved lives that probably wouldn't have

534
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,840
been saved because they would have

535
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,720
missed

536
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,240
essential steps so i'm suggesting

537
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,440
that if it's good for health care

538
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,960
and saving lives writing stuff down

539
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,320
in a checklist might actually be helpful

540
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,559
for infosec too so brainstorming

541
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,320
uh you know what that is starburst is

542
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,640
more like coming up with a gazillion

543
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,159
questions for a particular

544
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,200
situation i'm really good at that um

545
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,320
and you can do that solo and in a group

546
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,480
another thing that i added was gestalt

547
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,440
therapy so

548
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,240
basically with that you do role playing

549
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:00,640
so

550
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,799
for instance um like if i'm having a

551
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,720
hard time i'll be like

552
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,039
you know i'll pretend i'm like either my

553
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,120
co-worker or katie nichols or

554
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,799
robert emily or one of those really

555
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,159
awesome people

556
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,880
and like hmm what would they tell me you

557
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,080
know and of course

558
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,640
of course it's total role playing and

559
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,840
i'm not you know

560
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,679
speaking on behalf of them all of that

561
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,320
right but sometimes it helps like

562
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,039
uh to leverage that or uh when

563
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,960
developers say they're rubber ducky

564
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,600
technique

565
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,720
so sometimes just talking out loud to

566
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,440
my cat not really i better not admit

567
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,600
that on a recorded video

568
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,720
but having conversations with people and

569
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,960
kind of going over the thought process

570
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,840
is just immensely helpful for me

571
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,919
um so the other thing is cultures

572
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,960
and nation states like i try not to uh

573
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,799
dabble in that just because my family's

574
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,400
from mexico city

575
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,320
and um i understand that cultural stuff

576
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,320
based upon my background

577
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,080
but for instance if i'm trying to guess

578
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,000
what china or russia or some of those

579
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,320
other places that are a little different

580
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,559
um from how i grew up in my

581
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,480
understanding of cultural stuff like i'm

582
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,320
not going to try to

583
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,720
uh put myself in in their shoes like

584
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,320
there's putting yourself in their shoes

585
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,120
and then there's

586
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,760
putting yourself in their shoes and i

587
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,440
don't understand some of the nuances

588
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,000
because i don't specialize in that

589
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,919
the other suggestion is thinking in

590
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,480
graphs and not lists

591
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,880
and uh microsoft wrote a great blog on

592
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,960
this and i can share that out

593
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:41,600
actually i'll do that right now

594
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,720
in the chat and then uh don't flip

595
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,960
or fence yourself in pick multiple

596
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,799
hypotheses

597
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,039
build evidence for and against your

598
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,480
hypotheses

599
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,480
here's a matrix that you can use

600
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,360
evidence and then the hypotheses across

601
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,320
the top and basically what you want to

602
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:00,960
do is

603
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,240
attempt to disprove your hypothesis

604
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,679
and how dependent is your conclusion to

605
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,400
critical items

606
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,720
uh you want to discuss the likelihood of

607
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,799
all hypotheses

608
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,880
and you want to identify clues for

609
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,240
events taking

610
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,880
a different course than expected and you

611
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,039
know who does a really great job at this

612
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:23,760
uh

613
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,600
digital shadows did and um i'm gonna

614
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,640
post this in the chat as well and

615
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,760
um they have an example of ach that

616
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,200
honestly i still look at

617
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,480
it's my inspiracion so they're really

618
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,200
helpful

619
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,039
and i look at that when i want to do ach

620
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,760
it requires practice i suggest scenario

621
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,240
based

622
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,279
exercises and uh that's a really great

623
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,320
way to practice

624
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,799
and kind of learn how to integrate that

625
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,360
into your everyday analysis

626
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,559
i suggest to get a ref for tabletops and

627
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,440
to suspend

628
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,640
office politics during exercises and

629
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,960
here's beyonce um sometimes i just

630
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,640
imagine what beyonce would say to my

631
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,520
haters

632
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,720
and then everything is perfect again so

633
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,159
uh yeah i warned you i love beyonce um

634
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,320
and then teamwork so if you work in a

635
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,360
toxic place

636
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,360
and people aren't willing to work on

637
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,120
analysis skills

638
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,520
um reach out to other blue teamers and

639
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,559
other orgs

640
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,120
and build that skill set so that you can

641
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,840
provide more

642
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,679
value to the organization you work for

643
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,720
so to sum up think about thinking to

644
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,640
up your analysis game use a cti mindset

645
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,159
as a technique

646
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,320
uh ask yourself questions when

647
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,240
performing analysis

648
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,120
and attempt to disprove your hypothesis

649
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,720
instead of trying to prove it

650
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,799
and finally practice practice practice

651
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,760
so here's the main takeaways uh from

652
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,440
this presentation

653
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,880
thank you so much for attending my talk

654
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,720
and you can dm me and i will be happy to

655
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,200
answer

656
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:11,760
questions thank you very much
