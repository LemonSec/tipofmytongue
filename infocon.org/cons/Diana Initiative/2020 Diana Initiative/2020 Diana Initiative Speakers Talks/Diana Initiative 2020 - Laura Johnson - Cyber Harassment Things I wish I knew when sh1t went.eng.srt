over to you laura thank you

40
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,000
thank you so much so

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,280
i have one of the normal stories of how

42
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,119
you come about a talk is sitting outside

43
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,399
another conference

44
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,000
with a few people saying i wonder if

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,840
this would be a good idea and then

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,920
having the support luckily of many

47
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,880
friends

48
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,040
to get me to the point where i could put

49
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,880
this together and i could

50
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,079
start to really speak about it

51
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,200
so with that i am honestly

52
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,360
just a regular old human being who has

53
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,040
way too many animals in the house

54
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,360
and hopefully all of them stay quiet or

55
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,840
don't walk across the keyboard during

56
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,878
this um

57
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,120
one of the oddball things that happened

58
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,080
to me

59
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,480
was receiving i mean five six pager

60
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,080
manifesto style

61
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,319
emails as well as texts and things and

62
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,440
that led me to

63
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,720
quite the situation of where i kind of

64
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,280
looped into the trolley moment um for

65
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,400
those of you who don't know that

66
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,280
scenario

67
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,080
um it's where you're you know in charge

68
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,360
of this trolley it's coming down the

69
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,239
tracks

70
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,400
and you have to make an option between

71
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,720
somebody that you know and strangers

72
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,360
that you don't

73
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,920
that's one of those scenarios for it and

74
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,879
they always ask

75
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,319
you know from an ethics side what you

76
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,640
would choose well this was a very

77
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,920
interesting situation for me because by

78
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,200
speaking out about this

79
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,879
i you know have to run the risk that

80
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,879
um people will know who i'm talking

81
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,160
about and maybe

82
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,360
that person will get more angry at me or

83
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,800
um one of the biggest anxieties so that

84
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,319
is what if you know

85
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,920
people think i'm lying or nobody

86
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,480
believes me um so in reality i'm

87
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,560
not in control of the trolley at all i'm

88
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,080
kind of laying next to the person who

89
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,840
sent me those manifesto emails to be

90
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,599
honest with you because

91
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,360
um at least that's how i feel that

92
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,280
there's a chance that

93
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,920
by speaking out that you know i would

94
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,400
get this

95
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,480
backlash but the more that i thought

96
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,120
about this the more i realized that

97
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,040
who i am is that person who has the

98
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,560
opportunity to speak out about it who

99
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,400
has the opportunity to be

100
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,000
an ear for somebody else that's going

101
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,920
through this and

102
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,159
i would rather be in that position than

103
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,280
be too scared

104
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,360
um to speak out but i completely

105
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,959
understand people who are

106
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,080
because i was right there

107
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,360
one of the biggest things i want to

108
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,120
point out before i get started is

109
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,400
i am absolutely not a lawyer i

110
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,200
hired a very good one um to handle this

111
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,920
case

112
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,760
um throughout the process and i am

113
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,360
definitely not a therapist

114
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,439
i am an ear for anybody who needs to

115
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,879
talk um

116
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,280
but i also had to hire a stellar one as

117
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,159
well

118
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,360
to get through the trauma and mental

119
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,840
anguish that went with this

120
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,640
so please if you ever need somebody to

121
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,478
speak to you i'm absolutely here for you

122
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,560
um but i am neither one of those things

123
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,479
so for harassment in general i wanted to

124
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,360
start out here

125
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,160
because deriding her defining harassment

126
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,080
has been a very difficult process

127
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,280
not only for myself but for

128
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,400
my lawyer and my lawyer is the one

129
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,960
who used the term that a judge is just a

130
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,280
stranger in a rogue

131
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,639
or you have a jury that is just

132
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,639
strangers to you so unfortunately

133
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,840
there's

134
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,919
some sort of factors that line up where

135
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,759
you are worried about

136
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,040
and your lawyer sometimes tells you to

137
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,360
be worried about you know how you appear

138
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,960
in court how you speak in court

139
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,400
if you know you're scared could that

140
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,639
change things uh it's very unfortunate

141
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,320
with the way that that works but one of

142
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,840
the biggest tips that i got

143
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,479
in that scenario is to always be factual

144
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:04,880
and not

145
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,120
emotional if you can be which is

146
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,000
definitely not

147
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,120
easy by any means and

148
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,199
the harassment laws absolutely have not

149
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,479
caught up with

150
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,039
online lifestyles however there are a

151
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,160
few interesting

152
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,639
ones that as i was going down the line

153
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,479
that i was very surprised about

154
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,680
um finding out for instance when

155
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,680
i looked into different states

156
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,600
colorado puts in that the school

157
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,440
districts are subject to all federal

158
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,280
laws and states

159
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,919
prohibiting discrimination and they go

160
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,400
into

161
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,360
when you're prohibiting that

162
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,759
discrimination that also falls into

163
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,039
an electronic act or gesture or pattern

164
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,360
or bullying to coerce or intimidate

165
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,440
and to cause physical or emotional harm

166
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,440
so they do loop those in

167
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,840
to that factor but unfortunately when i

168
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,600
was going through this process

169
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,400
my lawyer was not truly aware of that

170
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,639
however they were a fantastic lawyer and

171
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,160
really helped out during this

172
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,800
he also um i looked into arkansas which

173
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,360
was

174
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,120
a person who commits the offense of

175
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,800
cyber bullying

176
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,960
and this can be he or she transmits

177
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,560
sends or posts a communication by

178
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,400
electronic means with the purpose to

179
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,360
frighten

180
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,080
cohorts or intimidate or threaten abuse

181
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,800
or harass

182
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,600
or alarm another person so these laws

183
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:23,919
are

184
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,880
here to protect you just individuals

185
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,319
haven't caught up with the knowledge

186
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,400
base of it and that includes

187
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,520
the lawyers and the judges as well so

188
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,080
that it loops into the next thing i

189
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,840
constantly heard was

190
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,919
well what about my freedom of speech i

191
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,360
should be able to say

192
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,880
whatever i want to say that's my right

193
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,639
to do so

194
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,120
and the more i dug into that that is

195
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,960
absolutely not true you do not have the

196
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,639
right to hurt somebody you don't have

197
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,720
the right to threaten somebody

198
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,919
and those tend to get a little bit of a

199
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,840
gray area

200
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,240
and if you look it up in the dictionary

201
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,759
i have

202
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,680
highly suggested for a slight laugh for

203
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,880
a minute

204
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,880
because really your legal right to

205
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,639
express an opinion

206
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,240
it you would think that that could fall

207
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,400
into

208
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,240
saying something to an individual that

209
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,440
could potentially hurt them

210
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,280
so what is not protected is that harming

211
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,599
other scenario

212
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,080
if the words that are coming out of

213
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,039
somebody's mouth

214
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,160
onto somebody's paper online has an

215
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,880
intent

216
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,599
to harm you in any way shape or form you

217
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,919
do have a right to stand up for yourself

218
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,880
you have a right at any point in time

219
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,639
during that if you feel threatened

220
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,759
to report that and

221
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,120
look into what you could do to get

222
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,560
yourself protected so you don't have to

223
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,840
keep enduring it over and over and over

224
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,560
so the emails and texts and direct

225
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,919
messages all of the above

226
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,680
loop into that cyber changing the

227
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,879
definition of what is harassment

228
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,160
since you know

229
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,120
aol chatrooms and before i'm dating

230
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,680
myself there

231
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,840
everybody looked at stalking and

232
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,800
harassing

233
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,360
as somebody in your bush somebody who's

234
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,879
knocking on your door

235
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,880
following you to work that's no longer

236
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,000
the case anymore

237
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,159
so cyber has really changed what it

238
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,000
really means to stalk and harass

239
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,880
somebody

240
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,919
but somebody no longer has to

241
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,480
really find out where you live and find

242
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,760
out how to get to you

243
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,680
from a physical level now they just can

244
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,600
sit at their desk crack a laptop

245
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,640
and you know pay 5.99 and find out

246
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,160
every one of your addresses what car you

247
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,320
drive phone numbers etc

248
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,000
uh it's absolutely terrifying what you

249
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,680
can get online

250
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,180
and even if you don't have much of a

251
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,360
[Music]

252
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,399
base of you know like my current job to

253
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,680
find out information

254
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,839
my 12 year old figured out how to get to

255
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,279
the sites to pay money

256
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,480
to find some of his friends

257
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,560
the biggest advice that i could give

258
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,240
though on this is do not become your

259
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,839
attacker

260
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,959
look at getting your legal counsel

261
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,920
involved for a protection order a

262
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,200
restraining order

263
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,519
before you block anybody before you know

264
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,600
if you block you're going to lose

265
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,959
your evidence and you don't want to do

266
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,320
that remember that your

267
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,560
any reply that you put down is going to

268
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,560
also be recorded as that evidence

269
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,120
so that's where it's kind of that old

270
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,560
saying of treat others how you want to

271
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,680
be treated

272
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,680
don't fall into treating someone how

273
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,519
they are treating you

274
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,080
if you fall into that you will end up in

275
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,120
court with a judge

276
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,519
or possibly a jury looking at you in a

277
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,519
way that you didn't intend to happen

278
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,959
and it was because you were thinking you

279
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,399
were doing the right thing by sticking

280
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,839
up for yourself

281
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,880
so there's many many ways that being

282
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,320
online

283
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,480
enables your harasser i don't want to go

284
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,920
into too many of them saying that i

285
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,839
don't want to give

286
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,519
somebody who may be trying to stalk

287
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,360
somebody more tips to the trade to hide

288
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,920
i will say as an amusing note with the

289
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,079
sometimes word hurt more if i had a time

290
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,279
machine

291
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,959
after what i have been through the first

292
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,320
thing i might do

293
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,240
is go back in time and kick the person

294
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,680
in the shins who said

295
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,279
the whole sticks and stones you know may

296
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,560
make bare bones but words will never

297
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,240
hurt me

298
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,440
i need a time machine for that

299
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,200
individual

300
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,800
during my process

301
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,440
i genuinely thought that my feelings

302
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,480
weren't valid

303
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,519
i genuinely thought that i was wrong

304
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,040
and i was being too sensitive i spent

305
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,880
many nights trying to figure out what

306
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,320
was wrong with me

307
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,360
why words on an email or a screen or a

308
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,959
piece of paper were bothering me

309
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,079
so so much and it wasn't until i was

310
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,200
sitting in a courtroom

311
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,079
with a stack full of emails watching a

312
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,640
judge read them over

313
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,480
and then hearing my final judgment come

314
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,240
across

315
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,880
that i finally honest to goodness broke

316
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,360
down

317
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,640
in every way shape or form and just

318
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,519
cried and i was trying to stay so so

319
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,120
strong through this whole process and

320
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,040
try to keep telling myself that

321
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,360
what i was reading wasn't true um that i

322
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,040
was being irrational

323
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,160
and to have a judge

324
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,279
read my final judgment

325
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,800
really said to me that this this is

326
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,000
wrong what people are doing right now is

327
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,600
wrong

328
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,200
and that's where i really started doing

329
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,839
some research

330
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,120
what worked for me though when i felt

331
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,120
helpless

332
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,240
was doing that research and finding that

333
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,519
i wasn't alone

334
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,120
that there were individuals that could

335
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,200
help me that there were therapists that

336
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,839
could help me

337
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,200
that there were therapists that deal

338
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,040
with the mental abuse that happens

339
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,439
online

340
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,839
that is where i learned to take my

341
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,519
evidence and put it into a place where i

342
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,560
would not

343
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,279
continue reading it over and over and

344
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,000
over again

345
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,120
creating forwarders so that

346
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,320
my lawyer would be getting the

347
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,639
information not me my lawyer would be

348
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,600
the one who would

349
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,040
call me or let me know that i needed to

350
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,120
you know be more cautious if i was

351
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,800
traveling to a certain location

352
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,560
be more cautious if i'm going into my

353
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,639
office if there were things that i

354
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,480
absolutely needed to know they would

355
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,560
inform me

356
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,440
i was very fortunate to get that advice

357
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,880
and take that advice

358
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,720
because before the advice came i was

359
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,160
rereading things i

360
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,120
i was pouring over them and crying and

361
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,800
questioning myself left and right

362
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,800
one of the things i never expected was i

363
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,200
applied for fmla for work because i had

364
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,120
to take a significant amount of time off

365
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,639
court and therapy and i

366
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,880
really genuinely thought fmla was for

367
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,079
people who had babies

368
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,079
or a family style emergency i never

369
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,440
thought that it would be

370
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,760
for trauma counseling and it was i was

371
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,120
able to get approved

372
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,240
i was able to feel that i could heal

373
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,440
and work on myself and not

374
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,240
have to worry about them losing my job

375
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,360
on top of everything else

376
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,199
and turning and finding people who were

377
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,800
supportive was

378
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,399
one of the things that really helped me

379
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,240
get out of that helpless stage

380
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,680
really trusting somebody to let them

381
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,519
know what's going on with me how i was

382
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,480
feeling

383
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,880
and that they were there for me because

384
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,600
as i said before i really did feel

385
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,800
like i was just being too sensitive and

386
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,399
there were individuals that told me i

387
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,600
was being dramatic there were

388
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,440
individuals that told me

389
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,519
that you know this person is such a nice

390
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,120
person and there's no way that they

391
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,560
meant that and i must be taking it out

392
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,360
of context

393
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,720
and between the therapy

394
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,360
and the support of friends and you know

395
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,600
the judgment that finally came through

396
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,000
i was able to see that you know i was

397
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,079
valid and i had a right to feel that way

398
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,440
in this day and age too i hear a lot of

399
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,160
comments from my situation

400
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,720
that at least i wasn't physically harmed

401
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,199
and i really hope that throughout the

402
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,880
process people will start to realize

403
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,240
that both both

404
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,199
need to be recognized as a problem that

405
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,040
the mental trauma that people

406
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,160
endure on a day-to-day basis is just as

407
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,880
real

408
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,000
as getting punched in the face

409
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,320
these are some of the quotes from the

410
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,440
emails that i received

411
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,639
and when i received these

412
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,920
i truly just hit the bottom of feeling

413
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,800
helpless

414
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,639
i was scared to go into my office i was

415
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,160
scared to walk out my door

416
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,800
i was scared to log into my computer i

417
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,320
wasn't sure who i could talk to

418
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,399
who i could trust who i could tell about

419
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,279
this i was scared if i showed my job

420
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,240
that i you know may or may not be

421
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,560
ambushed at work

422
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,199
that they would choose to fire me

423
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,759
instead of keeping me on

424
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,079
when in reality my office was incredibly

425
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,440
supportive

426
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,279
they were very helpful in keeping you

427
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,079
know me feeling safe

428
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,000
but that initial reading of that i mean

429
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,360
just threw me

430
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,000
for the biggest loop because i really

431
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,120
started to question whether i should

432
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,720
just comply with this person whether i

433
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,759
should do

434
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,839
everything they were asking me to do

435
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:52,959
just to make this

436
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,199
stop but no matter how many times i

437
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,120
complied with anything

438
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,480
it just kept getting worse

439
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,240
and kind of the icing on the cake was

440
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,959
knowing what they did for a living

441
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,839
and they highlighted it here in the

442
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,160
email

443
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,480
and then i really truly felt helpless i

444
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,920
truly didn't know how to get out from

445
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,560
underneath this

446
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,279
so i was able to keep myself very safe

447
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,120
and very secure once i had the

448
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,560
information

449
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,360
of how to do so starting out this

450
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,560
process i

451
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,800
didn't know about the fmla i didn't know

452
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,399
that a lawyer could help get me a

453
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,680
protective order

454
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,839
i had no idea i truly thought that

455
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,680
if somebody's sending you emails or

456
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,279
chats you just block them

457
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,720
and you try to move on with your life no

458
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,399
matter how many screen names they start

459
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,079
no matter how many platforms they go

460
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,959
after you on

461
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,320
but it's just something you have to live

462
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,000
with and that's absolutely not true

463
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,440
it is not something that you have to

464
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,320
live with you can get protected

465
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,959
even if it's something as small as

466
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,399
having

467
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,839
just that 5-10 minutes to turn off your

468
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:02,639
laptop and

469
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,520
have somebody to talk to it's really not

470
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,240
small

471
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,400
it will help you get through what's

472
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,400
going on

473
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,919
then you'll be able to take those steps

474
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,000
forward of how can i get myself safe

475
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,319
what does it mean for me to feel safe

476
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,559
and for me that really meant having that

477
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,559
protective order to make sure myself

478
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,839
and my son stopped being contact

479
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,959
that the abuse stopped it really meant

480
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,360
me having to file for this fmla

481
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,080
and have that moment to breathe away

482
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,720
from work

483
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,160
and get the healing that i needed to get

484
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,919
one of the hardest things though about

485
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,520
keeping myself safe was

486
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,720
not just running blocks left and right

487
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,039
and being able to not see anything

488
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,440
because as the lawyer told me i cannot

489
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:47,760
miss

490
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,320
any of the evidence because everything

491
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,799
is needed

492
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,520
as i started doing the research into

493
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,360
you know who else is having these

494
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,720
problems

495
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,080
one of the biggest

496
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,000
moments of just sadness that swept

497
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,039
across me

498
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,280
but then strength that came from that

499
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,799
was reading the foundation that i have

500
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,880
highlighted below

501
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,840
and what they are doing for kids what is

502
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,679
going on with students

503
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,840
how students are feeling how children

504
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,880
are feeling

505
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,000
what the suicide rates are of kids it's

506
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,039
astronomical

507
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,240
since everybody's really chatting more

508
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,120
online now that

509
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,360
all of your lives are online it has

510
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,120
really changed

511
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,400
and the foundation was founded

512
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,880
in 2007 after the founder's daughter

513
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,240
took her life

514
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,640
and that was due to a complete hoax

515
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,039
by a neighbor who was posing as a boy on

516
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,080
myspace

517
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,480
who harassed her to the point where she

518
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,320
did not feel

519
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,640
that she wanted to live anymore and

520
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,400
after she lost her life the foundation

521
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,840
was founded to try to reach out to more

522
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,360
students to more children

523
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,559
to more young adults and to adults to

524
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,160
try to get the information out there to

525
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,880
try to get help

526
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,840
all of this information too is years

527
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,840
back and i wanted to use that

528
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,760
information because of the fact that

529
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,320
we are so much now further down on

530
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,280
having our lives online

531
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,679
if 34 of students are reporting cyber

532
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:34,640
bullying

533
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,080
in 2015

534
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,960
it's going to be very interesting to

535
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,679
look

536
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,919
and really dig into what 2020 2021

537
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,960
has to come for this

538
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,120
and that's only those that are reporting

539
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,559
it

540
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,240
i talked to my son i talked to his

541
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,559
friends i talked to

542
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,160
kids that come over to my house quite

543
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,600
often about this how they're feeling

544
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,160
about this

545
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,919
and they said well we're just we were

546
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,440
told not to be sensitive you can't be

547
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,480
sensitive

548
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,840
and so a lot of this isn't being

549
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,000
reported

550
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,679
one of the hardest statistics out of

551
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,120
that 34

552
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,400
is that 18 of that youth

553
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,360
has reported self-harming at least once

554
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,400
due to

555
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,400
what they are getting online

556
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,720
six percent of those students reported

557
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,919
that they are digitally harming

558
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,440
themselves on purpose because it's

559
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,679
already happening to them anyway

560
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,159
so they are just continuing the problem

561
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,120
and it has found

562
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,039
that anyone who has the cyber bullying

563
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:41,440
is at

564
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,760
much much much greater risk of that

565
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,039
self-harm and suicide

566
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,480
the cdc in 2017 also listed suicide as

567
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,000
the second leading cause of death for

568
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,400
those

569
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,440
10 to 34

570
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,360
and the attempts among adolescents and

571
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,880
teens had doubled since 2008.

572
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,760
these statistics show us that we need to

573
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,360
have a change we need to have a change

574
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,400
to how

575
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,520
online is handled how it's viewed

576
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,360
trying to get people to understand that

577
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,559
words do matter

578
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,120
words do hurt and mental abuse is very

579
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,760
very real

580
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,960
the problem with having individuals

581
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,799
behind a keyboard who may not always

582
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:25,600
feel comfortable

583
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,039
saying something mean to someone in

584
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,039
person all of a sudden feel like they

585
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,000
have this enormous

586
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,159
strength or they can say whatever they

587
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,520
want because they're hiding behind a

588
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,918
screen

589
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,159
and i personally haven't found a way

590
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,799
to even start to help these kids i have

591
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,159
been doing

592
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,919
massive amounts of research on this i

593
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,000
have been trying to find

594
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,320
ways to reach out to different

595
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,559
communities to find out what can we do

596
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,760
what can we do to help

597
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,799
lessen these statistics

598
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,400
or what can we do

599
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,360
to really get the individuals who are

600
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,360
bullying online

601
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,480
consequences for their actions a couple

602
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,039
of the parents that i spoke to

603
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,799
after finding out that i was doing you

604
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,400
know these talks after finding

605
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,080
these foundations that i was starting to

606
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,440
speak to

607
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,440
there was a couple parents of 10 year

608
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,720
olds

609
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,080
12 various ages that said they didn't

610
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,919
have the strength to speak out yet

611
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,559
they they just weren't at that point of

612
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,760
healing where they could really speak

613
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,320
out

614
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,320
but did let me know that the individuals

615
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,760
that were harassing their child there

616
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,400
was no consequences for their actions

617
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,919
even though they had proof even though

618
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,840
they had evidence

619
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,880
the laws just didn't line up in court

620
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,080
when it came down to having somebody

621
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,799
really take responsibility for what they

622
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:55,840
had done to another human being

623
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,000
importantly the things that i did wrong

624
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,039
i want to say i was not in any way shape

625
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,720
or form

626
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,640
not responsible for some of the things

627
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,640
that happened to me

628
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,000
it's one of the things i had to come to

629
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,240
terms with that the questions of why

630
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,039
didn't i

631
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,080
just leave why didn't i just block

632
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,440
everything and walk away

633
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,640
why did i let it go on for so long

634
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,039
and not do anything about it and that

635
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,400
was things i had to work

636
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,720
on with myself being able to get my

637
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,000
self-esteem to the point

638
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
where i could stand up and say this this

639
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,400
is not okay i deserve better

640
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,080
no human being deserves to be treated

641
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,919
this way enough is enough and i'm going

642
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,559
to walk away

643
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,960
the experience really has got me to

644
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,039
understand of how strong

645
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,080
one can really be when they need to be

646
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,960
but i will tell you that i fell into

647
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,000
every

648
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,520
single category here that is associated

649
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,360
with this

650
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,960
there is not a single thing

651
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,400
that i didn't go through that i didn't

652
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:08,960
go through

653
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,120
thinking everything in this email was

654
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,240
correct

655
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,919
what is the point of me even being here

656
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,520
i started questioning whether or not i

657
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,799
was a good parent getting out of bed was

658
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,720
difficult opening computer was difficult

659
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,440
what happens to your self-esteem when

660
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,640
you're reading over and over and over

661
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,320
again someone else's opinions of you

662
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,080
it reminds me of the saying of when

663
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,080
someone keeps telling you you did

664
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,360
something even though you didn't do it

665
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,799
you finally just end up doing it because

666
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,640
you got blamed for it

667
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,159
it kind of felt like that was scenario

668
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,919
i shut out everybody because i was so

669
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,440
afraid that i was wrong

670
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,440
and that my feelings weren't valid and i

671
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,200
just shut them out

672
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,039
i didn't want to have someone else

673
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,559
telling me bad things about myself

674
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,640
i was afraid that was going to happen i

675
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,760
was afraid

676
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,279
by somebody not believing me that i

677
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,440
would feel more alone and

678
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,960
more that i was being overdramatic

679
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,400
and then the biggest thing that it took

680
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,720
me a long time to finally stop

681
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,080
doing was that i kept continuously

682
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,919
apologizing to the person who was

683
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,640
harassing me and taking blame for things

684
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,039
and saying that what they were saying

685
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,159
was correct just so that it would stop

686
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,360
when in reality when you start

687
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,720
apologizing for things that you don't

688
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,240
really want to apologize for at least

689
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,600
for me

690
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,760
i started believing them and it just

691
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,200
made me go further and further down that

692
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,679
grab a hole

693
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,919
and one of the hardest things that i

694
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,679
noticed with

695
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,679
speaking to kids and the parents of

696
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,120
children who are having cyberbullying

697
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,360
problem

698
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,200
is that feeling that you're not even

699
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,880
safe in your own home because you can't

700
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,240
open your laptop

701
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,600
it's no longer that you go to school

702
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,120
and if someone picks on you at school

703
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,120
you come home and you feel safe in your

704
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,159
home

705
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,039
but now with jumping on the cell phone

706
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,360
jumping online to play a game

707
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,520
that constant anxiety of is that person

708
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,520
who's harassing me going to be there

709
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,158
you never get that sense of being home

710
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,480
but with that there were many things

711
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,320
that i did right after

712
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,400
a period of time of really getting

713
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,440
through it and

714
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,720
finding out all the knowledge that i

715
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,400
needed and finding out the laws that i

716
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,080
needed getting the right attorney

717
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,360
and pushing through it honestly the day

718
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,159
i got that

719
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,559
protection order in my hand was the

720
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,520
biggest

721
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,159
breath of fresh air i have ever taken

722
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,600
and from then on i just kind of kept

723
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,600
stepping forwards

724
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,440
going up that hill just making sure i

725
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,960
could get over it

726
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,320
because one of the things i get accused

727
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,320
of quite often is that i'm obnoxiously

728
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:48,720
happy

729
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,320
like to the point of annoying and

730
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,320
i don't ever want that to change if

731
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,840
somebody is annoyed with me because i'm

732
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,919
obnoxiously happy i will take it i am

733
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,480
good with that

734
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,279
and one of the things that was kind of

735
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,279
hard for me to do is not be able

736
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,559
to get emotional when i was telling what

737
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,400
was going on because people just

738
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,240
didn't hear me they automatically

739
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,919
started judging the emotions or getting

740
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,360
uncomfortable that i was crying or

741
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,919
getting uncomfortable that i was angry

742
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,360
and they didn't hear me for what was

743
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,279
really going on or if i needed

744
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,279
you know some help i really needed some

745
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,120
help and i i needed to

746
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,720
figure out a way to state facts

747
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,480
and not state emotions

748
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,039
i definitely do not apologize anymore

749
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,120
for things that i did not do

750
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,600
um it's someone else's dumpster fire i

751
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,200
think one of the biggest things that has

752
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,000
come out of this

753
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,880
is that's a you problem i'm happy to

754
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,279
help you with that it's not a me problem

755
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,919
um versus saying oh that is absolutely

756
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,520
my problem i apologize for it and i try

757
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,159
to fix it

758
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,840
um instead i'd rather be supportive to

759
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,279
somebody um

760
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,120
instead of apologizing for something

761
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,520
that is not mine to own because i really

762
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,039
can't fix it if it's not mine anyway

763
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,799
um taking ownership of my life was a

764
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,240
huge thing that i did right

765
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,600
you know get out of the had to get out

766
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,320
of that bed i had to um

767
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,520
stop crying in the closet and say to

768
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,399
myself okay what

769
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,799
what one thing am i going to do today to

770
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,240
get this better

771
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,840
and the biggest thing i actually say to

772
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,799
the kids now

773
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,679
that are here in my home is it's not one

774
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:32,960
day at a time it's not one minute at a

775
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,960
time it's one second at a time

776
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,240
one day is far too long there's many

777
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,520
things that can happen during the day

778
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,279
there's a million things that can happen

779
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,799
during an hour or a minute i'm just

780
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,480
gonna take things one second at a time

781
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,039
what can i do in this second to try and

782
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,919
take a step forward

783
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,559
and then i stopped replying to any

784
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,640
harassing message just none

785
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,399
just i started out with stop sending

786
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,840
these messages and then i just said you

787
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,039
know what

788
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,960
i have so much to do so much to do

789
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,320
that replying to these is not on my list

790
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:12,080
of to-do's

791
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,200
i still wish especially after all

792
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,440
of the research i've done with children

793
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,600
all of the children that i've spoken to

794
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,320
the students at colleges too i wish that

795
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,640
i had the information

796
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,399
to truly help them to truly say

797
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,600
here's how you're going to find your

798
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,120
harasser here's how you're going to get

799
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,799
your harasser charged

800
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,480
i know a few steps to kind of get

801
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,559
yourself forward because i do know

802
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,120
um at least the way i felt is like i was

803
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,080
biking up a hill

804
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,760
but the chain fell off a long time ago

805
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,960
and i kind of am just sitting there

806
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,799
trying to figure it out

807
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,640
so i kind of want to be able to give you

808
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,559
know people here's your bike chain and

809
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:49,760
you know what here's a motor for your

810
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,279
bike and let's get up there let's figure

811
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,559
out how to get up there

812
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,240
so i want to keep doing the research to

813
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,919
find out more ways

814
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,000
to really help somebody feel safe feel

815
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,919
safe in their home feel safe

816
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,360
opening their you know text messages

817
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,399
one of the things that i found out

818
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:10,240
to really keep an eye on is the signs

819
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,760
that somebody is being

820
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,480
cyber harassed i mean there you're

821
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,919
normals of your height and anxiety and

822
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,399
fear that i had

823
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,880
down to if somebody is suddenly not

824
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,000
wanting to play online games

825
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,840
anymore they don't even want to carry

826
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,760
their cell phone anymore

827
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,720
they take their laptop and just put it

828
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,919
in a drawer put it away they don't want

829
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,919
anything to do with it

830
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,440
those are things where i would now start

831
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,039
asking instead of

832
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,240
i would think you were just trying to

833
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,640
take a day off of

834
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,000
getting away from that keyboard asking

835
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,200
hey are you okay you know something

836
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,760
going on

837
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,360
you know you feel all right the nervous

838
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,880
and jumping when someone's text message

839
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,840
alert goes off

840
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:55,200
and then you stream sleeping i am a fan

841
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,240
of sleeping

842
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,440
but you know 20 24 hours i want to make

843
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,480
sure i ask my friends

844
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,039
are you okay you know even are you sick

845
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,880
are you not feeling well

846
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,320
just making sure that i notice those

847
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,240
things that i'm not so wrapped up in you

848
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,600
know what's going on in my life that i

849
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,440
forget to really look at

850
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,440
those little keys that friends of mine

851
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,480
or family or mine

852
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,840
are putting off and i'm not picking up

853
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,840
on

854
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,200
one of the biggest things is knowing

855
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,559
that it might be a long fight

856
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,399
but it's going to get better it is going

857
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:33,200
to get better

858
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,440
even if it's finding the right counselor

859
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,720
finding the right lawyer

860
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,440
finding the right person to talk to

861
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,799
finding the right art project

862
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,720
to do to just feel better for a minute

863
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,880
it's going to get better

864
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,760
please please please don't give up i

865
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,159

866

867
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,840
it's never ending that harassment will

868
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,440

891
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,360
um you talked about tools and i think

892
00:32:59,360 --> 00:32:59,919
that's

893
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,519
it's so helpful um so there's

894
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,799
there's fmla and um

895
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,840
this if depending on one's job situation

896
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,120
um folks may have access to

897
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,720
an employee help help line that are

898
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,480
uh generally generally anonymous

899
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,679
and depending if

900
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,880
if you have this available to you you go

901
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,440
to

902
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,320
to a third party who can make references

903
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:34,640
to

904
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,120
various various forms of assistance

905
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,240
um laura i didn't

906
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,240
i didn't know if you wanted to talk

907
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,679
about

908
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:50,000
um uh ptsd because as as you're talking

909
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,559
about

910
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,159
the harassment and and

911
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,200
you know it you can break a bone or you

912
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,320
know have a scar

913
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,320
or a physical injury but

914
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,399
the mental injuries um are very real

915
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,000
and so i didn't know if you wanted to

916
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,918
talk a little

917
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:12,079
a little bit more about that or some of

918
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,000
the some of the steps

919
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,040
that that you went through um as

920
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,199
you walk through that journey it's

921
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,800
because it's a journey it's not it's

922
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,280
there's no snap in fingers right

923
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,000
absolutely not

924
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,760
um one of the things that i will be

925
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,040
honest with that i got diagnosed with

926
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,719
was stockholm syndrome

927
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,480
which was one of the most shocking

928
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,320
things to hear from the counselor

929
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,918
because i never i thought that was you

930
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,159
know being kidnapped

931
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,839
i never thought that that was really

932
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,760
more along the lines of

933
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,040
having somebody convince you

934
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,079
that you were somebody else

935
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,480
and having to walk through the steps of

936
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,480
going through each process of saying to

937
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,320
a therapist of

938
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,800
maybe i am not a very good parent maybe

939
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,599
they're right

940
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,320
maybe i do this and the counselor would

941
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,320
have to come back to me saying why

942
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,680
why do you feel that way is that

943
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,280
something that you felt or is that

944
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,280
something that someone convinced you

945
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,320
that you felt and having to honestly

946
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,920
chip away at

947
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,440
the things that kind of buried my

948
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,359
self-esteem the things that made me feel

949
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:17,760
like

950
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,760
i shouldn't even be an engineer anymore

951
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,960
that i should go back to being a

952
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,200
waitress because

953
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,119
i'm not good at my job that was another

954
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,560
one i was convinced on so just

955
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,599
chipping away at those pieces that

956
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,640
i was convinced or wrong with me and

957
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,320
that's where i look at the one second at

958
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:34,960
a time

959
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,040
because if you take one piece at a time

960
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,880
and start

961
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,480
really going through that really finding

962
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,200
out why you feel that way and

963
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,880
boiling it down to is that something you

964
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,640
want to better within yourself

965
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,079
and maybe that's something that you

966
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,320
don't feel quite right about yourself

967
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,920
with but you want to move forward with

968
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,880
it that's one thing

969
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,079
that's one thing of saying hey i have um

970
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,599
some strength and some weaknesses and i

971
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:58,880
really want to work on these weaknesses

972
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,000
of mine

973
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,760
it's another thing when all of these

974
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,000
weaknesses that you're listing off

975
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,839
are in emails chats and texts from

976
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:07,200
somebody else

977
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,359
that you have now gotten convinced to

978
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,960
true

979
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,040
and having to dial those back and really

980
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,280
realize that those are not

981
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,720
who you are and the other side to that

982
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,800
that was really difficult for me

983
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,560
is i got mean i was mean like every time

984
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,920
somebody said something to me i didn't

985
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,720
like

986
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,920
i was firing things back that i was

987
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,560
shocked was coming out of my mouth

988
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,280
and it was because it was just pro it's

989
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,240
it's

990
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,839
almost the same as getting computer

991
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:39,760
programmed it's like i got recoded in my

992
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,000
head

993
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,280
of of who i was so it's really

994
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,480
taking each little piece of yourself and

995
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,760
and taking it back and not feeling like

996
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,040
somebody took it from you and you can't

997
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,640
get it back because it's yourself and

998
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,240
it's your strength and you know who you

999
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,640
are on the inside and who you want to be

1000
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,560
and that's who you need to push forward

1001
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,200
with in the therapy and that's

1002
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,800
where you need to find those supportive

1003
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,079
people to surround yourself with

1004
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,720
yeah um so a lot a number of comments

1005
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,480
were coming in during your presentation

1006
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:12,880

1008
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,960

00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,320
while people are thinking about

1016
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,079
questions oops

1017
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,200
um uh here's a note that

1018
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,640
um that was left in the chat and

1019
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,599
and interested in your thoughts laura

1020
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:50,000
the best

1021
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,160
reply is no reply and you know

1022
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,720
what makes sense to do when somebody

1023
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,520
says something that's really hurtful

1024
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,560
um what what are some of the you

1025
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,160
indicated that you know

1026
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,200
you you didn't reply what how did you

1027
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,119
get to that process how did you get to

1028
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,160
that place

1029
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,280
at that point i had a lawyer

1030
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,320
so once i had and i actually had the

1031
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,599
lawyer through the process i just had to

1032
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:18,000
be very

1033
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,839
careful how i worked some of that

1034
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,119
because of um

1035
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,240
not giving away who this in regards to

1036
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,119
um so i had a lawyer and what i did was

1037
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,320
i no longer replied

1038
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,520
i forwarded those all if my lawyer felt

1039
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,640
like they should apply

1040
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,160
or said reply then they would if

1041
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,200
it was just a five-page rant about

1042
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,880
how that individual felt i was as a

1043
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,880
human being

1044
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,520
then there was no reply needed and it

1045
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,880
was just evidence that kept getting

1046
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,599
catalogued

1047
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,760
and that all was taken into court and

1048
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,440
the fact that i didn't reply and that my

1049
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,280
lawyer didn't reply was also taken into

1050
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,560
court because if

1051
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,400
in my scenario when there was no reply

1052
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,920
and emails just keep coming in

1053
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,320
and coming in and coming in and coming

1054
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,119
in

1055
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,320
the judge is going to take a look at

1056
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,560
that and ask why why won't this

1057
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,560
individual stop

1058
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,880
because you're not feeding it you're not

1059
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,560
asking them to talk back to you you're

1060
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,400
not even giving them more information to

1061
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,440
write back to you

1062
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,960
there's absolutely no reason for this

1063
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,720
person to be reaching out to you don't

1064
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,040
give that person a reason to continue to

1065
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,200
reach out to you

1066
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,839
if you don't reply and they keep going

1067
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,280
that is the best evidence you're gonna

1068
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:25,680
be

1069
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,839
you're gonna have walking into a

1070
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:29,839
courtroom

1071
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,839
that's um that's really powerful and

1072
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:37,680
moreover having a having a dispassionate

1073
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,440
third party

1074
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,960
receive the information and

1075
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,079
be in a position where they can for

1076
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,400
example they would be able to say

1077
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,119
oh if it's appropriate oh i want to get

1078
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,440
law enforcement involved or oh i want to

1079
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,160
get

1080
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,640
some other stakeholder group involved

1081
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,760
but

1082
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,040
but by you working with

1083
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,960
your attorney to make those decisions

1084
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,400
that that's

1085
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,040
that's really brilliant um yeah i mean

1086
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,319
that's really the only way i can get

1087
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:09,200
through it

1088
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,560
yeah it's the only way i could get

1089
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,160
through because you do as a human you

1090
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,520
want to fight back

1091
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,800
you want to fight back you fight your

1092
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,119
flight at that point and i didn't want

1093
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,640
either of those options

1094
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,400
i didn't want out of my life and i did

1095
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,000
not want to fight this person back i

1096
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,160
just wanted to get away from them

1097
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,359
and the lawyer was the easiest and best

1098
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,359
case that i ever had because i didn't

1099
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,119
have to

1100
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,800
dive further into the rabbit hole

1101
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,319
reading things about myself that was

1102
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,160
that individual's job i won't say that

1103
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,520
it was cheap because it was

1104
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,880
not cheap but it was worth every single

1105
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,839
penny

1106
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,200
that i ever spent towards that

1107
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,680
so um posted in the chat

1108
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,359
for the attendees please check out the

1109
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,800
eval form um and

1110
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,079
laura the your you the timing and the

1111
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:00,960
pacing

1112
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,800
it was fabulous it was not too fast

1113
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,960
people were hanging on your words for

1114
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,920
sure

1115
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,319
we got a couple of pretty good questions

1116
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:11,200
here

1117
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,119
first one what do you wish a supportive

1118
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,079
loved one

1119
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,000
would have said to you early on in this

1120
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,280
process or what could have someone

1121
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,119
said to you to indicate that they were

1122
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,440
here for you and supporting you

1123
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,960
and they knew what was going on

1124
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,359
honestly i wish one person had just said

1125
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,119
your feelings are valid

1126
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:37,040
like that's it just how i felt was valid

1127
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,079
because in reality i never got the the

1128
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,240
protection order i never got the fmla i

1129
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,720
still felt that way

1130
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,240
i still felt like i didn't want to get

1131
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,160
out of bed i still felt like

1132
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,880
this person's words were correct so if

1133
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,839
anybody could have

1134
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,079
honestly just said your your feelings

1135
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:55,599
are valid you know how

1136
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,280
can we talk about this how can we help

1137
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,040
you you know get through this i don't

1138
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,640
want someone to fix it for me no one can

1139
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,599

1140
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,760
nobody's broken i don't i don't ever

1141
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,119
want to be looked at like i was broken

1142
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:05,760
or

1143
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,160
anything along those lines but i just

1144
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,480
felt so alone

1145
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,760
because i just thought no one would

1146
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,400
they would want to fix or tell you how

1147
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,920
you feel

1148
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,079
and i just needed somebody to understand

1149
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,119
how

1150
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,640
i was valid and what i was feeling

from the moment he hits first period to

1172
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,000
the end and no one's monitoring those

1173
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,359
chats they're monitoring them for cuss

1174
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,960
words or

1175
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,839
bad language sex language they're not

1176
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,040
monitoring them for

1177
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,720
you know calling someone a poop face all

1178
