1
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:13,280
all right

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,400
everybody so we are unfortunately

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,560
at the end let me

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,160
share up this slide deck

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,840
and see if this works as planned

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,039
because we've been having technical

7
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,400
issues today haven't we

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,360
so uh good news we had

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,280
zero incidents uh and three warnings

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,480
from the uh security team there were

11
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,079
other warnings from moderators in chat

12
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:46,960
but nothing

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,520
too major so i think that's uh pretty

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,719
successful

15
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,480
uh so i'm excited we also

16
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,559
had record breaking one thousand hundred

17
00:00:57,559 --> 00:00:59,120
1733

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,280
registration uh 462

19
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,799
students um and out of that we had

20
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,000
68 sponsors 76 speakers and villages

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,200
and 132 staff and volunteers we were

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,520
able to give out more than 200 free

23
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,520
tickets thanks to the people who

24
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,560
gave like 5 10 50

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,840
extra dollars when they bought their

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,000
tickets as well as defend khan

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,840

28
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,200
we had our badge workshop this year

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,960

30
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,680
village

31
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,000

shelf parts and there were awesome

35
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,960
participants i think everybody

36
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,560
managed to get through and get blinky

37
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,159

38
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,159

42
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,600
different locks that they had in their

43
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,280

it

73
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,080
so we of course want to thank

74
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,920
all of our sponsors without them we

75
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,760
couldn't have had this platform

76
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,480
which although it's got some ui and ux

77
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,720
issues and isn't quite intuitive i do

78
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,319
think it did work out we were able to

79
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,319
bounce between different stages go to

80
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,680
the different villages

81
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,760
hit the expo hall do some networking so

82
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,159
we couldn't have afforded that being you

83
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:28,799
know

84
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,799
running our non-profit and having this

85
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,239
platform without them

86
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,640
you'd really be shocked how much it can

87
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,400
be to run a virtual event

88
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,040
uh and if you think that's a lot wait

89
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,560
until you hear how much it takes to run

90
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,000
our event in vegas

91
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,519
so amid the uncertainty of

92
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,080
they still took time and money out of

93
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,319
their budgets to help us out

94
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,360

it

209
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,120
it was a bit chaotic but there were over

210
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,000

social media review your resumes

214
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,639
so if you know anyone who volunteers at

215
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,240
any conference give them a hand

216
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,240
finally i got a couple more things and

217
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,039
this one i

218
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,319
really hope sticks with you our slogan

219
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,160
this year was breaking boundaries bite

220
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,280
by bite

221
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,599
boundaries can come in many forms

222
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,120
self-imposed and those

223
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,039
imposed by your company even those

224
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,919
imposed by your society

225
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,000
when faced with problems it can seem

226
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,958
daunting

227
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,880
the most common advice is to pick one

228
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,120
specific area of a problem and go after

229
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,000
that

230
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,958
take that bite break it and then go to

231
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,240
the next

232
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,919
remember it only takes a bite to

233
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,440
overflow a buffer

234
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,040
we can break the systems that are

235
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,800
stopping us

236
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,200
this year many of us face a host of

237
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,320
different boundaries

238
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,760
problems and systemic issues i hope that

239
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,279
at this event you were able to make some

240
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,720
friends who in the future could be part

241
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,240
of your support network

242
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
and find the tools and skills to raise

243
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,760

244
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,959
