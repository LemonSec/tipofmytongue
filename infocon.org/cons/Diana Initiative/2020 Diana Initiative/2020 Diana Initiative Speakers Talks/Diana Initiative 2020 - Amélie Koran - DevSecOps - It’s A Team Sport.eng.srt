splunk you may have heard her speak

17
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,079
yesterday

18
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,520
and she's focused on helping

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,360
organizations transform

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,760
grow and secure themselves in the

21
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,559
ever-evolving world of technologies

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,320
and their accompanying challenges

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,000
something i think we all

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,720
uh need to to work and know a lot more

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,920
about right

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,040
so this is dev sec ops it is a

27
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,159
team sport this was pre-recorded so make

28
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,439
sure you do a hard

29
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,560
refresh on your screen to get the uh

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,280
video to start rolling and with that

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,320
let's go ahead

32
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,759
and get going hello

33
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,520
my name is amelie koran and i'm here to

34
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,200
present on devsecops

35
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,200
i view this as not a singular activity

36
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,920
but an activity that involves many

37
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,640
interdisciplinary teams

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,960
individuals and other resources this is

39
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,200
not a solo genius collection of tasks

40
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,720
plus it can be much more fun and

41
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,320
informative with teams

42
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,840
especially when you realize this work

43
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,840
can be gamified trust building and a

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,240
rewarding activity

45
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,000
here are some mandatory forward-looking

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,920
statements anything i say today is not

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,680
intended to discuss any company strategy

48
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,640
or direction

49
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,320
merely today on team building and

50
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,920
management for devops and devsecops

51
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,840
again i'm mommy cran and i work at

52
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,520
splunk as a technology advocate

53
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,399
in short i'm paid to tell stories prior

54
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,000
to splunk i spent 10 years in the

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,520
federal government in various technology

56
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,758
roles in several agencies

57
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,920
along the way i also worked in academia

58
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,200
and multiple parts of the commercial

59
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,760
sector

60
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,239
including several fortune 150 companies

61
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,920
i've sort of had all the roles i will be

62
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,360
speaking about today so hopefully the

63
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,560
perspectives i bring

64
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,560
will resonate no matter which role you

65
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,400
yourself find yourself in or work you

66
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,879
are involved in

67
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,959
devsecops derives its own name from

68
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,800
being an amalgamation of formerly three

69
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,640
separate common teams within most it

70
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,840
organizations

71
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,560
development security and operations with

72
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,400
the onslaught of new technologies and

73
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,519
methods to build

74
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,000
deploy and secure such solutions it's

75
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,160
become paramount to unite and streamline

76
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,319
these traditionally separate activities

77
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,080
this doesn't come without its own set of

78
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,319
challenges from turf wars to knowledge

79
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,360
and abilities

80
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,120
with most of the effort trying to wet up

81
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,800
the right puzzle pieces to ensure

82
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,519
overall team successes there's also no

83
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,280
success in the area given to a group of

84
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,440
rock stars or prima donnas but more from

85
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,800
the roadies insidemen

86
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,480
who work to make sure that the whole

87
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,400
show will be good rather than just try

88
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,239
to take center stage

89
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,239
finding identifying and nurturing the

90
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,080
staff and talent willing to work through

91
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,800
the change

92
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,040
not only within the it organization but

93
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,720
are also ambassadors to the rest of the

94
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,400
organization to help them through the

95
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,840
new ways of exploiting

96
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,519
the new ways of integrating technology

97
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,200
into business

98
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,120
the first step is communications and

99
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,879
that is defining how you will talk about

100
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:27,680
your work

101
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,239
ensuring that everybody involved gets it

102
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,080
and can easily share ideas and ensure

103
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,920
that nothing or very little is lost in

104
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,200
translation

105
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,200
as communication difficulties is one of

106
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,640
the top problems in

107
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,720
project execution and executive and

108
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,840
senior leadership

109
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,560
and a degrader of trust within teams

110
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,200
laying out

111
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,920
and defining your expected outcomes this

112
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,599
is not just from within your team but

113
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,040
ensuring

114
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,079
your customers

115
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,920
traditional development project

116
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,760
management followed a classic waterfall

117
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,720
process

118
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,640
relying on a critical path big bang

119
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,879
delivery targeted primarily towards

120
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,760
large enterprise

121
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,879
heavy lift projects some consider

122
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,519
safe or scaled agile framework to wedge

123
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,439
waterfall under a new title and call it

124
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,400
agile

125
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,840
and it gets adopted by those who are

126
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,599
risk adverse and wedded to not changing

127
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,720
their ways of working

128
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,759
easily sometimes it's called agile fall

129
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,759
and for those who've seen it fail maybe

130
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,360
agile fail

131
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,040
these missed adoptions can leave an

132
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,800
unpleasant taste in people's mouths and

133
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,479
less than ideal memories for those who

134
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,240
may be asked to move forward

135
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,759
towards a devops framework other times

136
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,360
some who are more willing to just go for

137
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,199
it rip the proverbial band-aid off of

138
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,560
whatever they have stitched together

139
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,080
between the development security and

140
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,680
operation teams

141
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,000
there are some who will start greenfield

142
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,080
picking to just move all at once

143
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,759
or slowly integrate devops as new

144
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,759
projects are on boarded

145
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,759
to make this successful regardless of

146
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,680
the approach is to develop a good clear

147
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,120
and documented change

148
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,960
management strategy that everybody

149
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,240
agrees to and is aware and adheres to

150
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,680
this helps work through not only

151
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,680
technical changes and modifications

152
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,199
but will help work through any issues

153
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,120
that may arise between non-technical

154
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,000
staff

155
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,840
business units and others who won't be

156
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,600
interacting with these teams daily

157
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,960
or are familiar with these types of

158
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,680
methodologies

159
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,759
your biggest challenge is managing size

160
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,120
and the complexity of the work ahead of

161
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,919
you

162
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,680
there is no product or service that can

163
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,080
you can buy your way out of it

164
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,840
approaching most large-scale enterprise

165
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,840
projects are very ceremonial

166
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,680
even those which are agile framework

167
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,919
based lots of having to do something

168
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,320
because that's just how it's been done

169
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,880
very rigid very structured a lot of

170
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,880
times these are built-in silos to serve

171
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,199
a single or very narrowly focused need

172
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,800
rather than looking broadly across the

173
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,639
needs the entire organization

174
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,240
possibly missing developing shared

175
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,840
capabilities because some of the

176
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,520
myopathy typically demonstrated from

177
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,360
those older models

178
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,360
building a platform thinking how it will

179
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,880
be maintained and operated

180
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,280
and what it may enable changes and how

181
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,639
teams can think about delivering

182
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,479
services and capabilities because it's

183
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,479
just based on a known way or method

184
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,639
that is supported a foundational

185
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,720
structure from which to build the house

186
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,160
office build stadium or cathedral upon

187
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,960
this often provides some modularity

188
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,400
allowing for new capabilities and

189
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,039
features to be pulled out or plugged in

190
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,199
using apis between services and features

191
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,720
is one example of how to enable this

192
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,759
capability

193
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,120
versus closed and customized

194
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,560
applications and services that were

195
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,840
tightly integrated

196
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,560
and not loosely coupled components much

197
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,919
like sumo wrestling

198
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,360
it may seem like a very odd and

199
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,840
structured activity but to succeed the

200
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,520
wrestlers need to be balanced and nimble

201
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,960
because it's a quick match

202
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,960
rounds lasting only a few seconds until

203
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,400
a winner is decided and the goal is

204
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,880
achieved

205
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,319
the teams at facebook popularized an

206
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:46,880
approach

207
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,120
to an agile development as to move

208
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,039
forward and break things

209
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,120
but what was really become the mantra is

210
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,440
to iterate smartly by failing forward

211
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,759
if you are trying something new ideating

212
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,199
and testing out concepts

213
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,360
you will also probably fail often

214
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,400
however

215
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,319
it should be blameless you're trying

216
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,759
something your team and organization

217
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,280
probably aren't familiar with in any

218
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:07,759
form

219
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,160
and have never ever done the biggest

220
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,599
change in most organizations

221
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,199
who followed a waterfall approach is

222
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,680
moving from a very linear delivery cycle

223
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,440
of features and capabilities to one of

224
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,840
small cycles in iterative delivery

225
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,759
there is little to no concept of big

226
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,440
bang delivery there but incremental

227
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,199
capabilities until it's finally reaching

228
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:25,759
the quality

229
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,840
specified for an mvp or minimal viable

230
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,080
product

231
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,319
along the way in devops teams it is to

232
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,000
define how that a system or application

233
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,680
will be run and maintained

234
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,599
this is sometimes often another big

235
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,120
change for those linear models

236
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,800
as they are delivered and then it's up

237
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,560
to everybody to figure out

238
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,400
rather than the integration of that

239
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,840
thinking in the planning and in the

240
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,560
development

241
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,520
and release cycles it is also vitally

242
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,280
important for these teams that adopt

243
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,039
agile and devops and eventually

244
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,160
devsecops

245
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,039
to push for permissionless innovation

246
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,280
nobody has a lock on good ideas

247
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,280
and that by exploring them often and at

248
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,599
any time inspiration may strike and end

249
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,360
up solving problems earlier and quicker

250
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,360
than a more rigid model

251
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,680
this also has a side benefit of reducing

252
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,599
the fear of failure among teams

253
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,680
by letting it be okay to fail a little

254
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,280
as long as you learn something from it

255
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,319
and share what you've learned

256
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,400
as you move forward towards devops the

257
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,400
skills and knowledge among team members

258
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,599
will be shared

259
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,599
an opportunity for cross training

260
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,240
optimizing resources and skill sets

261
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,240
some that exist in existing teams may be

262
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,080
reinforcing and complementary but they

263
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,519
can also highlight some that may be

264
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,839
missing during these transitions

265
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,440
fear often occurs when there's an

266
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,360
unknown future or potential situation

267
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,000
that differs from

268
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,559
expectations it's important to ensure

269
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,560
that team members understand their roles

270
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,800
responsibilities and scope of influence

271
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,640
and that it empowers them to do

272
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,040
good over time there will be an eventual

273
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,640
migration to a shared ownership and

274
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,000
responsibility model

275
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
with skills that can be interchanged or

276
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,680
swarmed when there is an increased need

277
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,120
or demand

278
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,120
everybody scrubs in who can help ensure

279
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,640
that things are kept on schedule and

280
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,240
that they meet delivery

281
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,240
devsecops only works if there's a shared

282
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,080
ownership and responsibility model

283
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,760
which is difficult in most organizations

284
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,279
where it's easier and common to point

285
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,720
fingers and cast blame

286
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,640
rather than to own up and work to solve

287
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,160
a problem and then move along with a

288
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,440
lesson learned

289
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,360
this isn't creating walls but helping

290
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,880
break them down and allow a healthy

291
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,320
attitude of asking for help when they

292
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,640
need it

293
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,440
most of you here come with this with a

294
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,120
hopefully sight grounding or experience

295
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,959
with devops or at least the familiarity

296
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:31,760
of the term

297
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,320
and that what it involves as you can see

298
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,040
devon ops

299
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,440
as a tightly overwrapped venn diagram

300
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,720
with fringes of operations and

301
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,160
development activities that exist

302
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,959
outside a complete overlay

303
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,720
the progression of this would be these

304
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,320
two areas being separate but as

305
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,160
efficiency and resiliency drives these

306
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,440
two roles together

307
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,200
i.t is not made up of just these two

308
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,880
groups alone they

309
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,440
need to involve and consider security

310
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,920
while devon ops began this transition

311
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,160
they have to be open and transparent and

312
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,320
that then they will build up trust

313
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,079
we base it on a healthy relationship

314
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,680
from sharing and communicating with one

315
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,320
another

316
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,839
and that building is a foundation of a

317
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,760
partnership rather than approaching its

318
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,360
adversaries with competing goals and

319
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,399
methods

320
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,320
we usually see security as the house and

321
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
no the stamp required for development

322
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,000
operation teams to proceed with pushing

323
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,839
something live a gate through which they

324
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,000
must pass it's always been pushed as a

325
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,200
painful exercise

326
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,839
and the last hop and hoop to go through

327
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,000
this often stated goals for devsecops is

328
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,640
to

329
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,320
move security further to the left on the

330
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,000
software development life cycle

331
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,920
this like the venn diagram has security

332
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,440
now as an overlay

333
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,720
another intersecting sphere and

334
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,000
eventually covering more and more of

335
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,959
that area

336
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,320
which should reflect more and more of

337
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,720
those integrations this eventually maybe

338
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,240
breaks down the house of no

339
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,000
maybe gets to the house of maybe and

340
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,279
possibly to the house of yes

341
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,079
we should as part of establishing a

342
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,680
clear and transparent communication is

343
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,440
to keep it at levels commensurate with

344
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,160
your target

345
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,600
audience and skills and awareness

346
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,640
if it is possibly too deep too technical

347
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,320
take the time to help educate

348
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,800
if you have the resources to do so it'll

349
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,560
help you refine your messaging but also

350
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,839
raise the skills of those who are

351
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:10,399
working

352
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,360
you are working with it'll carry over

353
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,040
later by reducing the overhead required

354
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,160
to communicate

355
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,880
security specifically is seen somewhat

356
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,040
mystical and misunderstood specialty

357
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,399
helping to drive that house and no

358
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,800
mentality and by avoiding asking the

359
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,399
tough questions or even the very basic

360
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,360
ones

361
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,720
pushing off topics like that if

362
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,160
addressed earlier and willingly could

363
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,000
save time and frustration from all

364
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,279
parties

365
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,680
use this as a teaching opportunity the

366
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,040
ability to cross train and share

367
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,800
knowledge and build more security aware

368
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,120
and

369
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,839
skilled people in your organization is

370
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,839
vital

371
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,880
as part of the aspects of organization

372
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,399
by their definition is that they

373
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,639
maintain some form of structure

374
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,560
groups will self-associate based upon

375
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,839
goals or skills

376
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,320
or some other arbitrary alignment those

377
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,920
are the creations of swim lanes

378
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
areas of expertise to support requested

379
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,240
outcomes but are often rigid with tasks

380
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,000
and resources being tossed from one to

381
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,880
another

382
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,040
the shared responsibility ends often at

383
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,920
the lane markers

384
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,440
as teams maintain behaviors that

385
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,040
purposefully isolate them

386
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,720
from possible adverse blow back and

387
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,040
effects but it may also isolate them

388
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,800
from being able to share in successes to

389
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,240
their fullest

390
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,240
other organizations are a bit less

391
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,600
loosely associated

392
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,440
where it's a free-for-all or this ball

393
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,120
pit metaphor used here

394
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,720
while everybody can play in the ball pit

395
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,279
it's chaotic and a little haphazard

396
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,040
it's transparent everybody sees

397
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,320
everything that's going on and

398
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,639
folks recognize one other needs help and

399
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,920
it's easier to extend it

400
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,519
it will get messy and the outcome may

401
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,120
not be prettier necessarily what they

402
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,320
have carefully planned

403
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,560
like those in a swim lane structure

404
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,560
regardless of which structure or lack

405
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,399
thereof that there is here

406
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,000
some organizations are resistant to

407
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,760
change of any kind and may be

408
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,440
intractable enough not to want the curb

409
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,399
their habits

410
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,839
those habitual ways of performing

411
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,000
businesses use of technology or even how

412
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,200
they look at their customers

413
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,079
users in market you can if you have the

414
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:00,959
right role

415
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,600
make this fun and not something to dread

416
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,920
overcoming aversion to risk and change

417
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,360
and can be the right catalyst to help

418
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:07,920
create a

419
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,639
successful high performing team and

420
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,680
successful activity

421
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,399
getting dosec ops together for your

422
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,000
organization will require time and

423
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,720
effort

424
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,720
it takes a lot to coagulate gather and

425
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,720
align everything for success

426
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,480
one of the best lessons you can learn or

427
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,079
take away from all of this is to pace

428
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,279
yourself

429
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,959
it's easy for a team or organization to

430
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,639
be over eager to do everything using

431
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,079
devops and agile

432
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,519
and the mantra from modern development

433
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,519
methodologies is to fail fast and break

434
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,000
things

435
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,079
all of facebook but they should also

436
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,440
fail forward and learn from those

437
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,560
experiences

438
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,720
if you do it too fast and do too much

439
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,480
you lose the feedback loop you get from

440
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,199
experience

441
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,880
and the ability to integrate into

442
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,399
changes and improvements

443
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,000
taking on way too much at first will

444
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,399
also hamper success because the volume

445
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,000
while working the percentages for

446
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,920
success is lower if you start out with a

447
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,279
few smaller projects

448
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,880
to ensure you and your teams have the

449
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,920
process down pat and near muscle memory

450
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,000
even the greatest athlete or musician or

451
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,920
other performer can make mistakes

452
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,600
regardless of how much they have done

453
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,120
and how often they've done it

454
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,120
so youtube has plenty of footages of

455
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,040
failure videos and blooper reels

456
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,720
but making these mistakes also allows

457
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,480
the individual to feel and remember

458
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,760
those base emotions

459
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,920
and know how good or bad they were to

460
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,040
reinforce this

461
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,199
this will hopefully help reduce the

462
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,480
severity of failures

463
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,279
and enhance the winds you can never

464
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,079
maximize

465
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,800
or minimize either as humans drive this

466
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,480
and we are prone to error

467
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,120
as it is human for us to do so this is a

468
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,000
cycle

469
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,639
devops and devsecops is iterative as

470
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,680
cycles will be

471
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,440
and part of the learning is learning how

472
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,880
to recover gracefully from these

473
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,240
mistakes

474
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,000
test for cases but also observe the

475
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,639
points where things may fail

476
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,160
i'm hopefully giving another talk on

477
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,680
this shortly on the dunning-kruger

478
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,560
effect of

479
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,240
for individuals teams and organizations

480
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,399
that tend to overestimate their ability

481
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,480
to adopt and adapt to rapidly changing

482
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,040
technologies methodologies and framework

483
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,120
the ego and overconfidence tend to reign

484
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,120
supreme either due to market pressures

485
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,720
leadership desires or the fear of

486
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,279
missing out when there is a new trend or

487
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,880
a new hotness that they must feel they

488
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,839
need to do

489
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,480
this slide covers an organizational

490
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,079
behavior that occurs after teams and

491
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,760
business units isolate

492
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,160
and to put it lightly yet selfish

493
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,839
probably from the historical operations

494
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:24,800
of an organization

495
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,279
politics time and tradition behaviors

496
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,120
are learned and passed on

497
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,880
some by design and some just by

498
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,639
happenstance in need

499
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,959
the ways devops and devsecops can help

500
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,639
is to nurture the good ones and work to

501
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,120
dispose of the bad or unwanted ones

502
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,800
one of the first habits which can be

503
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,160
good or bad depending on how it's

504
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,880
universally exercised is communication

505
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,800
communicating your strategies plans

506
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,560
goals and your tie into the business

507
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,519
outcomes and mission of your

508
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,560
organization

509
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,320
your staff and your devops teams help

510
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,920
build the trust that is necessary to

511
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,600
have a unified vision

512
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,519
this also helps create community and

513
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,880
ties into the needs of everybody

514
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,800
involved in execution

515
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,519
i say here fishing for the village not

516
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,959
the boat captain

517
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,480
which is a parable to do the work

518
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,320
required to support the entire community

519
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,519
and organization

520
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,759
rather than just one person regardless

521
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,880
of their role or stature in the

522
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,240
organization

523
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,160
an organization will always be more than

524
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,160
one person no matter what it

525
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,880
may be perceived or marketed as success

526
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,880
rides on people not a person

527
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,040
and working together to common tools

528
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,880
understanding and a lexicon

529
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,320
and methods are part of the support

530
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,720
structure for devsecops and devops

531
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,639
a referenceable framework acts as the

532
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,079
scaffolding needed to handle

533
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,120
all this and handed off leadership that

534
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,120
is required to make this successful

535
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,560
is that which gives themselves to

536
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,800
support rather than pull along

537
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,399
while a leader can lay out the path and

538
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,399
align the resources and help be the

539
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,600
arbiter of choice

540
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,000
the team must follow and leadership must

541
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
make that appetizing and interesting for

542
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,880
folks to follow

543
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,639
the challenge for most technically

544
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,399
oriented people are soft skills

545
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,399
we also we often revel in our

546
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,160
awkwardness and single-mindedness

547
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,759
towards achieving goals

548
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,599
this is healthy but since we're also

549
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,000
dealing with breathing live human beings

550
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,079
we need to communicate often to others

551
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,160
outside our own expertise

552
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,599
in the business world this is talking to

553
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,280
folks responsible for various business

554
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,199
units budget accounting procurement

555
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,919
acquisition legal and hr they consume

556
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,359
various aspects of what an it

557
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,359
organization provides and as a subset

558
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,039
what devops and devsecops

559
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,679
team would generate capturing that value

560
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,440
at those touch points but also making

561
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,799
sure that that value is collected and

562
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,799
shown back is vitally important

563
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,679
for quantifying the worth it has

564
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,919
traditionally been seen as a cost center

565
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,679
a utility you pay for for keeping the

566
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,120
bits flowing over the network and the

567
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,960
spreadsheets from crashing

568
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,720
selling up innovation and modernization

569
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,000
is hard because it's more

570
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,039
conceptual than tactile let people

571
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,799
support you based on faith

572
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,960
often especially if this is something

573
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,200
new for your organization

574
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,880
aligning your work between the business

575
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,720
goals and the desired outcome

576
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,480
helps tie the value of your work to

577
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,000
those business lines

578
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,919
it makes it intimately tied to the core

579
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,600
operations of the organization

580
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,160
rather than just the support mechanism

581
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,679
innovation can also assist with

582
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,520
re-engineering business processes

583
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,280
which may have become a little messy and

584
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,760
convoluted from the original design

585
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,679
roi or return on investment is still a

586
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,760
concept often flogged for organizations

587
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,440
as the only and overall measure of

588
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,480
success

589
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,400
but as not all organizations have a

590
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
profit motive the concept of return on

591
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,320
spending resources to recover the

592
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,120
investment

593
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,960
isn't always a good measure let alone

594
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,640
something that should drive a kpi

595
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,440
or key performance index use measures

596
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,200
that address the outcomes both

597
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,120
qualitative and quantitative

598
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,640
that can be instrumented from the work

599
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,160
stream and development life cycles

600
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,320
so you're the first audience publicly

601
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,600
seeing these which are part of my

602
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,039
research at splunk

603
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,360
the ideal destination is the ultimate

604
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,520
venn diagram of overlapping capabilities

605
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,559
and functions

606
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,240
with the chuwi center of a well-balanced

607
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,919
devsecops framework

608
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,679
the little specialized function in areas

609
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,280
that may still be under the preview of a

610
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,880
single or dual conjoined function

611
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,440
such as devops secops appsec and so

612
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,640
forth

613
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,320
as an organization matures and teams

614
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,000
work closer build trust

615
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,760
and share responsibility and outcomes

616
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,080
these areas are smaller and smaller

617
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,160
the arrows are affinity arrows or

618
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,000
gravity arrows which are there to show

619
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,960
the balance

620
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,799
or out of balance forces that can act on

621
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,880
the process and relationship

622
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,400
left are all the it silos aligned

623
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,320
this is an all-in organization that has

624
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,400
either been born directly into devsecops

625
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,840
or could quickly shift

626
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,480
to get buy into that framework strategic

627
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,080
and tactical planning to keep things in

628
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,320
balance and support work from

629
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,919
now on in the center is the we have no

630
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,280
idea how to work together

631
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,360
the silos of silos considered the

632
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,120
opposite of the all-in persona

633
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,320
but it's actually potentially a

634
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,240
beneficial state

635
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,760
possibly rudderless and where they want

636
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,520
to go and how they get there

637
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,000
um you know the influence and successes

638
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,360
are possible and

639
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,120
heavy lifts may be required to clean up

640
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,120
correct and correct bad habits

641
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,840
the lower left or all dev all the time

642
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,200
these are organizations that work and

643
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,799
run on the back of developers

644
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,480
they quickly iterate and id through

645
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,559
product delivery sometimes at the

646
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,919
expense of well-documented and

647
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,240
resilience and secure methodologies for

648
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,159
service and solution delivery

649
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,840
how to run it is seen as secondary to

650
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,120
getting it out the door and into

651
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,559
customer hands

652
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,480
the lower right or fortress enterprise

653
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,559
or very minimal new operations and

654
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:25,919
development is an organization that

655
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,520
works in a low trust model both

656
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,120
internally and externally

657
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,960
they limp along either high security

658
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,400
batten down the hatches approach to

659
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,000
system access and exposure

660
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,600
they run hardened systems that won't

661
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,039
take to new development features or

662
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,080
operational models

663
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,600
without a laborious effort within

664
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,120
security teams

665
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,720
in the upper right is an inventory dev

666
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,960
team very heavy ops focused or minimized

667
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,799
or marginalized security

668
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,480
organizations where it's all about

669
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,600
running the business or keeping the

670
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,280
lights on to support activities as they

671
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:51,919
are

672
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,440
there's little investment into active

673
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,960
modernization and transformation

674
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,720
activities

675
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,400
reactive utilization to security

676
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,240
practices as well

677
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,559
upper left are the well oil devops it's

678
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,000
an antagonistic or

679
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,919
edge security role an organization that

680
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,919
is low friction for devops activities at

681
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,520
the expense of security

682
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,120
it avoids security involvement until the

683
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,120
release or on demand rather than

684
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,679
integration into the process

685
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,919
devsecops and even devops is still

686
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:20,799
relatively new

687
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,480
so each organization's experience and

688
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,159
path will be different

689
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,760
this is experiential learning you will

690
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,000
need to find your own way with doing it

691
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,760
best practice and observing the failures

692
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,600
and successes of peers

693
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,760
there will be some pain but then again

694
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,600
this is all about teamwork

695
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,840
and one head is not as good as two or

696
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,520
five or twenty

697
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,120
there's no lift and shift for what you

698
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,039
will work for for devops

699
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,360
and devsecops yes there are guides how

700
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,360
to's and even plenty of talks like this

701
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,559
on how to prepare

702
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,799
transition and succeed but your business

703
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,120
and operations are yours uniquely

704
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,720
there's a human element to all of this

705
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,320
and that's the ability to adapt to

706
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,440
change

707
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,360
humans are exceptionally great at this

708
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,280
we advance by running down the right

709
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,919
and wrong roads the adaptation is

710
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,760
through the resiliency that's built in

711
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,240
us humans our ability to use language

712
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:08,799
and express

713
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,720
and share concepts allows us to evolve

714
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,440
faster and in most cases better

715
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,360
not that we're infallible i would guess

716
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,280
for every outstanding success or

717
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,360
plenty of failures there are lessons

718
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,039
learned however and that should give

719
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,240
some comfort

720
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,000
to say we're breaking new ground might

721
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,520
still be a misnomer here

722
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,200
this is almost on the level of initial

723
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,720
space exploration

724
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,400
when we've been told to do things better

725
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,080
and faster and sometimes

726
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,760
the modicum of resources and told to

727
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,559
spin gold thread out of lead

728
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,240
each industry is trying to find their

729
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,240
own way around on doing this

730
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,120
seeing what works what it doesn't apply

731
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,320
to past operations

732
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,159
and align it to desired outcomes for the

733
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,760
work they want to do

734
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,000
matching what kpis measures of

735
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,799
performance

736
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,559
operating models and what will be

737
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,240
developed possibly on the fly

738
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,080
it will be important to instrument that

739
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,640
process to ensure that you can quantify

740
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,640
process in both qualitative and

741
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,320
quantitative measures

742
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,720
some of these will be feels rather than

743
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,640
hard and fast bankable numbers because

744
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,480
you're dealing with the impression of

745
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,600
people

746
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,760
roi is still a fungible number in most

747
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,520
cases that is easily

748
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,360
as it is to apply to your environment

749
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,120
and enterprise and can't be lifted from

750
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,000
others

751
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
we can model it from example but it's

752
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,240
not an obvious application of those

753
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,840
techniques enjoy the journey

754
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,120
value your team allow people to shine

755
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,120
but don't rely on a solitary genius to

756
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,559
make all this happen

757
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,320
you can only get the ball and goal if

758
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,520
everybody works together efficiently

759
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,960
thank you have a nice evening
