narrative version individuals in tech

32
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,040
and how to break down barriers to

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,720
contribution for them within oss

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,479

thank you rent thank you hi everybody

40
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,399
thank you so much for joining me and

41
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,360
welcome to

42
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,360
breaking down barriers to information

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,920
security for neurodivergent individuals

44
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,600
uh we only have 20 minutes so i'm

45
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,680
actually going to jump right in and

46
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,320
get started i hope you all can read my

47
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,119
captions

48
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,240
and i'm going to get going here

49
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,119
hopefully so first things first we're

50
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,000
going to define

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,120
what is neurodiversity neurodiversity is

52
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,120
broadly defined in academia and across

53
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,879
mental health professions as an umbrella

54
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:15,280
term

55
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,040
for the following autism add adhd

56
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,480
tourettes dyspraxia dyslexia dyscalculia

57
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,400
specific speech conditions sensory

58
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,760
processing conditions and

59
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,040
many more um i'd like to make a note

60
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,560
that among many neurodivergent

61
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,840
individuals there's been a recent

62
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,519
movement to accept and embrace the

63
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:34,840
validity

64
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,000
of specific speech conditions

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,560
and self-diagnosis and our own unique

66
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,080
lived experiences

67
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,000
and when discussing neurodiversity

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,840
remember an individual is neurodivergent

69
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,280
rather than neurodiverse

70
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,480
so first things first

71
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,680
we'd like to address the challenge of

72
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,599
contributing to open source software

73
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,360
contributing to open source is often

74
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,280
recommended as a way for neurodivergent

75
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,959
individuals to kick-start their career

76
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,000
in tech

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,560
contributing to open source is usually

78
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,000
seen as a way for new developers to

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,360
apply what they've learned to a project

80
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,480
and learn to work with the team if they

81
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,239
haven't already

82
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,319
so the problem with that is that

83
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,680
contributing to open source

84
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,920
can be really daunting and it's even

85
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,280
inaccessible for many

86
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,519
neurodivergent individuals due to

87
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,280
excessive use of jargon in open source

88
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,239
communities

89
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,480
having unclear contribution guidelines

90
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,840
there's no one to turn to when they have

91
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,560
a question

92
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,840
and there's often really lengthy

93
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,760
confusing documentation to read before

94
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,560
they can even get started contributing

95
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,480
when suggesting open source as a way to

96
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,840
kick start one's career

97
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,680
you've really got to make sure that the

98
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,680
project's documentation is accessible

99
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,440
contributor pathways have clearly

100
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,680
defined paths for progression

101
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,319
and that there's a directly responsible

102
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,280
individual

103
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,519
that neurodivergent people can go to

104
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,519
with any questions that they might have

105
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,200
having that contact point that they can

106
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,360
go to if they face a bug in their setup

107
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,120
or if they have a question about if

108
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,200
about that pull request is huge

109
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,720
it's really nice to have that person

110
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,080
that they can go to and be like i have a

111
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,360
question i have a problem something's

112
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,560
not working for me

113
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,760
can you help me so they're not having to

114
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,159
wander through your github documentation

115
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,280
trying to find

116
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,079
whoever an issue is assigned to and pray

117
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,880
that they might help them

118
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,199
so let's talk really quick about

119
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,960
roadblocks to career advancement

120
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,600
there's so many of these and traditional

121
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,639
interview processes

122
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,199
are designed with bias ingrained in them

123
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,759
the biggest example i can see of this is

124
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,560
by far

125
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,800
interviewing for culture fit if your

126
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,560
organization is interviewing for culture

127
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,160
fit you are

128
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,639
inherently biased in a lot of ways

129
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,600
against neurodivergent individuals

130
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,800
because a lot of times culture fit just

131
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,600
means

132
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
we want someone to answer this interview

133
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,000
question in a way that is

134
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
accepted as socially um

135
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,919
socially acceptable by neuro

136
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,840
neurotypical individuals so

137
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,440
it's a it's an unspoken cheat sheet

138
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,520
and it's a really large bias that is

139
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,320
hard to overcome i would say for a lot

140
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,680
of neurodivergent individuals

141
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,400
unspoken rules of social interaction

142
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,240
often lead to lost career opportunities

143
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,039
for neurodivergent individuals

144
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,120
some neurodivergent people can be seen

145
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,199
as and are often unfairly labeled by

146
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,199
neurotypical colleagues as disruptive

147
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,520
abrasive or seen as rocking the boat due

148
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,440
to their communication style

149
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,120
and this can lead to less pathways for

150
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,639
furthering their careers and in some

151
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,400
cases mainly to performance improvement

152
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:38,960
plans

153
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,360
layoffs or termination and i have a dog

154
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,639
and he is barking like you would not

155
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,880
believe right now

156
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,800
the performance improvement plan process

157
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,560
is overwhelmingly designed to punish

158
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,080
neurodivergent workers

159
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,600
for not performing to arbitrary

160
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
neurotypical standards of production

161
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,039
output and project scope so if you're

162
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,280
thinking about putting a neurodivergent

163
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,199
person on a performance improvement plan

164
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,120
i highly suggest maybe not doing that

165
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,160
so what can you as an employer do

166
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,720
good question so let's talk about some

167
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,520
recommendations for employers

168
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,639
to actually succeed when it comes to

169
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,680
interviewing retaining and attracting

170
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,000
neurodivergent talent

171
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,680
reimagine how you look at the interview

172
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,479
process this looks like avoiding smart

173
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,639
style interview questions

174
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,880
those tell me about a time when

175
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,400
questions are really difficult for

176
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,080
another divergent people because they'll

177
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,479
answer those questions brutally honestly

178
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,160
oftentimes their interviewer is

179
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,400
neurotypical and doesn't want a brutally

180
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,280
honest answer

181
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,360
but they won't tell their neurodivergent

182
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,120
candidate that

183
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,720
implement screening processes where you

184
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,560
don't use video software and try to

185
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,199
limit your bias as much as possible

186
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,280
and this is really important because a

187
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,880
lot of bias is

188
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,520
inherent in video screening so whenever

189
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,000
you can

190
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,400
try to do um i guess the term would be

191
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,160
low visibility interviews where you know

192
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,280
as little about your candidate as

193
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,800
possible and hire them for what they can

194
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,880
do rather than

195
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,120
whatever your perceived notions of them

196
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,039
are

197
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,800
set up neurodivergent employees for

198
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,160
success with a new approach to

199
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,440
performance reviews

200
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,880
and work with people to create their

201
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,800
performance goals rather than assigning

202
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,960
them arbitrarily without their input

203
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,479
if people have a stake in their own

204
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:29,759
success they're much more likely to

205
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,560
succeed

206
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,639
ask them what success looks like to them

207
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,319
and figure out where they'd like to be

208
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,639
in terms of their career

209
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,160
you can also encourage creation of

210
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,360
employee resource groups for

211
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,280
neurodivergent employees to connect with

212
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,560
one another

213
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,639
and employers should collaborate with

214
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,800
neurodivergent individuals themselves to

215
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,400
remove barriers to paid work and open

216
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,599
source contribution for

217
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,080
neurodivergent individuals primarily

218
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,759
talk to us not about us

219
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,400
that's a really big thing to remember is

220
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,319
that people like to talk

221
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,720
about neurodiversity but they don't

222
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,520
actually talk

223
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,400
to neurodivergent individuals we're here

224
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,240
most of us would like to talk to you i'm

225
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,199
sure

226
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,879
and we'd love to have input

227
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,800
on discussions that especially impact

228
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,919
our lives

229
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,799
and our careers

230
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,680
so how can we improve information

231
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,280
security how can we

232
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,840
make this better i'm going to leave you

233
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,800
with

234
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,919
a few thoughts here to take away

235
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,599
and we can ruminate on those and

236
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,399
hopefully brainstorm some suggestions

237
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,320
so what do you feel that we as a

238
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,519
community can do

239
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,159
to improve the information security open

240
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,760
source contributor experience

241
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,360
career trajectory and learning outcomes

242
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,680
for those that are neurodivergent

243
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,360
and how can we best introduce those

244
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,440
solutions in a real meaningful way that

245
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,680
enacts change in the community

246
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,839
and lastly what are one or two things

247
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,120
that you feel would make a career in

248
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,800
information security more accessible to

249
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,399
those that are neurodivergent

250
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,760
and how are you going to build upon what

251
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,120
you've learned today to implement those

252
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,959
in your own organization and communities

253
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,040
so last thing is

254
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,560
if you're interested in participating in

255
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,080
the continuous improvement of an open

256
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,600
source git lab repository building on

257
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,959
what we've learned in this session

258
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,240
please feel free to contact me on

259
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,720

um put a chat message asking for

270
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,800
questions

271
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,839
but i wanted to share a um a comment

272
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,120
from kim crawley

273
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,800
which i feel like is really cool

274
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,880
profound the number one thing that harms

275
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,080
disabled people

276
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,560
is when able people act as experts about

277
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,640
us

278
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,560
that's very that is true is well spoken

279
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,360
as

280
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,800
super true um

281
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,599
so i have a question

282
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,760
um you you touch briefly on

283
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,399
um you know the the kind of responsible

284
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,120
person

285
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,800
who who's kind of onboarding

286
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,440
contributors within oss communities

287
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,720
um do you have any kind of

288
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,839
recommendations on how they can be more

289
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,000
more inclusive and remove barriers

290
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,680
would say for onboarding and open source

291
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,680
communities having a clear contributor

292
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,880
guide is huge

293
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,279
having people that are whose job it is

294
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,040
to actually help new people

295
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,560
is great a good example of this is

296
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,079
kubernetes there's the contributor

297
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:44,800
experience

298
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,680
sig and the contributor experience sig

299
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,000
helps new contributors get started

300
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,200
and they also have a really well

301
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
detailed contributor guide that lays out

302
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,640
the contributor process from start to

303
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,839
finish what you can expect when you

304
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:56,880
submit a pr

305
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,920
how to do so what bots will be running

306
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,600
how to sign the cli

307
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,839
etc so making sure that all that

308
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,600
information is easily accessible

309
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,880
and that there's somebody to talk to if

310
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,240
you have a question and you know where

311
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,120
that person is

312
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,800
and who they are is huge

313
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,200
thank you and i've got actually some

314
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,120
kind of adjacent questions from mary

315
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,399
wiseman and emily gladstone cole

316
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,079
and they asked what are some suggestions

317
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,399
for better interview techniques

318
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,360
and also can you talk more about better

319
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,160
interview questions

320
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,959
and how to write them absolutely

321
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,160
interview questions are

322
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,959
great and i love them but i also would

323
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,200
really love for people to get to know

324
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,440
neurodivergent individuals as just that

325
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,560
individuals

326
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,640
when you have interview questions that

327
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,640
are like tell me about a time when

328
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,399
they really don't you get don't get to

329
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,680
know somebody as an individual because

330
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,279
you're forcing them to

331
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,360
regurgitate a scripted answer to a

332
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,399
scripted question

333
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,000
that doesn't allow for flexibility or

334
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,519
creativity you basically want you're

335
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,200
basically testing their

336
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
memory and how quick they can think on

337
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
their feet which for some neurodivergent

338
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,880
people is really difficult to do

339
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,560
i know for me i've had interview

340
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,240
questions where hours later i think of

341
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,040
an answer

342
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,639
and i'm like didn't say that in the

343
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,440
interview well now what

344
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,720
so i think that really revising your

345
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,240
interview questions to get to know

346
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,240
somebody without

347
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,279
expecting a scripted automatic answer is

348
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:21,839
great

349
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,360
so really making sure that your

350
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,760
questions um

351
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,040
get you the answers you want in your

352
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,040
recruiting process and not i wouldn't

353
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,079
actually you know what i wouldn't even

354
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,519
give you the answers you want because

355
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,040
that's a bias in and of itself

356
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,000
so you've really got to work on that um

357
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,600
it's such a hard thing interviewing

358
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,000
especially

359
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,399
for neurodivergent people because

360
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,360
there's such an

361
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,399
unspoken set of rules to interviewing

362
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,639
that is so skewed toward neurotypical

363
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,200
behavior and neurotypical responses that

364
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,079
we will never know honestly and if we if

365
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:52,800
we are doing

366
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,480
we're probably masking and that's

367
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,200
emotionally um taxing too

368
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,240
so it's it's it's hard and i would say

369
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,760
that

370
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,600
as much as you can revise your interview

371
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,440
questions to be

372
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,680
less scripted and allow for flexibility

373
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,200
and when and how you answer that

374
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,320
question

375
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,040
that's really fantastic advice thank you

376
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,920
um i have another

377
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,160
um some more wisdom from kim crawley

378
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,680
coming in hot

379
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,440
i think too much emphasis on degrees

380
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,120
inserts an industry barrier for

381
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,600
neurodivergent people the public school

382
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,040
system failed me

383
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,399
i dropped out of school i wasn't

384
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,480
formally diagnosed with autism adhd

385
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,800
until i was 35.

386
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,560
that's very finally true

387
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,440
until i was in my 30s as well it's rough

388
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,880
well

389
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,240
um rivka skidmore uh is

390
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,240
asking your opinion on a particular

391
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,360
interview question that we've all gotten

392
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,639
which is describe something that you're

393
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,519
passionate about

394
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,920
i like that one but i also don't because

395
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,639
again

396
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,639
this falls into the don't answer the

397
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,920
question honestly trap

398
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,839
they want you to answer it but they

399
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,519
don't want you to answer in a way that

400
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,839
makes you

401
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,079
seem weird and i air quote that

402
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,079
because autistic people often have what

403
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,519
is known as special interests

404
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,760
mine for example is the abc show once

405
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,760
upon a time please i beg of you talk to

406
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,440
me on twitter but once upon a time

407
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,880
it will bring you joy and i'm pretty

408
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,480
sure that a job interviewer is not going

409
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,000
to want to hear about once upon a time

410
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,399
for

411
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,079
20 minutes or however long they want me

412
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,000
to talk about that i'm also pretty sure

413
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,279
they're not going to hear about making

414
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,079
candles

415
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,360
neither of these things they want to

416
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,120
hear about they want you to have a hobby

417
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,480
and they want you to see that you have a

418
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,399
life outside of work but

419
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,000
the truth is they want to hear oh i code

420
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,600
outside of work they don't want to hear

421
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,519
about the cool stuff you actually do

422
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,480
and that's sad so if you're going to ask

423
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,440
somebody

424
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,399
like something like that i would say

425
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,079
expect an honest answer especially if

426
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,000
your candidate is neurodivergent

427
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,399
i don't expect to hear something like

428
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,399
all i do in my spare time is code i eat

429
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,279
sleep and breathe

430
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,399
code nobody does that and if they do

431
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,639
god is blessed more power to you but i'm

432
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,279
not that person

433
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,120
um so here's a really interesting

434
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,160
question from jennifer

435
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,959
santiago um they asked do you

436
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:09,920
self-identify as

437
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,880
autistic when you apply for jobs heck

438
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,760
yes

439
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,160
but i will say that i have done an a b

440
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,600
split test on not doing that

441
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,680
and doing that i have checked the tiki

442
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,360
box that says i have a disability and i

443
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,120
have not checked it and i have seen that

444
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,240
when i do not

445
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,320
check the tiki box i get less auto

446
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,839
replies that say no we don't want you

447
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,519
for a job which i'm pretty sure is

448
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,320
illegal

449
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,839
but they do it anyway so that sucks

450
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,839
um so i'm i do self dx and what i like

451
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:38,800
is seeing the

452
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,040
um not the federal one where it's like

453
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,480
have you ever had a disability tell the

454
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,360
government

455
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,639
the one where it's like they give you

456
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,320
the option to tell them yourselves they

457
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,759
have their own form on

458
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,839
greenhouse where you can add like do you

459
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,360
have a disability do you identify as a

460
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,800
member of the lgbt community you can

461
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,639
check the ticket box those i like

462
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,800
because that gives you an opportunity to

463
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,839
say more about yourself but it also

464
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,440
doesn't automatically get you in the no

465
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,480
pile which

466
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,000
checking the federal ticket box i find

467
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
does so

468
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,720
yes i identify as autistic when i count

469
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,199
on job

470
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,720
applications and i think that in a lot

471
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,519
of cases the way i see it is if i check

472
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,199
that box and they don't want me then

473
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,880
they didn't want me they don't want me

474
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,399
to bring all of me to work then they

475
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:18,880
didn't

476
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,399
want me i think you don't want them

477
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,360
exactly if they don't want 100 somebody

478
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,079
is 100

479
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,320
and that includes their disability then

480
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,279
they don't they

481
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,399
i don't know who they're looking for but

482
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,680
it's certainly not me so

483
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,920
um we've got a great question from adina

484
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,360
e um

485
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,079
awesome which is where can you find

486
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,839
resources to help

487
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,240
neurodivergent people learn and excel in

488
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,440
infosec

489
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,279
most people i've talked to you to self

490
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,480
teach figure it out on your own i think

491
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,600
that's something that most of us have

492
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,480
heard

493
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,880
um but how and where do you find people

494
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,399
to teach to

495
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,680
neurodiverse individual states i

496
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,079
honestly love the work that the bbc is

497
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,959
doing the bbc cape initiative is great

498
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,559
um the bbc hasn't a whole neurodivergent

499
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,400
um arm of its uh entire workforce that

500
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,319
they're really trying hard to work on

501
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,919
that and the uk is actually really great

502
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:14,319
about

503
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,799
neurodiversity in general as opposed to

504
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,439
the uf

505
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,199
in a lot of ways they have a dyspraxia

506
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,480
institute that's really great for

507
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,199
example

508
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,280
whereas the us is just now catching on

509
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,559
to dyspraxia

510
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,720
in so many ways um i have dyspraxia as

511
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,960
well as being autistic and just calculus

512
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,400
so i'm a wonderful unicorn of

513
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,360
neurodiversity

514
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,919
but um i really think that self learning

515
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:34,400
is

516
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,760
difficult in a lot of ways especially

517
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,160
for people that have add i have edd too

518
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,919
and self learning is really hard for me

519
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,000
because it requires so much

520
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,840
uh time management and executive

521
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,200
function so

522
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,679
i really think that self learning is a

523
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,600
slippery slope for people that are

524
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,799
neurodivergent

525
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,000
and i would say i would recommend really

526
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,520
building a community if you can

527
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,039
and that's where the open source thing

528
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,280
comes in handy and encouraging employee

529
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,000
resource groups

530
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
because if you have a neurodivergent

531
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,200
employee resource group

532
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,799
and you have an open source community

533
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,320
where neurodivergent people are free to

534
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,679
interact and build their own communities

535
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,039
they'll help one another

536
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,960
and we can come together as a team to

537
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,160
accomplish more

538
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,840
and that way if you're around other

539
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,679
neurodivergent individuals

540
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,360
there's going to be more tips that are

541
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,720
actually going to work for you

542
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,240
in terms of how you learn and how you

543
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,799
process information

544
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,919
very cool thank you um

545
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,799
and i think we've got time for one or

546
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,840
two more questions

547
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,240
that would be great yeah i'm happy to

548
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,720
answer any that anybody has for sure

549
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,960
um

550
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,440
this has been a real joy

551
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,440
thank you yeah uh this has been

552
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,200
fantastic

553
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,400
um i guess i would be curious about kind

554
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,480
of

555
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,520
any any kind of quick quick hit

556
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,600
recommendations you have

557
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,240
for individuals who are not um

558
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,120
self-identified as

559
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,280
neurodivergent to be better allies

560
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,840
within communities

561
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,520
i would say go check out the autistic

562
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,280
self-advocacy network that's a pretty

563
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,960
great place to start

564
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,160
like i said the dyspraxia foundation

565
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,760
i would definitely check out um

566
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,840
twitter's a great place on the hashtag

567
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,919
actually autistic is really great

568
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:33,039
um and then i would say that just um

569
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,200
you start your own start that dialogue

570
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,360
in your company start the dialogue and

571
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,960
get an employee resource group get

572
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,559
people together get them talking

573
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,360
because you never know what you're going

574
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,200
to learn about people people may have

575
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,039
been asking and you won't even know

576
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,280
so until you ask they might have felt

577
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,559
uncomfortable so if you get that ball

578
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,480
rolling and you start that discussion

579
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,080
without like putting people on the spot

580
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,000
it's really nice because like a lot of

581
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,200
people are shy

582
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,760
they might not want to talk about how

583
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,440
they're handling it but if you give them

584
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,360
the door to say i'm struggling i am

585
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,320
neurodivergent

586
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,400
i've been masking and it's been really

587
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,520
hard for me

588
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,679
you might end up finding out a lot more

589
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:08,880
about your co-workers and having an

590
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,400
opportunity to help them succeed in ways

591
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,520
that you couldn't even imagine

592
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,799
