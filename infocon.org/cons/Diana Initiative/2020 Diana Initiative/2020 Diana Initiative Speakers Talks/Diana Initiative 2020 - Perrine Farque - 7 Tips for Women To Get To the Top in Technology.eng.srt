female leader in technology

65
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,000
i have learned how to become part of the

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,120
leadership team

67
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,400
in a very male dominated industry i can

68
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,640
teach you how to fast track your career

69
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,560
as a woman in technology

70
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,440
as i've worked um at some very large

71
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,840
tech

72
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,400
companies including facebook and even at

73
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,480
some unicorn startups that went public

74
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,400
during my time at the company

75
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,480
and i'm talking from personal work

76
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,319
experience rather than

77
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,839
theoretical research

78
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,640
and just a few words about uh my company

79
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,959
inspired yemen so we are a london-based

80
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,159
diversity agency in tech we help tech

81
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,319
companies hit the diversity goals

82
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,400
through sharing our personal experience

83
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,800
in tech

84
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,400
so why does it matter to have female

85
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,440
leaders in tech

86
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,560
um as we can see from the recent press

87
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,920
coverage

88
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,920
sexism is still very present in

89
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,959
technology

90
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,440
and the gender gap is still prominent

91
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,440
and even increasing since the beginning

92
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,920
of kovid and the pandemic

93
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,319
in fact more women have been pushed out

94
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,159
of the workforce

95
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,840
in every industry including in

96
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,680
technology since the beginning of the

97
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,760
pandemic

98
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,560
as research shows as well diverse teams

99
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,360
um

100
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,440
present many benefits to tech companies

101
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,200
you know diverse teams create more

102
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,959
innovative solutions

103
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,440
they are more adept at solving difficult

104
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,319
problems

105
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,239
they achieve better financial results

106
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,000
and they create technology that are made

107
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,680
for diverse users so

108
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,319
especially in the technology industry

109
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:56,879

you to boost your career as a woman

117
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,079
in technology is to find allies and

118
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,079

119
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,120
um alliance can be sponsors

120
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,280
champions amplifiers advocates or

121
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,320
confidence

122
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,040
really allies are here to uh speak up

123
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,080
about you

124
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,080
um in a positive way even when you're

125
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,080
not in the room so

126
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,479
um they um you know if you share your

127
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,440
career goals with

128
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,320
allies and mentors and sponsors um and

129
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,400
you if you ask for stretch assignments

130
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,160
and learning opportunities and if you

131
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,440
ask for recommendations during

132
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,639
performance reviews

133
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,800
allies will help you boost your career

134
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,080
so

135
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,440
this is a picture here of my vp of sales

136
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:53,759
at

137
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,479
one of my produce tech companies and he

138
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,199
was

139
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,840
my sponsor since day one and he would

140
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,759
say things like oh perrin made a really

141
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,520
valid point in that meeting

142
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,000
he would nominate me for promotions he

143
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,520
would put my name

144
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,320
forward for attending the company sales

145
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,680
achievers club so

146
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,759
he would be my biggest champion inside

147
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,759
the organization even when i was not in

148
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,280
the room

149
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,000
so make sure you identify a strong ally

150
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,960
with an offense

151
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,280
authentic relationship and you nurture

152
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,080
that relationship

153
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,000
the second tip i'd like to share with

154
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,639
you is to share your goals so

155
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,199
be very vocal speak up share your goals

156
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,039
and ask for promotions

157
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,880
don't wait for permissions to share your

158
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,560
goals be proactive

159
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,120
take the lead and own your career so at

160
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,560
the beginning of my career

161
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,800
um i remember that i never shed my goals

162
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,639
because i thought it would be seen as

163
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,759
too ambitious too aggressive almost and

164
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,919
i found that women at work are either

165
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,000
liked and

166
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,880
not respected and not promoted or not

167
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,600
liked and respected and promoted

168
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,160
which is unfortunate but but i found it

169
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,880
very true

170
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,440
and this is backed up by research uh

171
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,000
research

172
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,919
finds a strong correlation between um

173
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,440
men's like um likability

174
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,560
and success at work whereas for women

175
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,039
there is a strong correlation between

176
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,160
likability and um not being promoted and

177
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,280
vice versa

178
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,120
if they get promoted and respected

179
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,639
they're not like so

180
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,039
um you know i started being more vocal

181
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,319
about my career goals

182
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,039
even if that meant being less liked and

183
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,039
i started seeing some results and being

184
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,400
promoted more so

185
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,880
the main takeaway is to be vocal about

186
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,400
your goals and share your goals

187
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,120
the third tip i'd like to share with you

188
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,199
to boost your career is to ask for

189
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:47,759
glamour

190
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,319
work so you know by asking so what is

191
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,199
glamour work

192
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,240
glamour work is any high profile type of

193
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,199
work you know when

194
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,919
it's sponsored by a senior executive or

195
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,160
you're joining a task force to identify

196
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,400
a new revenue stream or giving a keynote

197
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,000
for example

198
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
research shows that women often end up

199
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,400
doing office house work while men get

200
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,960
all the glamour work so and glamour

201
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,919
works

202
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,639
glamour work really opens doors so when

203
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,720
i started asking for glamour work

204
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,759
um to you know my my sponsor that's when

205
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,080
i started getting more offers such as

206
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,840
speaking engagement on behalf of my

207
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,280
company for example or

208
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,080
joining a company task force to identify

209
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,560
newer

210
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,360
revenue stream so this is very important

211
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,240
that you

212
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,479
push back on office house work and you

213
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,520
ask and you demand

214
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,520
glamour work in your organization

215
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,280
um asking for wholehearted recommended

216
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,240
recommendations

217
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,240
is a very important way to boost your

218
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,319
career in deck

219
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,800
recommendations can impact your career

220
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,919
trajectory

221
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,080
dramatically and asking for

222
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,000
recommendations that show complete

223
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,039
confidence

224
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,960
will really help you boost your career

225
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,400
in in tech

226
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,000
so researchers found that

227
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,680
recommendations letters

228
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,160
about women that included more doubt

229
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,960
include

230
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,080
induced phrases and that even had you

231
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,639
know even

232
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,759
one doubt in this phrase could um hinder

233
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,919
your chance of getting the job

234
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,879
so when you ask for recommendations make

235
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:19,280
sure

236
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,720
that they focus on positive

237
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,160
accomplishments and also they are

238
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,599
wholehearted they are completely

239
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:24,800
enthusiastic

240
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,560
if you receive a recommendation that's

241
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,840
sort of half

242
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,919
enthusiastic i would really recommend

243
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:30,879
that you push back

244
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,159
and you ask for a whole hearted

245
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,880
recommendation

246
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,440
building your inclusive network is

247
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,360
another sure way to

248
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,880
boost your career in tech most people

249
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,680
have largely homogeneous homogeneous

250
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,080
work

251
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,360
network 75 of white people

252
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,000
have entirely white social networks

253
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,360
homogeneous networks

254
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,440
form because of the way we network we

255
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,720
produce networks that are just like us

256
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,279
otherwise known as convenience networks

257
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,360
we share the same hobbies and interests

258
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,560
and backgrounds

259
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,080
i'm so by building a diverse network

260
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,839
even though that you know can be

261
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,200
difficult

262
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
it will open open up doors and

263
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,240
opportunities

264
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,519
you know so by um

265
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,680
you know meeting people who are not like

266
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,720
you you know

267
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,240
by meeting people with a different

268
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,240
gender with a different race different

269
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,760
sexual orientation different different

270
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,279
background will open up

271
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,440
um you know your mind your perspective

272
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,880
but also open doors

273
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,000
and will expand opportunities um

274
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,160
for your for your career as well

275
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,279
um the another tip i'd like to share to

276
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,279
boost your career in technology is to

277
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,320
say no to

278
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,680
meeting housework so meeting housework

279
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,000
um you know meetings generate office

280
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,880
house work

281
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,880
taking notes scheduling follow-up

282
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,640
meetings you know clearing coffee cups

283
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,760
etc

284
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,000
women tend to absorb these tasks either

285
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,800
because they are

286
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
asked to or because they simply get the

287
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,079
job done

288
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,360
now you can avoid this pattern by asking

289
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,079
that your company or your team create

290
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,440
office housework

291
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,360
rotating responsibilities for your

292
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,640
regular meetings

293
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,640
so by setting up a schedule for taking

294
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,800
notes for clearing the table

295
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,440
and so forth you're gonna ensure that uh

296
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:23,920
the

297
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,480
meeting housework doesn't fall just on

298
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,480
your shoulders

299
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,680
um on the topic of meetings um you know

300
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,480
be mindful

301
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,920
of meetings misdirected questions so

302
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,680
misdirected questions are questions

303
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,680
being asked to the man in the room

304
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,680
rather than the expert woman

305
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,880
in a 2017 elephant in the valley

306
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,920
survey more than 200 women working in

307
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,920
tech positions were polled

308
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,760
of women with at least 10 years

309
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,200
experience in tech

310
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,000
84 said they had seen a question

311
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,760
directed to a male colleague

312
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
when they themselves were the most

313
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,880
qualified person

314
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,120
in the meeting to answer it and it's not

315
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,800
just men who are guilty of this because

316
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,880
society tends to believe that men hold

317
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,000
more power

318
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,160
so what you can do is redirect the

319
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,519
question to um

320
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,920
yourself when you're the most qualified

321
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,240
person in the room

322
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
and be mindful of things like bro

323
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,519
appropriation so

324
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,200
bro appropriation is um the pattern when

325
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,079
um after women's made a point in the

326
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,720
meeting

327
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,000
and it was not really noticed men

328
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,440
make the same point and it's being

329
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,839
noticed more um so it's essentially

330
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,640
appropriation of someone else's

331
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,600
point or idea so something you can do

332
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,440
about that is using the amplification

333
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,240
method

334
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,600
so during the present president obama's

335
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,079
cabinet the women in his team came up

336
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,240
with the idea of amplifying so

337
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,160
whenever a woman would make a point

338
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,839
during a meeting the other women would

339
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:54,399
repeat

340
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,839
the same point to make sure it was

341
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,600
amplified so that's a

342
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,920
simple technique you can use to support

343
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,720
each other

344
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,959
other women in your team and really

345
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,000
prevent

346
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,880
appropriation from happening and finally

347
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,399
off topic questions

348
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,360
are also related to meetings and so

349
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,279
that's any question that's meant

350
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,600
to test you and test your authority so

351
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,320
whenever

352
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,880
for example a man asks you an off-topic

353
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,480
question in a meeting to test your

354
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,519
authority

355
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,920
redirect the question to the agenda of

356
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,519
the meeting to make sure

357
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,120
you don't get tested

358
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,079
and the seventh tip i'd like to share

359
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,240
with you to boost your career in tech

360
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,240
as a woman is to demand effective

361
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,279
feedback

362
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,600
so you know if you wonder why don't we

363
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,680
have more women in leadership in tech

364
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,480
well research researchers at stanford

365
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,160
university pointed out to

366
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,440
one main reason the vague feedback that

367
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,000
women tend to receive over their careers

368
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,399
so by analyzing performance reviews from

369
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,120
three large

370
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,680
tech companies the research uncovered

371
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,480
some big

372
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,720
differences in the feedback given to men

373
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,920
versus women

374
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,000
women were less likely than men to

375
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,839
receive specific feedback

376
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,880
tied to outcomes this was both true for

377
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,839
praise

378
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,639
and for constructive feedback by

379
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:13,680
contrast

380
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,920
men were offered a clearer picture of

381
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,440
what they were doing well

382
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,200
how their performance was impacting the

383
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,360
business and what they needed to do to

384
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,720
get promoted

385
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,959
the study also found other gender

386
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,480
differences in performance reviews

387
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,560
specifically in language

388
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,480
when women were praised they were twice

389
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,600
as likely to receive

390
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,760
feedback on team contribution versus

391
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,519
individual accomplishments

392
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,040
which could hold them back during

393
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,720
performance reviews

394
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,519
women were also described as supportive

395
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,639
collaborative

396
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,839
helpful twice as often as men and they

397
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:46,560
received

398
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,040
76 of the reference of being too

399
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,639
aggressive

400
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,320
men's reviews included words like drive

401
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,519
transform innovate tackle

402
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,040
twice as often as women so let's face it

403
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,560
the language used to describe men

404
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,560
represent highly valued traits in many

405
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,600
industries

406
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,360
the language used to describe women is

407
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,760
subjective and difficult to interpret

408
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,360
so another research shows that

409
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,279
suggestions for improvement for women

410
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,800
focused on personality

411
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,680
emotion and tone those given to men were

412
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,720
more concrete

413
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,360
direct and actionable and these dynamics

414
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,360
can disadvantage women at promotion

415
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,240
times

416
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,839
without specific documented

417
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,680
accomplishment it is hard to promote

418
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,800
someone and i'd like to share one final

419
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,360
research

420
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,040
um on that topic in 2016 mckenzie found

421
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,959
that women are less likely than men to

422
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,800
receive difficult feedback

423
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,399
because people say they don't want to

424
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,240
upset someone especially for male

425
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,480
managers giving feedback to female

426
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,279
employees

427
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,760
so one thing you can do is ask your

428
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,720
employer

429
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,560
to provide training on how to give

430
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,040
feedback and also

431
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,920
make sure to demand feedback that's tied

432
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,279
to business outcome

433
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,240
specific focusing on um objective

434
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,600
measurement and not on emotions or

435
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,880
and is not vague so

436
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,880
we covered a lot of ground today but in

437
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,399
summary what you can do

438
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,480
to boost your career as a womanist tech

439
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,320
is be proactive

440
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,320
be intentional about your network and

441
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,480
your mentors and your sponsors

442
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,360
be vocal speak up even at the risk of

443
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,560
not being liked

444
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,920
because this is the only way by sharing

445
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,199
your goal that you will start seeing

446
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,959
results

447
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,839
share your ambitions push back on any

448
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,160
unenthusiastic recommendations

449
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,720
push back on meeting housework demand

450
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,440
concrete

451
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,560
concrete actionable feedback

452
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,839
so i'd love to show um to share your um

453
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,320
to hear your tips and your top um you

454
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,240
know advice for women to get to the top

455
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,199
in deck so

456
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,600
um you know if you could share on on

457
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,160
linkedin on twitter or facebook

458
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,480
what's your top tip for women to get at

459
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,320
the top in technology i would really

460
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:06,000
like to hear that
