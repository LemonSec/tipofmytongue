1
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,440
oh excellent well

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,839
hello everyone and thanks for joining us

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,000
as we jump on the stage of the

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,480
career village at the virtual version of

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,760
the diana initiative

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,640
2020.

7
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,000
so now is it just me or does it seem as

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,160
though you can't attend any event this

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:30,640
year

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,440
without everyone waxing on about the

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,600
millions of infosec jobs that will go

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,840
unfilled over the next several years due

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,480
to a shortage of skilled candidates

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,040
but the thing is you hear that all the

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,360
time because it's true

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,280

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,280
hershevik group microsoft and many

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:49,760
others

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,920
have published similar results from

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,239
their own independent studies

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,879
it's so prevalent that huge numbers of

22
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:57,360
people

23
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,079
are rushing into the industry even from

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,120
non-i.t

25
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,640
fields and from various backgrounds ages

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,640
levels of experience and geographic

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,240
regions

28
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,280
and as we may know joining a new crowd

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,320
especially one filled with hackers

30
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,119
okay well all joking aside it can truly

31
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:17,520

108
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,840
carlita um

109
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,480
i am at the moment a part-time cso for a

110
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,920
non-profit in atlanta

111
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,120
that serves primarily the um

112
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,840
library museum and archive space i have

113
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,879
for the last

114
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,480
three years run my own consulting

115
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,239
company where i either do

116
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,680
cto cio work for and now c v c so work

117
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,319
for

118
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,200
small orgs or i do knowledge strategy

119
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,000
for security

120
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,439
teams and that means that i make sure

121
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,358
that they learn to collaborate

122
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,279
have a good work culture that sort of

123
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,199
thing so i split my time between

124
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,880
serving security teams and making them

125
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,199
more human or serving human teams

126
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,880
and making them more secure excellent

127
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,800
so now that we know our panelists let's

128
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,199
get to know them actually a little more

129
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,120
so probably the first question which is

130
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,800
a good place to start off today is how

131
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,400
did each of you

132
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,960
start your career in security because as

133
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,000
we know not everyone

134
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,919
starts in that direction but that's

135
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,759
where we all happen to be at the moment

136
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,600
so ping maybe you can take the stage

137
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,280
first oh

138
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,840
i am uh not a technical practitioner and

139
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,160
by no means will i ever say that i've

140
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,680
ever served as a technical consultant

141
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,360
although i've run many teams of people

142
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,880
who are deeply technical

143
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,199
i actually graduated with an art history

144
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,600
degree i worked as a graphic designer

145
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,360
when blackhead and defcon became one of

146
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,280
my customers at the time i was designing

147
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,639
trade show booths and

148
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,160
doing a lot of marketing advertising

149
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,840
work i discovered

150
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,680
that what i was really good at it's

151
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,960
something i'm still very good at

152
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,240
is uh people and processes right and

153
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,400
as def con and black cat grew they

154
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,680
really needed someone to

155
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,000
get them more organized to facilitate

156
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,280
relationships

157
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,280
um and after spending you know quite a

158
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,320
bit of time there

159
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,759
um the same skills that you have in uh

160
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,280
bringing people together translate

161
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,120
across many different industries

162
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,199
i love security it was like the up and

163
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,199
coming right we're on the cutting edge

164
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,880
all the new things all the time

165
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,560
so i was very fortunate enough to go and

166
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,080
work at labs um

167
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,759
and i've been around enough to really

168
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,680
deeply understand security vernacular

169
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,320
and tech

170
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,080
and technology um and so here i am still

171
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,759
working in security it's really

172
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,680
fascinating really exciting

173
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,120
well and that that is fascinating

174
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,800
because in the previous talk

175
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,479
there was a question at the end of the

176
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,639
presentation that asked about well i

177
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,280
don't have

178
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,720
a cyber security or any kind of stem

179
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,800
degree is that going to hurt me in the

180
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,639
future and just time and time again not

181
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,680
only are we hearing

182
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,440
that so many people don't come from that

183
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,199
particular background

184
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,080
but as we had discussed earlier in the

185
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,400
career village this morning carlotta

186
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,759
there are a lot of companies that don't

187
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,919
even require a degree anymore microsoft

188
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:24,479
google

189
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,160
uh several companies that are like that

190
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,400
now so don't let that stop you if

191
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,919
there's something that you want you go

192
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:30,400
for it

193
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,919
so sarah a little bit about your

194
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,520
background sure

195
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,039
um so i am also not in tech

196
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,479
uh i don't have a tech background

197
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,319
because i'm uh as i say

198
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,680
self-proclaimed hr nerd um which is

199
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,600
a position that i think everybody just

200
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,919
accidentally falls into hr is not one of

201
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,759
those things when you're

202
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,720
a little little girl uh growing up back

203
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,400
in pennsylvania i wasn't like i'm gonna

204
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,680
grow up and be

205
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,960
a human resource specialist uh wasn't on

206
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,280
my

207
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,800
was on my list but i started 15 years

208
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,360
ago

209
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,599
as a junior recruiter in the it space

210
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,680
um then in in 2009 we had

211
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,120
the great recession and i lost my job

212
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,360
and i thought i need to get out i wanna

213
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,400
i need to get out of

214
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,199
of it staffing because that's not a

215
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,880
secure place

216
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,319
insecure place but i ended up

217
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,840
back in it um at experience it solutions

218
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,720
and turns out i

219
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,880
ended up being there for for 10 years a

220
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,960
job i was reluctant to take

221
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,160
um which i'll talk about more later um

222
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,880
but i ended up there for uh 10 years

223
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,039
supporting um blue cross blue shield

224
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,720
then i moved on to supporting hewlett

225
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,599
packard

226
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,160
and then microsoft for a little bit uh

227
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,000
before i came to isc

228
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,199
so i made it made a huge circle um

229
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,280
because we're located in baltimore but i

230
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,319
left baltimore

231
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,919
came full circle and now i'm back here

232
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,479
10 years later nice

233
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,520
excellent carlotta you are next uh i am

234
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,960
probably the closest to hands-on

235
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,479
technical

236
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,280
today i tried my hand at being assisted

237
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,240
men back in the

238
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,280
early i did my

239
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,960
studied for the ccna looked at being a

240
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,400
network engineer i

241
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,479
really didn't enjoy those like very

242
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:19,680
capable

243
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,879
i just didn't like it right and i

244
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,160
tried my hand at a little bit of

245
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,479
development and one day some artists i

246
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,919
had a lot of artist friends and they're

247
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:28,639
like

248
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,039
i'd love to have a website but ibm

249
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:31,680
charges

250
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,679
five thousand dollars a page and like it

251
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,039
can't be that hard

252
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,880
so i ended up in web development and

253
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,479
that's how i put myself through school

254
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,799
my undergrad degree is actually in

255
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,760
chemistry

256
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,080
uh and i was a research chemist for uh

257
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,760
cotton incorporated for several

258
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,040
several months um but i found myself

259
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,279
networking all of the lab equipment to

260
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,839
automatically dump data into a database

261
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,040
and i thought

262
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,760
i'm in the wrong business so at that

263
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,920
point i switched and i became a business

264
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,480
analyst

265
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,360
um helping a small team develop

266
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,040
large-scale content management systems

267
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,600
that would

268
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,080
house hundreds of thousands of assets

269
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,320
and from there i kind of grew into

270
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,360
enterprise architecture management and i

271
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,399
i found i had a knack for making support

272
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,480
teams actually communicate i ended up as

273
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,320
a knowledge manager

274
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,279
in a startup many years ago and and that

275
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,200
put me on a knowledge strategy

276
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,600
um road and what knowledge strategy is

277
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,560
and you're gonna hear

278
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,800
this a lot in security it's aligning

279
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,040
people processes and technology

280
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,279
to optimize for business outcomes and

281
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,800
has i tried to figure out where

282
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,279
i could bring my strategy roles uh

283
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,440
strategy experience into security

284
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,880
i realized csos align you know people

285
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,160
processes and technology for security

286
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,920
outcomes and i had already been working

287
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,360
at that point

288
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,560
for several years with a security vendor

289
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,000
and so i launched my own company and

290
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,480
here i am now

291
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,440
awesome okay so let's play out a

292
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,959
scenario if you don't mind

293
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,560
as it just so happens we have

294
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,320
representatives on the panel today from

295
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,959
the three main phases of hiring

296
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,680
so carlotta as a cso or virtual cso

297
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,000
helps determine those big picture needs

298
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,160
and

299
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,440
trying to help those companies get the

300
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,399
ball rolling sarah being the hr nerd

301
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,800
that she is in creating job descriptions

302
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,640
promoting them getting candidates

303
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,839
retaining uh

304
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,680
talent and then of course there's ping

305
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,440
being a senior director and making those

306
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,640
final decisions

307
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,519
for membership on her team so let's go

308
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,560
one by one

309
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,959
and go through the actual hiring process

310
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,079
and get a glimpse

311
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,320
kind of behind the scenes to hopefully

312
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,920
offer some helpful hints

313
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,760
for all of you who are looking to get

314
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,200
into infosec

315
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,839
so let's start with carlotta so carlotta

316
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,360
just your thoughts on

317
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,680
the hiring process on putting together a

318
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,040
security program

319
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,200
what you're looking for when it comes to

320
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,480
not only those outcomes

321
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,240
but the individuals to make those

322
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,079
outcomes happen absolutely

323
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,399
and one of the reasons that i love

324
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,640
conferences like this is that i get to

325
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,320
meet all kinds of people who are coming

326
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,079
from very diverse backgrounds

327
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,000
i tend to look very much for the person

328
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,760
uh i'm i'm serving

329
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,959
like i said my main client has vcso i'm

330
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,279
serving a non-profit

331
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,279
nonprofits don't pay as well but they're

332
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,600
a lot more flexible in terms of

333
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,360
you understand our space and you

334
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,720
understand security so you can

335
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,560
communicate with us so that's a really

336
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,839
great way to to get people into security

337
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:30,720
and it's it's a

338
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,079
it's a lot more generous with the

339
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,920
learning curve as well uh

340
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,000
so i'm very much about looking at the

341
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,519
people and how they're going to fit with

342
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,440
the client and much more about the

343
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,320
the culture the person getting that soft

344
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,920
skills because i know that the

345
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,839
the client is willing to to invest the

346
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,160
time to let that person train

347
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,959
awesome as a quick follow-up um how many

348
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,399
times in your experience either with

349
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,519
your current position or

350
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,160
others have you had to actually create a

351
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,440
brand new department

352
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,519
or just uh expand on a current

353
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,120
department and maybe the different

354
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,480
challenges between the two

355
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,639
oh that's a really good question i tend

356
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,320
to create brand new departments because

357
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,839
that's what i love doing

358
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,839
um previously my schtick is almost more

359
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,160
uh turnaround situations you have

360
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,839
especially in support organizations and

361
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,600
deeply technical companies with deeply

362
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,320
technical

363
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,160
uh uh customers support can go sideways

364
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,040
very quick

365
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,320
and my my stick was to come in and

366
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,760
make it better because a lot of those

367
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,600
situations i could literally do nothing

368
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,360
wrong anything i would do

369
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,160
to improve that situation uh so it's

370
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,760
only recently that i start actually

371
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,880
getting to open the team

372
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,160
myself um and did that answer your

373
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,959
questions on

374
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,959
because i've lost the threat i'm so

375
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,079
tired no

376
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,440
it's totally cool we were just kind of

377
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,279
comparing um or at least the thought

378
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,000
process was

379
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,399
let's compare what would uh make you

380
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,120
determine

381
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,040
whether you're just going to supplement

382
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,560
something that they're already doing or

383
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,000
just say you know what you have nothing

384
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
we need to create it from scratch or

385
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
blow it all up and start from start from

386
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,519
the beginning well and that's i think

387
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,880
it's a question of where they are in

388
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,839
their maturity model

389
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,320
right my current client is a great

390
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,040
example

391
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,959
they've got deeply technical people who

392
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,399
are very passionate about

393
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,000
passionate about serving their

394
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,120
communities and some of those

395
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,120
communities or open source communities

396
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,959
so they're already doing a lot of the

397
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,480
security tasks

398
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,279
correctly they're just not communicating

399
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,279
so for them i'm saying you need one

400
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:23,839
person

401
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,480
that will will act has the glue for

402
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,240
these multiple different

403
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,839
it will be the hub for these different

404
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,760
wheels that are turning and make sure

405
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,480
that

406
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,360
that gives visibility to the execs and

407
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,040
to the board of directors

408
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,199
um for a lot of situations uh

409
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,000
usually you're coming in i would say

410
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,519
even if i'm taking the client from

411
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,680
zero to one i like to say i'm the vc so

412
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,360
that takes you from not knowing anything

413
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,720
about security to actually knowing

414
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,920
something about security

415
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,600
my buddy chris roberts a lot of people

416
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,560
know him he's the the vc so that

417
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,480
security startups hire that is that's

418
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,600
not my space

419
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,959
i'm trying to get that basic first step

420
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,519
they're usually ideally already doing

421
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,720
some of those things

422
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,800
it's very rare when some tech person

423
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,079
hasn't stepped up and said you know

424
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,240
we're doing it wrong

425
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,440
excellent and maybe that's something we

426
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,120
can come back to in a little while is

427
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,320
that when you are

428
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,720
not only getting into a career but then

429
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,079
you're advancing in that

430
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,920
you actually have a lot of choices as to

431
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,279
where you go are you going to work for a

432
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,720
company are you going to be independent

433
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,079
and if you are independent

434
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,399
what types of clients do you actually

435
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,600
prefer to work with

436
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,040
so but that being said so sarah

437
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,880
somebody like carlotta will come into a

438
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,399
company and say hey we either need to

439
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,839
start from scratch or we need to start

440
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:38,880
hiring some people

441
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,560
so she'll start talking to managers and

442
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,639
then all of them start talking to you

443
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,680
and say okay go so

444
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,440
how do you do that how do you take their

445
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
desires and turn it into

446
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,440
the proper job descriptions in order to

447
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,920
get them what they need

448
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,600
so i mean obviously first you're going

449
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,680
to start with budgets and find out

450
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,079
where you're at but also like carlotta

451
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:00,800
said you

452
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,440
you need to know the maturity of the

453
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,040
company and where they're at do they

454
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,199
have any senior level people

455
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,680
and you know kind of figure out what

456
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,040
they have and where

457
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,839
people can move around i mean certainly

458
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:14,720
and i don't know if

459
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,480
carlotta would advise this but i would

460
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,560
think if you could take people that

461
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,079
already know the product and they

462
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,600
already know the company and sort of

463
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,880
that culture

464
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,680
you can move somebody over to start that

465
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,000
department i think that's going to

466
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,040
that's going to be key if you don't if

467
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,079
you start them

468
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,560
a brand new outsider into the company i

469
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,160
think that would be really tough

470
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,320
um but once you have somebody that is

471
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,759
senior that knows the vision that knows

472
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,199
the culture and knows all these

473
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,480
these big picture things of where you

474
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,639
want it to go then you kind of decide

475
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,000
especially with budget and especially

476
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,839
with a small growing company

477
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,920
um you have to decide am i going to

478
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,399
spend more money getting someone who

479
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,000
really knows what they're doing or can

480
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,120
i bring in some folks that that can be

481
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,040
trained up and that are hungry

482
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,279
um that's what we do at ise for the most

483
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,399
part

484
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,120
to bring in someone that has this very

485
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,000
wide range

486
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,199
of skills um isn't too

487
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,320
focused on one path um

488
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,519
but you know they can they can grow we

489
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,399
you know maybe an aptitude higher you

490
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,560
know someone who is just really going to

491
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,680
learn and then

492
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,320
we can move them around to where where

493
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,279
they're needed

494
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,040
so i think you know someone who is

495
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,120
flexible not not too rigid

496
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,399
might be the direction you want to go um

497
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,440
and just train people in your culture

498
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,880
your um security uh protocols and sort

499
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,920
of

500
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,240
bring them up the way they that you want

501
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,440
so it depends on what your

502
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,440
what your mission is awesome and a

503
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,959
follow-up for you if you don't mind

504
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,440
so a lot of people are talking today not

505
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,880
only in the career village but in a

506
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,000
bunch of other different

507

um i definitely think you you know you

536
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,080
talk to a hiring manager

537
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,440
and you get what they want and

538
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,520
not all the time and and ping might be

539
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,799
able to speak to this like

540
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,559
they a lot of hiring managers will have

541
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,080
these like really

542
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,720
grand expectations of what they need and

543
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,240
they want somebody with like

544
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,880
10 years of experience with all of these

545
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,120
certs and all this experience

546
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,000
and i want to pay forty thousand dollars

547
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,600
for it

548
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,480
so you've gotta sort of it takes time to

549
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,280
sort of

550
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,760
work with a hiring manager and really

551
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,480
weed out

552
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,440
well really do they really need this do

553
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,200
they really need that and sort of this

554
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,559
back and forth and sometimes

555
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,480
it does take posting a job with all the

556
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,559
the wonderful things that they want that

557
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,160
purple squirrel right

558
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,080
posting that job and just seeing what

559
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,919
comes in and then showing a hiring

560
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,120
manager okay here's

561
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,360
here's what we have available what do

562
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,320
you think can we

563
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,080
can we workshop this a little bit can we

564
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,440
change it um

565
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,919
because this is what it's you know what

566
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:50,640
the return

567
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,160
is um workshopping that reposting that

568
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,160
job position and and seeing what you get

569
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,120
from that

570
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,360
um but i think other ways to do it are

571
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,400
to um

572
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,760
well it's tough when it's brand new if

573
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,200
you've got some people already in a

574
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,919
position

575
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,840
you sit down with them you say what do

576
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,080
you do what are you working on

577
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,039
um because there's a job description and

578
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,080
then there's

579
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,200
what i actually do i

580
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,480
jokingly say that like 80 of your job

581
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,080
falls into the uh other duties as

582
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,159
assigned that's your job

583
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,520
awesome all right so ping

584
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,160
sarah puts the puts it out there she

585
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,360
gets all these applicants

586
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,280
she whittles it all down she sends you a

587
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,320
few of them what are you looking for um

588
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,039
how important is it between culture

589
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,480
technical ability

590
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,840
um you know experience college degree

591
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,000
certificate what is it that really makes

592
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,600
people stand out for you

593
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,880
because you would be the one that would

594
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,840
make the final decision

595
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,280
so great great question because um

596
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,360
so many variables right uh a lot of it

597
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,559
will really depend on what it is that

598
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,600
we're really looking for

599
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,440
i always ask the question what is it

600
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,000
that i need to make the business further

601
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,320
successful right so if it's a technical

602
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,919
role we will rely more heavily on their

603
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,240
technical skills because if they don't

604
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,919
it's very difficult to bring someone up

605
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,000
in the industry and we do take risks i

606
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,320
will

607
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,919
on my team we've taken some risks and

608
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,200
like hired some people who really didn't

609
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,000
have the technical

610
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,600
skill but we knew that there would be a

611
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,440
long ramp so there's a big investment in

612
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,000
those

613
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,039
those candidates that come to you um but

614
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,880
in general right you're probably looking

615
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,000
for someone who's got a couple years

616
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,679
experience at the very minimum

617
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,679
when it when the reality check comes

618
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,200
down to when i have the conversation

619
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,400
with them because i'm not a technical

620
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,120
person right

621
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,559
they'll have gone through the technical

622
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,720
interviews right gone through the hr

623
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,280
filter

624
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,400
and everything like that um i want to

625
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,840
look for the red flags

626
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,159
right for me the red flags would be i

627
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,159
don't i really want a very diverse set

628
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,840
of people on my team because their job

629
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,440
every day is to solve problems it's

630
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,919
solved very complex customer crisis

631
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:56,960
problems right

632
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,880
and i need a lot of cursing in that so i

633
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,720
don't want someone everyone that's come

634
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,360
from

635
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,600
uh one company or has exactly three to

636
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,799
five year experience

637
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,559
i don't care about your college degree

638
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,640
people yeah five ten years ago i have

639
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,640
friends who were like i

640
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,000
really thinking about going back to

641
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,120
school to get a college degree i'm like

642
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,080
why you're

643
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,400
you're doing great right like very

644
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,840
interesting work and

645
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,000
and well i'm being held back i think

646
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,520
that's kind of gone by the wayside

647
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,960
because their experience and i always

648
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,559
told them in a couple more years your

649
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,159
experience will trump any college degree

650
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,600
you have because guess what

651
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,000
who asks what your college degree is in

652
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,120
unless uh you're

653
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,799
new out of school and who asks what your

654
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,120
gpa is no one does

655
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,240
right so the first thing i do is i look

656
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,679
for the red flags the red flags would

657
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,919
mean to me would be someone who i

658
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,120
i generally want to get to know the

659
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,799
person right i want to get them relaxed

660
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:45,280
and just

661
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,960
talk i want to know the things that

662
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,799
they're interested in i want to

663
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,159
number one look for something that

664
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,640
they're motivated in a lot of people

665
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,559
will think that the motivation has to be

666
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,120
grand like i want to do charitable work

667
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,919
right something very altruistic or that

668
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:00,559
um

669
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,320
it has to be you know something specific

670
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,600
to like for instance since i've worked

671
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,400
for microsoft

672
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,480
i've always wanted to work at microsoft

673
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,159
i've always you know been a microsoft

674
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,320
fanboy and i want to work there

675
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,080
that's not real motivation i just want

676
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,600
to find something that they're very

677
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,840
dedicated to like if they have a hobby

678
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,240
that they love and they invest in

679
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,760
and they spend a lot of time with where

680
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,200
even if it's their family or their pet

681
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,080
or whatever

682
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,080
that's showing that there's they can

683
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,200
focus on something

684
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,280
right they have something in them that

685
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,679
you can leverage

686
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,799
to get them to do more work right that

687
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,440
you can

688
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,600
talk to them about and that they can

689
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,440
relate to because believe me there's a

690
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,799
lot of people that

691
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,880
take any job that aren't motivated

692
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,400
another thing is when they talk about

693
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,440
themselves

694
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,280
do they only bring up all of the

695
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,480
negative things

696
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,760
i'm gonna keep our manager

697
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,760
a great friend of mine and he always

698
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,679
advised me he was like no matter what we

699
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:54,000
do

700
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,080
as hr people and hiring managers the one

701
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,159
thing you can never account for

702
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,720
is all the baggage from their childhood

703
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,240
that shows up in their work

704
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,240
carefully too what are they talking

705
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,760
about in their negatives and their

706
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,880
positives

707
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,360
um and someone who only focuses on the

708
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,360
positive is also red flag because

709
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,200
that may be someone who's not because

710
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,039
there's a reality check right like

711
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,559
it's great exciting to do instant

712
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,320
response work but i'm like the reality

713
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,200
is

714
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,280
they are long days with a customer

715
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,559
freaking out because they're

716
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,640
losing millions of dollars and stop you

717
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,400
know work stoppages or can't get to

718
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,760
their data

719
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,840
are you going to be able to bear up to

720
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,159
that burden right like and i

721
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,559
i i want to find some reality in the

722
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,440
person some

723
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,000
some genuineness that comes out when

724
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,679
you're just talking with them

725
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,760
um there have been times on some of the

726
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,120
teams i've worked with when they talk to

727
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,240
the candidate they're like

728
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,240
yeah we're gonna let you talk to him but

729
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,600
he's not our first choice i'm like well

730
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,240
why

731
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,880
they're like don't like him i'm like

732
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,600
because they didn't spend any time

733
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,279
to know the person right and they're

734
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,279
like they did so bad on the

735
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,000
on the uh technical interview and i'm

736
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,039
like

737
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,200
technically they're on the panel and

738
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,960
they gotta like prove themselves i would

739
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,960
be nervous

740
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,679
i'm not a good test paper a great

741
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,559
student but a terrible test paper

742
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,760
uh the things i look for are

743
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,000
some genuine personality coming out when

744
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,960
we talk

745
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,960
something that they're motivated by and

746
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,320
i don't care if it's money

747
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,960
i don't care if i've had someone who on

748
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,080
my team said

749
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:33,840
uh in three years i'm gonna be you yeah

750
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,840
and i'm like okay well um that's

751
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,640
adorable

752
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,880
that is adorable and i'm not saying you

753
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,760
can't not

754
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,520
because if he were to be his own startup

755
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,760
he can be the ceo or

756
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,039
the next soccer right but he's motivated

757
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,640
clearly there's something that he's

758
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,080
gonna be driven by

759
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,520
and i'm not gonna say that's the carrot

760
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,679
or the apple but that's something i can

761
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,840
try to help get him towards right he's

762
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,440
got a goal he's working for

763
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,120
so he's going to work hard on my because

764
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,559
he believes this doesn't have to get

765
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,760
there

766
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,320
um so that's that's like what i do what

767
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,400
i typically do i talk to people

768
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,559
i try to get to know them i try to

769
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,919
figure out what it is that makes them

770
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:12,880
tick

771
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,480
why it is they really want to be here

772
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,400
some people very clearly as you start

773
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,600
talking with them

774
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,240
you dig in they just want to use your

775
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,919
team as a leverage to get to another

776
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,679
team within the company

777
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,200
there's nothing wrong with that but

778
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,200
because my team invests so heavily

779
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,039
in um curating and shepherding and

780
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,000
nurturing

781
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,440
consultants who are really good at their

782
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,600
role it's tough for me to hire those

783
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,279
people because i'm going to lose them

784
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,039
i know eventually everyone i'm not going

785
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,400
to lose everybody right because there's

786
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,279
some opportunity

787
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,679
underway or life change i'm okay with

788
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:44,559
that and i'm

789
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,279
totally if someone on my team today said

790
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,120
i really want to go to this other group

791
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,640
i love the work working for you but i

792
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,000
really want to do this for the group i

793
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,400
will

794
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,919
do everything in my power to help them

795
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,440
get there because

796
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,320
that karma that comes back right um

797
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,840
probably they'll refer people to help me

798
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,799
out too but

799
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,480
uh it's important that my people be

800
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,559
happy right happy workforce

801
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,000
happy customers so those are things that

802
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,799
i look for really it's the red flags uh

803
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,000
red flags being

804
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,600
um uh i want them to be genuine i want

805
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,799
them to be motivated

806
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,279
um someone who constantly brings up all

807
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,640
the past injuries

808
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,880
is going to be tough for any employer

809
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,000
manager to handle

810
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,520
um and i'm not gonna say they're

811
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,919
absolute no we just know

812
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,000
really what we're buying right like this

813
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,360
person need to

814
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,520
make sure that this culture can support

815
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,039
that

816
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,400
excellent carlotta what do you see as

817
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,919
some red flags and then maybe so we

818
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,600
don't focus totally on the negative

819
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,200
what are some positive ways to either

820
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,360
overcome those red flags or

821
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,960
ways that people really stand out to you

822
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,880
to say hey i want this person

823
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,760
on my team i think a big red flag for me

824
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,760
is it's not just negativity i mean their

825
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,240
their negativity can be a red flag

826
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,720
but sometimes you confuse realism with

827
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,919
negativity so

828
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,400
i try to look a little bit past that uh

829
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,120
i think for me

830
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,559
a big red flag though is

831
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,039
i'm trying to to figure out how to say

832
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:11,840
this

833
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,880
um this

834
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,919
kind of resigned attitude right like

835
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,799
i i need a job i'm good at this or i'm

836
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:21,919
good enough at this

837
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,159
right you're not selling yourself when

838
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,279
you're like that

839
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:29,360
uh there are

840
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,919
there are a lot of folks out there who

841
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:32,799
also kind of

842
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,279
they want that 4.0 like they're driven

843
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,240
in the wrong way

844
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,600
like i want that for i'm going to go

845
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,360
back to school and get 4.0 i'm going to

846
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,399
get this job

847
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,880
and i'm going to i'm going to do 90 you

848
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,159
know close rate on your

849
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,399
your triage stuff and it's like that's

850
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,000
i'm not looking for you to achieve a

851
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,480
goal i'm looking for how you think

852
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,640
in terms of a system right if you're

853
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,919
hyper focused if you're

854
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,440
really good at penetration testing

855
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,000
that's great but if you can't tell me

856
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,520
why that's valuable

857
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,600
for an entire system or for an entire

858
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,080
company and why we should sell that

859
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,120
then you're you're too focused your your

860
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,960
focus is way too narrow

861
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,840
um i want your scope and not everyone

862
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,480
can

863
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,520
is a systems thinker or holistic thinker

864
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,760
but even if you're not i want you to be

865
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,720
able to articulate

866
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,120
this is my focus i will look to you for

867
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,159
this piece

868
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,240
right um what i don't want is someone

869
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,840
who's so focused on penetration

870
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,240
testing or on you know something else

871
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:28,880
that

872
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,320
they are like the rest of the

873
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,760
apartment's crap anything else in

874
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,279
security is crap like those those are

875
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,720
not people i want those are not team

876
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,760
players

877
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,480
yeah yeah gotcha all right so so let's

878
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,360
get to the

879
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,360
crux of the situation because so many

880
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,960
people are working

881
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,640
really hard to study and get the

882
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,640
education and whether that's through a

883
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,399
university or self-study

884
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,559
getting certifications they they're

885
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,880
trying to tick those boxes

886
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,360
in order to get past the hr filter so

887
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,640
sarah

888
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,679
how do we do that because now a lot of

889
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:00,880
the systems that are in place and

890
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,000
correct me if i'm wrong

891
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,919
um are all automated so they're looking

892
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,840
for specific keywords or you have to

893
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,399
actually

894
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,120
tick those boxes or your resume doesn't

895
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,399
get through

896
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,640
how do we make sure that we do that and

897
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,720
then in addition to that

898
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,799
um yeah sorry about the echo i'm hearing

899
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,320
it a little bit too

900
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,520
it's probably because we're all on at

901
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,520
the same time i'm seeing that in the

902
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,000
chat

903
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,799
but um also maybe sarah you can give us

904
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,880
some little hints on how we can avoid

905
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,799
the hr filter and maybe make some kind

906
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,640
of direct connection with a company or a

907
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,399
person

908
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,399
so you're you're talking about the

909
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,000
applicant tracking system

910
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,760
the the ats or as i lovingly refer to it

911
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,399
as

912
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,760
the black hole yes ma'am

913
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,279
so um i know everybody here

914
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,480
has heard this and said this

915
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,679
a thousand times so here it is for the

916
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:55,919
101st

917
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,600
time uh network and get referred

918
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,760
is is the way to go instead of that ats

919
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,720
a resume or an introduction coming from

920
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,360
a current

921
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,200
employee or someone like carlotta are

922
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,640
paying means

923
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,000
so much more uh to a recruiter

924
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,320
and they're basically obligated to

925
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,440
actually open and

926
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,679
read that resume right they can't say no

927
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,279
because their colleague sent it to him

928
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,720
so they have to do it

929
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,799
so obviously that's that's the way to

930
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,320
get by that filter but

931
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,320
inevitably you're going to have to

932
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,039
submit your resume to the black hole

933
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,600
um so a couple of things that you can do

934
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,399
to at least

935
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,159
ease some of the pain that goes along

936
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:37,840
with that is one

937
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,720
make sure that your resume is word uh

938
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,039
word formatter or pdf searchable

939
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,080
um recruiter and then just also make

940
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,279
sure that that is like

941
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,000
100 generic um they were already talking

942
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,760
about it in the career village channel

943
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,640
today

944
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,480
you're going to hear more people talk

945
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,640
talk about resumes and how to format

946
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,159
them

947
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,039
i know it seems so boring to do that

948
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:01,600
plain

949
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,200
jane standard thing but recruiters will

950
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:05,840
look at

951
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,799
hundreds of resumes per job sometimes

952
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:09,360
they look

953
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,840
fast so if the information they're

954
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,559
looking for

955
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,960
isn't in those standard spots they

956
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,720
typically look for it

957
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,080
they move on they go fast um so i know

958
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,840
it seems counter-intuitive you want to

959
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,760
do a resume that stands out and it's

960
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,799
flashy so it gets noticed

961
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,799
but it's actually going to get noticed

962
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,320
in a bad way so

963
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,559
look for those those standard resumes

964
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,960
make it that standard format

965
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,159
the other thing that's going to be super

966
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,000
helpful in that is that

967
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,880
when you upload a standard format resume

968
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,559
and you hit submit

969
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,519
what happens next it's going to ask you

970
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,679
to fill out a billion fillable forms

971
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,480
that is exactly what is your resume

972
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,440
right you're going can i just type c

973
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,679
resume in every one of these see resume

974
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,039
see resume see your resume

975
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,840
yeah can't but if uh for the most part

976
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,799
the ats

977
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:04,000
will parse your resume so if your resume

978
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,480
is in that standard boring format

979
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,320
it's going to parse that really well

980
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,919
it's going to save you a lot of time

981
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,200
it's not going to put

982
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,279
you know your college address as your

983
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,279
home address it's not going to put

984
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,120
your college dates as the last job you

985
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,880
worked et cetera so it just

986
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,159
saves you a little bit of time it's

987
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,440
going to populate that stuff a little

988
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,880
bit better and

989
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,559
you know that's kind it's kind of a

990
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,320
numbers game in ats right

991
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,640
it's submitting to as many as you can um

992
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,480
but the other thing that i would

993
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,480
definitely recommend with an ats

994
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,840
is um you really have to customize your

995
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,159
resume for the job you're looking for

996
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,960
there are so many different types of

997
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,960
jobs within security

998
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,840
um and you are probably open to many

999
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,320
different

1000
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,960
avenues but if you don't customize that

1001
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,720
resume for the job that you're looking

1002
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,760
for

1003
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,000
you're gonna run into some roadblocks

1004
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,960
especially

1005
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,640
especially if you're new if you've just

1006
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,320
graduated college you're new to the job

1007
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,200
market

1008
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,799
um that that objective box

1009
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,960
it's the very first thing um that

1010
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,039
recruiters look at right

1011
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:12,159
and if that box if that first thing your

1012
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,519
objective

1013
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,559
doesn't match my job the one you applied

1014
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,840
for

1015
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,760
i'm it's that's the first thing that

1016
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,279
you're already starting off kind of on

1017
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,120
the wrong foot because i think

1018
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,840
well they've applied to my job but their

1019
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,080
their ambitions are really over here

1020
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,600
so we're not really going to be aligned

1021
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,640
so customize even if that's just to have

1022
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,640
four or five base resumes that you save

1023
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,200
for all the different avenues

1024
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,000
save them so that you can kind of cater

1025
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,360
to the job

1026
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,559
and then also you know pull up the job

1027
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,320
description for the position you want

1028
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:48,720
over

1029
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,880
on one screen pull up your resume on the

1030
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,000
other and go through

1031
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,320
that job description if you say to

1032
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,120
yourself and i

1033
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,120
people do this all the time they go

1034
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,480
through that job description and they go

1035
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,679
oh i can do that

1036
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,519
yeah i have that skill oh yeah i can

1037
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,960
code i could read that code

1038
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,240
and they go through the job description

1039
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,480
saying yep yep yep yep yep

1040
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,119
but it's not on their resume right and

1041
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,719
as you said done

1042
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,440
it does keyword matching right the more

1043
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,719
matches you have

1044
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,040
the higher up the list it will feed your

1045
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,480
resume to the recruiter

1046
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,079
so add those things in um just add them

1047
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:22,719
in you know

1048
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,440
uh because you oh you hate being in that

1049
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,399
interview

1050
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:30,000
and the the interviewer says do you have

1051
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,040
xyz

1052
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,280
and they and you say oh yeah yeah i did

1053
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,079
that three years

1054
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,879
ago um for about six months and they go

1055
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,040
well it's not on your resume

1056
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,359
uh that's just the worst so look at that

1057
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,199
job description and make sure that stuff

1058
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,159
is in your resume

1059
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,480
um you know having that technical skills

1060
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,280
chart is

1061
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,159
fantastic populate it with all the

1062
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,520
things that you're skilled in

1063
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,839
and don't put stuff in there that you

1064
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,119
studied and did once

1065
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,280
for a week because you're not an expert

1066
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,880
not take that off

1067
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,200
excellent thank you um well overall we

1068
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,480
kind of know

1069
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,000
and there's that echo again but we kind

1070
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,359
of know that a job

1071
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,520
is one of your your big life decisions

1072
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,640
that you're making

1073
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,200
and so a lot of times we want to always

1074
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,880
remind people that it's not just that

1075
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,880
you're going for a job

1076
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,240
but this is somebody that you're going

1077
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,920
to have to be connected to for a very

1078
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,119
long time

1079
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,200
and with that you want to make sure that

1080
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,800
not only are you the right candidate for

1081
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,680
the job

1082
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,280
but is the person that you're going with

1083
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,480
or the company that you're trying to

1084
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,079
apply to

1085
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,960
are they right for you so ping what are

1086
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,359
your feelings about candidates asking

1087
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,560
you questions during an interview

1088
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,560
it's absolutely crucial i don't want to

1089
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,480
have a one way and i know that

1090
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,720
a lot of people have said that i am um a

1091
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,240
very daunting person to speak to

1092
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,520
right because they're like either heard

1093
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,359
i had some reputation that black hat is

1094
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:50,320
being

1095
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,839
very strict nicely or whatever rumors

1096
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,680
right or they read about your cv

1097
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,520
or they saw you present and they kind of

1098
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,440
have deer in the headlights when they

1099
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,480
talk to you

1100
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,599
it's really important that they come

1101
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,520
with questions because you're right if

1102
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,920
a person is vested in or really

1103
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,640
interested in

1104
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,440
coming to your group um learning more

1105
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,040
about it they're going to have questions

1106
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,760
and that's

1107
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,760
one of the parts of the conversation i

1108
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,520
totally get some people are very nervous

1109
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,880
i've had people that just talked at me

1110
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,359
one guy talked at me for three hours

1111
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:20,960
i let it go for that long because he

1112
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,800
came as a referral from someone else on

1113
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,839
my team

1114
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:26,880
and i sense right he wasn't trying to

1115
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,079
impress me

1116
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,599
he was just wanted to sell himself so

1117
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:32,560
badly

1118
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,560
and i and i had the time and and i

1119
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,079
learned a lot about him and at first i

1120
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,160
was like look i

1121
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,320
my my recommendation was like he was

1122
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,599
very nervous with me

1123
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,680
but he passed the technical interview

1124
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,680
fine the other three because i have

1125
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,320
three hiring

1126
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,760
four managers and three of them have to

1127
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,760
talk to whoever we're hiring

1128
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,800
you all like him i think he'll be fine

1129
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,880
it but he had a lot of questions for me

1130
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,480
too like where

1131
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,720
questions that they that any candidate

1132
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,480
can ask their generic is

1133
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,280
where what are your goals in the next

1134
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,440
year for your team that you're building

1135
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,440
right what are the things that you're

1136
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,160
going to be asking me to work on

1137
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,240
talk about your career as well ask them

1138
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,160
what are what are your

1139
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,960
prospects for advancing in a company

1140
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,160
smaller companies

1141
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,400
um it can be exciting because you can do

1142
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,640
many different roles but other people

1143
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,839
may want something that's more

1144
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,200
structured where

1145
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,040
you know if you want to become a vp

1146
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,400
you're going to need to go to a much

1147
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,160
larger company that can support you

1148
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,560
moving and growing and learning those

1149
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,280
skills

1150
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,760
i had a girlfriend five years industry

1151
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,800
experience

1152
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,400
great person she's been interning with

1153
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,320
us at black hat she was like hey i'm

1154
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:40,880
thinking

1155
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,880
i really want to see the role and i'm

1156
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,160
thinking to myself

1157
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,000
you don't have the experience to be

1158
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
making the decisions as i say

1159
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,760
for any company unless it's your own

1160
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,000
company at this point

1161
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,480
and i was like i don't know but i didn't

1162
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,280
say that to her

1163
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,720
it wasn't a lack of confidence what i

1164
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,400
did say to her was

1165
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,640
i want you to think about this you as a

1166
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,200
27 year old sister

1167
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,720
where does that lead you to go to your

1168
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,640
next company because if you try to get

1169
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,480
hired at a place like microsoft or

1170
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,920
amazon

1171
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,440
that as soon as you see it on your

1172
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,200
resume someone with very little

1173
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:13,920
experience

1174
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,680
trying to get to this level they're like

1175
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,920
i would not hire you because you don't

1176
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,640
have

1177
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,680
the bodied experience to manage as a

1178
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,480
ciso

1179
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,040
at a company this large so you have to

1180
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,800
be patient not be tied so tied to the

1181
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,599
title

1182
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,440
um but it's really important that you do

1183
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,040
come with questions because you have to

1184
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:31,760
express an

1185
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,359
active interest in the place that you're

1186
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,599
going and that oftentimes

1187
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,960
does um delineate you from other

1188
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,480
candidates a lot of cancer just ask

1189
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,920
general questions how am i going to be

1190
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,640
paid

1191
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,880
when are my vacation days you know kind

1192
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,680
of uh

1193
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,839
more generic questions ask questions

1194
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,200
that show that you've

1195
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,200
researched the group or the company that

1196
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,800
you're going you're interviewing at that

1197
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,040
shows you're invested

1198
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,200
i i agree and i just want to add on like

1199
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,200
even you know i feel like

1200
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,599
that's probably one of the biggest

1201
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,040
negative feedback

1202
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,880
pieces that i get from hiring managers

1203
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,800
when they come back and i do that recap

1204
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,880
after they've just interviewed someone

1205
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,720
they just say oh yeah she didn't ask me

1206
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,920
any questions

1207
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,480
right and and i get it because you might

1208
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,920
if by the time you're talking to the

1209
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,760
decision maker you've probably

1210
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,280
talked to the recruiter maybe another

1211
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,040
team member

1212
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,640
technical you know this might be the

1213
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,800
fourth person you talk to

1214
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,480
even if you've actually had all of the

1215
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,480
questions you planned out in advance

1216
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,520
answered ask them again right um

1217
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,280
you know different people in the

1218
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,119
organization are going to answer those

1219
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,400
questions differently so

1220
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,920
it's actually good to get that different

1221
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,760
perspective yeah but yeah

1222
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,440
definitely ask them if they answered

1223
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,119
every think of more there's

1224
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,040
gonna be something or just ask the same

1225
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,040
question again and there there are some

1226
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,240
questions that i have

1227
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,200
just kind of um that i always ask yeah

1228
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,000
throughout my career

1229
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,839
i've asked and what i look for from the

1230
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,599
answer changes depending on where i am

1231
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:00,400
in my career

1232
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,760
when i'm much younger when i was much

1233
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,440
younger in my career my

1234
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,920
i started asking you know what can you

1235
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,280
define success

1236
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,200
in the first 90 days of this role what

1237
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,200
what's a success look like for you

1238
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,760
and if when i was very junior i was

1239
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,680
expecting them to have an idea of

1240
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,000
success in their head right but now that

1241
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,680
i'm very senior if i ask that question

1242
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,280
and they have a very specific idea

1243
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,640
they're looking for someone more junior

1244
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,359
than me right so the right answer at

1245
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,839
this stage in my career is you know i'm

1246
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,440
hiring somebody who's smart and good at

1247
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,200
this i want them to come in and set that

1248
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,880
measure

1249
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,800
the other thing is whether you're

1250
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,040
talking to a manager or talking to a

1251
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,000
peer or potential

1252
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,480
peer or potential internal customer a

1253
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,240
really great question is

1254
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,280
uh how do you see working with this role

1255
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,000
what does this role make easier for you

1256
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,640
right

1257
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,319
and that's a really great question

1258
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,000
because if they don't have an answer for

1259
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,359
it they don't know what you're supposed

1260
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:54,800
to be doing and that's going to be a

1261
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,160
very hard job

1262
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,040
to walk into right if you if you have a

1263
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,640
couple of people are like oh yeah

1264
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,400
i need you to do i i need to work with

1265
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,920
this world this way that's great

1266
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,640
um but if pretty much everyone's like we

1267
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,240
need a project manager

1268
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,280
i don't know you know then you you have

1269
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,400
to decide whether

1270
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,280
you have the spine to go in there and

1271
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:15,920
set it

1272
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,079
right um and some people do and some

1273
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,760
people don't i am somebody if you give

1274
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,480
me

1275
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,200
an inch and make it kind of vague i am

1276
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,480
going to make it my way

1277
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,480
right and i'm going to be really happy

1278
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,520
with that um

1279
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,720
but there are a lot of people out there

1280
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,400
who want a little more structure who

1281
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:30,800
want

1282
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,839
a little more certainty rolling in right

1283
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:34,400
so that's

1284
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,839
that's the kind of questions that i

1285
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,079
would ask well speaking of questions

1286
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,920
i know it's important to ask questions

1287
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,920
when you're in the interview

1288
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,520
but probably even more important as

1289
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,680
asking yourself the difficult questions

1290
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,160
so if you guys each had one question

1291
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,839
that you think a candidate should ask

1292
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,920
themselves and be prepared for

1293
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,920
what would it be because i know one of

1294
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,200
them that i think of right off the bat

1295
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:55,440
is

1296
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,119
you know either where do you see

1297
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,640
yourself in five years or what kind of

1298
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,720
value can you bring to the company

1299
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,040
and people go uh wow you know i never

1300
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,079
even thought about that

1301
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,359
so what are some things that they should

1302
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,599
actually think of to ask themselves

1303
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,480
before they even show up and anybody can

1304
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,960
take that one

1305
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,400
so i don't know if this is exactly the

1306
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,000
the question

1307
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,040
don but one question that you're almost

1308
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,200
always gonna get when you go into a

1309
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,280
company is

1310
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,280
tell me about your flaws or your

1311
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,720
shortcomings or tell me where you're

1312
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,000
weak and i think

1313
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,359
while i don't know if that's the most

1314
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:34,400
important question it always gets asked

1315
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,880
and people say i work too hard

1316
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,079
i dedicate too much

1317
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,359
and exactly my first job i definitely

1318
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:46,560
did that right like

1319
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,839
you're gonna ask me that's our

1320
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:49,599
behavioral question they're gonna ask me

1321
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:50,720
what my weaknesses are

1322
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,880
and i'm gonna take a really good thing

1323
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,480
and i make it sound bad like

1324
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,680
i'm too organized uh i spent too much

1325
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,000
time

1326
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
organizing and that that can be a waste

1327
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,920
of time yeah

1328
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,119
guilty um but that

1329
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,480
realistically it should be something

1330
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,640
like i'm too soft when my kids want

1331
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,160
something

1332
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,119
but i really do think even though that

1333
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:15,680
doesn't sound like a big deal question

1334
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,400
it's like ping said you look for people

1335
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:18,960
to be

1336
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,760
genuine and when you do something like

1337
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,480
that

1338
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,280
it is they see right through it they see

1339
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,880
exactly what you're doing

1340
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,319
and again like what ping said

1341
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:33,200
you we look for people that have drive

1342
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,880
and ambition

1343
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,160
and when you can say i don't know how to

1344
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:38,839
do

1345
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:42,319
xyz very well but i'm willing to

1346
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:46,160
learn it right that is what is

1347
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,240
super important right we look for

1348
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,880
candidates that have that drive

1349
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,920
um and sort of are a forever student

1350
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,240
right

1351
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,720
ambition and and the desire to learn go

1352
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,520
hand in hand

1353
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,599
so regardless of what level you are at

1354
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,119
you need to be wanting to get to that

1355
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:05,680
next

1356
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,400
level willing to grow no matter how much

1357
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,079
experience you have

1358
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,680
you should know that you don't know

1359
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,599
everything especially in i.t

1360
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,760
right yeah lifelong learning is crucial

1361
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,400
in i.t and even more so in infosec

1362
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,680
yes yes so even if you have 10 years

1363
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,720
under your belt

1364
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,960
you should also be willing to say i can

1365
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,319
learn from an intern

1366
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:29,359
you know and so i think that that is

1367
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:30,800
really important so when you get that

1368
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,480
question everybody's going to ask you

1369
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,520
that question

1370
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,720
so know how to answer it genuinely yeah

1371
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,560
a little bit of self-awareness goes

1372
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,359
really far right there yeah awesome well

1373
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:41,680
let's

1374
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,359
uh let's go on to this one real quick if

1375
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:44,480
you guys don't mind because i'm looking

1376
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,359
at the time

1377
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:48,480
so i want to just go to maybe one or two

1378
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,680
pieces of advice

1379
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,880
that you would want to give somebody

1380
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,400
that maybe we haven't even touched on

1381
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:52,960
today

1382
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,920
so carlotta you want to go first oh boy

1383
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,160
uh

1384
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,920
recently even harken back to something

1385
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,280
maybe we talked about during the career

1386
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,240
village well

1387
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,079
yeah i mean a part of it is that just

1388
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,520
research know what you want

1389
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,200
and and that's the problem is that is

1390
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,640
that there's so much out there and when

1391
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,400
you're looking for your first job

1392
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,800
you want to take any job right but if

1393
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,440
you can articulate what you want my job

1394
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,119
then i'm i'm more likely to listen to

1395
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,119
you and maybe it's i want to work for

1396
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:22,400
the support org of this

1397
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,560
uh security vendor because i want to

1398
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,160
understand what other roles there are

1399
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,040
and i want to grow

1400
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,119
into another role in three to five years

1401
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:30,720
like that's gonna get a much better

1402
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,079
response for me

1403
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,880
than somebody who doesn't know what they

1404
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,440
want to do

1405
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,800
i want to do it because i want to be in

1406
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,800
security is not the best answer

1407
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,720
excellent ping um

1408
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,079
i would always say be very honest

1409
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,280
100 when being asked a question

1410
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,040
do not pat it there's a difference

1411
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,800
between confidence and confidence

1412
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,440
um and the one thing i was cautious be

1413
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,280
honest because if you are not honest and

1414
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,400
it gets found out

1415
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,079
after you get hired or as a part of the

1416
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:03,440
hiring process

1417
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,640
that is a nope it's you're breaking the

1418
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,319
trust immediately

1419
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:10,560
um and if they find out a little you

1420
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,480
know don't lie and say you have 10 years

1421
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,720
python coding when you have 10 months

1422
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,240
or 10 hours because you i mean people

1423
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:18,640
say

1424
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,079
do whatever it takes to get your foot in

1425
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,760
the door but if you

1426
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,040
if it's a lie that's going to be

1427
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,839
discovered right away

1428
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:27,359
it's going to really hurt you because

1429
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:28,960
they will not be able to recommend i

1430
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,079
would not be able to recommend this

1431
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,000
person for another role

1432
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,400
i wouldn't be able to um you know it's

1433
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,280
hard to

1434
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,720
rebuild that trust with the teammates

1435
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,160
when they're being let down because the

1436
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,680
person's not able to do their job

1437
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,640
because

1438
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,760
they sounded good they looked good uh

1439
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,680
but they weren't honest so honestly is

1440
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,520
always a big thing and practicing that

1441
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,119
even actively every day once you're

1442
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:49,680
hired

1443
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,839
is really important and if it's honestly

1444
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:54,160
not working out for you the role

1445
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,040
i you know would always advise go to the

1446
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,000
person

1447
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,480
tell them you know you want some time

1448
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,920
there's so much friction it's just not

1449
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,560
working

1450
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,160
maybe they can help figure out a way to

1451
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,680
make it more successful for you

1452
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,599
or maybe they'll help you find another

1453
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:08,880
role where

1454
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,280
you can be successful so honesty is

1455
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:11,920
number one

1456
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,280
for my book excellent sarah

1457
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,359
all right so i i have two pieces of

1458
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:18,960
advice if you're you're new to the job

1459
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,880
market maybe just graduated

1460
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,319
um you're on the job market for the

1461
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,960

any any of your personal projects to

1465
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,040
your resume

1466
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,680
it doesn't need to be only professional

1467
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,640
experiences or

1468
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,920
official internships if you're worried

1469
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,839
about your resume being more than one

1470
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,280
page

1471
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,880
you know put it in a get repository

1472
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,880
build out your linkedin get all that

1473
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,720
information in there

1474

we don't look at paper resumes anymore

1475
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,240
so if you put that link

1476
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,240
at the top of your resume we're gonna

1477
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,359
click it you can get

1478
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,280
all sorts of great information in there

1479
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,599
we can really see your personality

1480
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,599
and your linkedin and your get and

1481
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:02,960
everything design it

1482
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,960
for a non-technical person like me so

1483
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,200
that i can follow along

1484
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,040
and then the second thing i would say to

1485
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,040
folks that are new

1486
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,319
it's really daunting right now um we are

1487
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:15,200
officially

1488
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,839
in a recession the market is flooded

1489
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:18,720
with applicants

1490
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,839
it's it's so scary um

1491
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:24,160
but don't be scared uh we did this in

1492
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,359
2001

1493
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:28,160
i told you i lost my job and in 2009

1494
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,480
because of the great recession

1495
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,960
we survived it then and we will we'll

1496
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,040
get through this this time as well

1497
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,079
and so just be aware there's a couple of

1498
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:39,760
things that

1499
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,240
you should know you you might end up in

1500
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,920
a job that you kind of have to settle

1501
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,400
for

1502
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,599
to pay the bills it it's going to happen

1503
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:50,480
um you may end up in a career that you

1504
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,920
never expected though

1505
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,960
so so be open i wanted to get out of it

1506
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,520
and i got i got sucked more into it and

1507
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,160
then

1508
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,160
my career developed and i didn't even

1509
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,760
want to take the job but i did it

1510
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,119
reluctantly

1511
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,160
like i said to pay the bills um but on

1512
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,599
that note sometimes when you

1513
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:09,680
you do take it really go in with an open

1514
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,920
mind what can i learn from this okay i'm

1515
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,760
settling for something just because

1516
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,440
they've made me a reasonable offer and

1517
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,040
they seem nice enough and i'll go work

1518
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,000
for them

1519
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,760
now now you need to really figure out

1520
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,359
what you can learn from that

1521
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:24,960
exactly and uh you may and actually i'm

1522
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,079
not even gonna say may

1523
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,880
you are definitely at some point in your

1524
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:29,520
career

1525
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,800
gonna be in a job you don't like

1526
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,520
it happens it's not the end of the world

1527
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,079
just

1528
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,280
to keep at it um in terms of like

1529
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,880
reluctantly taking something it's like

1530
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,000
i would say you can't work

1531
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,640
for a company that you don't believe in

1532
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,680
what they do

1533
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,880
big picture right but you can work for a

1534
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:53,440
company

1535
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,839
in a job you don't like as long as the

1536
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,280
company

1537
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,319
is doing the right things so just yeah

1538
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,280
kind of be aware

1539
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,599
like when you think about well can i

1540
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,240
take this job it's not what i wanted but

1541
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,000
can i take it just think about really

1542
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,520
what the company does

1543
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,200
uh in the big picture and what their

1544
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,240
morals are and if they fall in line with

1545
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,839
how you feel and how you live your life

1546
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:17,680
that's really important

1547
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:21,280
um but you know just be patient

1548
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,240
um you know if you are honest like ping

1549
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,000
said if you make that honest effort you

1550
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,520
are hard-working

1551
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,319
that effort comes back to you it might

1552
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:32,079
take a long time to see

1553
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:34,160
the fruits of your labor but hang in

1554
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,240
there try not to be discouraged it does

1555
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,520
get hard when you you

1556
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,440
are pushing into that ats day after day

1557
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,520
and you get that rejection email that

00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,240

uh i was very fortunate that i had built

1666
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,280
an incredible security related network

1667
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,359
so my first few contracts were with

1668
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:06,960
people who had at one point been in my

1669
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,079
chain of command

1670
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,319
or had been management and that

1671
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:11,839
corporate vendor that went on to do

1672
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:13,680
other startups and so they would call me

1673
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,800
and say hey carlotta

1674
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,480
can you do the things can you come in

1675
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,079
and look at this and set this up in a

1676
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:18,880
way

1677
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,319
in terms of content management and

1678
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:22,400
collaboration to prevent the problems

1679
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,160
that you were paid to solve at that

1680
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,200
major denver

1681
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,240
right um and that was that's very much

1682
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,000
about the relationship that's very much

1683
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,160
about your work speaking for itself

1684
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,160
um a lot of my clients have worked with

1685
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,559
me in some capacity my favorite client

1686
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:37,839
the

1687
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:40,079
um i worked with all my capstones and my

1688
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:41,040
masters

1689
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,680
and when i decided to to fight the

1690
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,160
bullet

1691
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,400
and do that vcso role for them even

1692
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,799
though i've never been abuso i've been a

1693
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:50,160
vcio and i've got

1694
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,760
lots of programmatic experience and i

1695
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,200
certainly knew more about security than

1696
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,240
they did

1697
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,799
um but it's that trust relationship

1698
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:57,520
right

1699
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,680
uh they believed that i was capable of

1700
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,119
leading them of guiding them through

1701
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,400
that process

1702
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,200
and that's really important uh so for me

1703
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,720
those career changes were very much

1704
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,640
about the relationships that i had built

1705
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:12,160
which is why when i try to

1706
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,960
connect people with roles and companies

1707
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,480
that maybe i don't even work with

1708
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,200
directly

1709
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,240
uh i do leverage my network excessively

1710
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:20,640
to

1711
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,480
to say hey i've met this really

1712
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,920
fantastic person at this

1713
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,119
at this career village at tdi um i think

1714
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:28,880
they'd be a great fit for you

1715
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,119
if you have anything reject them right

1716
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,040
i'm very much about the

1717
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,960
using my relationship and my experience

1718
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,160
to help other people

1719
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,960
and especially as shelby had had out of

1720
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,559
question about you know it's

1721
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:42,960
really hard it's really hard for black

1722
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,079
and indigenous people

1723
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:47,359
to break into any tech or security role

1724
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:49,200
and it's important that that people and

1725
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,520
i'm half filipino so i

1726
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,839
i can't claim to have the same

1727
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:56,480
experience because i'm white enough

1728
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,920
um in a lot of situations uh but i am in

1729
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,799
the south so sometimes i'm not right so

1730
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:05,920
uh but it's especially important that i

1731
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:06,480
use

1732
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,200
my relationships that i've built to help

1733
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:09,760
to help

1734
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,839
black women and black men and indigenous

1735
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:12,799
people

1736
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:15,200
break into places where i feel like they

1737
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,240
they would be valued

1738
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,799
right so that's that's a lot of of what

1739
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:20,880
i do now

1740
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,400
awesome and one thing that i could

1741
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,720
actually offer is

1742
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,400
never be afraid to be an advocate for

1743
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,920
yourself right

1744
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,359
absolutely absolutely because uh i

1745
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:33,920
i'm a i'm a single stay-at-home dad of

1746
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,119
two

1747
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:38,079
and my my son was classified as special

1748
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:39,440
needs several years ago

1749
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,200
and my mom actually lives with us as

1750
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,760
well and so there are certain jobs that

1751
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:44,000
i

1752
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,160
can't do certain tasks that i can't

1753
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,119
accomplish

1754
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:48,720
because of that because that is higher

1755
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,880
on my personal priority list

1756
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,799
and when going in for jobs i had to

1757
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:54,319
refuse jobs

1758
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:57,359
because i put that as my priority

1759
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,599
and as ping said i was honest if i

1760
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:00,960
wasn't honest yeah maybe i would have

1761
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,839
gotten the job

1762
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:04,079
but it would have hurt us and them in

1763
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:05,040
the long run

1764
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,440
i would have uh you know lost that trust

1765
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,480
with the company

1766
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,240
and then when i had to tell them no it

1767
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,000
would have caused a big commotion

1768
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,240
but bottom line is then i may have to go

1769
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,119
do something

1770
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:16,960
that would take me away from what i felt

1771
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,240
was my priority

1772
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,280
so that would be my one my one thing

1773
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,079
is advocate for yourself um and hold

1774
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:25,599
true to your integrity to your

1775
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:27,680
poor ethics i've i've certainly told

1776
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:28,640
companies of

1777
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,319
flat out i've sold managers like if you

1778
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:31,680
want me to do that then

1779
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,520
uh i'm out this afternoon you can hire

1780
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,599
somebody else on monday i won't do that

1781
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:37,599
let me explain integrity to you i have

1782
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:39,440
used those words so

1783
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,280
and as we discussed earlier don i grew

1784
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,280
up very poor and in my case

1785
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,880
and as you've said earlier in the career

1786
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,000
village

1787
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,920
some of us who grew up very poor become

1788
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,599
very like my brother he wants very

1789
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,520
stable he wants a steady paycheck

1790
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,559
he's he's not he's a little fearful so

1791
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:58,319
he doesn't grow as much and he doesn't

1792
00:57:58,319 --> 00:57:59,599
reach his potential

1793
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:02,559
i am very fortunate i don't have anyone

1794
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:04,319
at the time early in my career i didn't

1795
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:05,839
have anyone relying on me

1796
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:08,640
so i okay i'll eat ramen for a few

1797
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:09,920
months until i find the world that's

1798
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,119
right for me

1799
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:13,359
um so i was not afraid to literally

1800
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:14,799
couch surf and be homeless

1801
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:16,799
and eat ramen for a few months six

1802
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:18,400
months even a year sometimes

1803
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,960
while i kind of held true to my own core

1804
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,599
i have some separate follow-up questions

1805
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:29,119
for each one of you but i know this is

1806
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:30,880
an important topic so each of you

1807
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,640
please feel free to add on to what you

1808
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:35,359
just heard so for carlotta i love that

1809
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:36,720
she you know we talk about advocating

1810
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:37,839
for yourself because

1811
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:39,680
um number one is be a good advocate as

1812
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,160
in whenever you post into social media

1813
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,079
it's going to follow you forever and

1814
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:45,359
there are employers that will

1815
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:47,440
research that so be very careful what

1816
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,680
you're absolutely good

1817
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,359
the other thing is that when the offer

1818
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:53,200
comes right we've talked about how to

1819
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,480
get your foot in the door

1820
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,559
you know things during the interview

1821
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:58,160
think about what it is that you really

1822
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:58,960
want

1823
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,960
and what it is that you really need and

1824
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,400
i'm going to speak very specifically

1825
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,240
about salary okay because

1826
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,240
there are a lot of people who are like i

1827
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,280
want a quarter

1828
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:11,200
million dollars i am two years out of

1829
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,640
college i mean this followed me even

1830
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,839
when i was a designer everyone thought

1831
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:15,280
they would be millionaires like the

1832
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,880
first year out they're going to work

1833
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,799
right at some point i'm becoming a

1834
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:20,000
creative director right

1835
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,119
like okay think about what it is that

1836
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:25,680
you really need to make your ends meet

1837
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,240
okay what it is you want and you have to

1838
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,079
be very honest again with yourself

1839
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:32,880
and advocate i'm sorry i need an

1840
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,640
additional five thousand dollars because

1841
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,520
i cannot meet my household you know

1842
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,280
expenses because

1843
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,680
you're here it is this the the dream job

1844
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,680
but it it's not paying enough

1845
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,520
don't go in there thinking once you get

1846
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,640
in here i'm going to prove to them

1847
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,599
they're going to be able to

1848
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:49,599
there are budget constraints there are

1849
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:51,119
political things that go

1850
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:55,440
in there um if you need to make 50 000

1851
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,559
and they're offering you 42 ask for the

1852
00:59:58,559 --> 00:59:59,359
50

1853
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:01,839
right and just be honest about it and

1854
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:03,440
it's the same when you go to

1855
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,880
to ask you know if you feel you've been

1856
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,359
passed over have a conversation about

1857
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:09,119
you know i i thought i was being

1858
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:10,799
considered for the promotion for the

1859
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:11,359
role

1860
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:13,520
i want to talk about you know why it was

1861
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,839
i was passed over so that i can improve

1862
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:17,599
um but advocate for yourself don't be

1863
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:18,960
afraid some people

1864
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,040
especially i find with women and we

1865
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,720
interview so many more men than women

1866
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,640
just because of the disparity and

1867
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:27,920
engender in the industry women are like

1868
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,200
we have to have all the check marks

1869
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:29,760
where i won't

1870
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,119
interview for the role because i've had

1871
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:33,119
people i'm like why didn't you apply

1872
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:35,839
i can't talk to you unless you apply

1873
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:36,160
like

1874
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,520
i didn't meet all the things and i'm

1875
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,079
like well that guy had like three of the

1876
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,200
seven hopeful things right

1877
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,880
right but he talked the game that was

1878
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,240
the confidence but i said

1879
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,079
but you're a far more competent our

1880
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:50,319
operator than that person is right

1881
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:53,680
and so just be honest and advocate for

1882
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,839
yourself if there is a role that you

1883
01:00:55,839 --> 01:00:56,559
really want to

1884
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:58,960
pursue no one can consider that resume

1885
01:00:58,960 --> 01:00:59,680
unless you

1886
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,920
send it in and then when you have an

1887
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,440
offer in front of you

1888
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,440
be very honest yes it's nice to always

1889
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,599
make more money or have 100 vacation

1890
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:11,200
days versus 10. what is it that you need

1891
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,880
versus what it is that you want and can

1892
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,319
you compromise to get there

1893
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:16,319
negotiate that that's your next the next

1894
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:18,079
thing is the art of the negotiation but

1895
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:20,160
that's a that's a whole different issue

1896
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,359
sarah why are you nodding a lot do you

1897
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:22,880
have something to add to that you know

1898
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,640
so i was gonna say the same

1899
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,480
the same thing as ping where that the

1900
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,000
whole like oh i only have

1901
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,480
nine out of ten so i'm not gonna apply

1902
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:31,119
and you've

1903
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:32,799
you've got the gentleman over here who

1904
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,960
has one out of ten and then

1905
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,040
he still applies and i think that is

1906
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,880
probably a little bit of an exaggeration

1907
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:39,760
but it's not

1908
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,440
so far from the truth um so what you

1909
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,359
really do need to do is look at yourself

1910
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:47,520
and go well i only have

1911
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,599
you know maybe eight or nine out of the

1912
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:50,559
ten things

1913
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:53,520
but i've also got five or ten other

1914
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:54,079
things

1915
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:57,039
that aren't even on this list and i can

1916
01:01:57,039 --> 01:01:57,440
use

1917
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:00,559
those to supplement and do great things

1918
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:02,000
for this company so

1919
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,799
convince yourself talk to yourself about

1920
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:06,000
the other great things

1921
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,720
that you do have that supplement those

1922
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:09,680
shortcomings

1923
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,760
and you can actually help and do things

1924
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:12,960
for that company

1925
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,119
um you know once you have a few years

1926
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:16,799
under your belt it definitely changes

1927
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,559
your confidence but

1928
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:21,359
one thing i always do before i go into a

1929
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:22,319
job interview

1930
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:25,200
is i get on glassdoor and i look at all

1931
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,720
the reviews and i look at

1932
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,880
what all the people all the negative

1933
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,240
things that are on there right

1934
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,480
i look at what problems a company if you

1935
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,240
can can if you can assess some of the

1936
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,839
problems the company is having

1937
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:37,599
and you can walk into that interview and

1938
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:41,359
say hey here's how i can help you

1939
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:43,599
it'll it'll blow them away if you can go

1940
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:45,599
in and say here's what i'm going to do

1941
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:47,200
for you like i know this is your job

1942
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,480
description

1943
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:50,079
but i've got a couple more things to add

1944
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:51,440
for it and here's here's what i'm going

1945
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,240
to do for you but

1946
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,480
yeah having that confidence i'm going to

1947
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,160
jump in there on the salary but

1948
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,799
um i i got into the habit of asking for

1949
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:01,520
what i wanted to make in five years

1950
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,920
because if they came close to it then i

1951
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,839
knew that they valued what i'm bringing

1952
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:08,880
um if if they matched it then if i don't

1953
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,200
get a raise for five years that's fine

1954
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:14,240
you know and it works out uh and the

1955
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,480
number of times that people matched it

1956
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,880
were very good uh even once i had it

1957
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:19,599
exceeded

1958
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:22,160
so absolutely and that and recruiters

1959
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:22,799
are great

1960
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,039
i love i love recruiters area i really

1961
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:27,280
love you this one i worked for netflix

1962
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,520
netflix at the time paid notoriously

1963
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,280
well by silicon valley

1964
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:34,000
standards so when they made they they

1965
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,039
literally said to me

1966
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:36,880
um what's it going to take to get you

1967
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,640
out of this company and come work for us

1968
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,160
and i named what i thought was an absurd

1969
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:40,720
number

1970
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:41,760
and they went great can you start on

1971
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,799
monday and i was like oh crap

1972
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:47,839
that is awesome well when i left there

1973
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:50,079
i i you know called recruiters when i

1974
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:51,760
was finally ready to go back to work i'm

1975
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:52,960
very much about leaving

1976
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,400
taking a few months off and then looking

1977
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,880
for a job um because i like to detox

1978
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:57,520
right

1979
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,200
uh when i started talking to recruiters

1980
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,640
i was like look i i know i probably

1981
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:01,440
won't make it

1982
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,520
what i was making it right at netflix

1983
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:04,960
and the recruiters

1984
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,640
three out of three really because i

1985
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,079
think i can get you more

1986
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:11,520
right so recruiters are your friend yeah

1987
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,280
yeah recruiters are your friend when

1988
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,520
they're not working for the company

1989
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,480
right yep yeah very cool well on that

1990
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:19,520
positive note
