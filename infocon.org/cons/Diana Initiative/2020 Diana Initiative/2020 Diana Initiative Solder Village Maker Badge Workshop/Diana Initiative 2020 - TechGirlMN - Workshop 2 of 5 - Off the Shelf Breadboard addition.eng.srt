1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,120
also we'll get

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,560
started so welcome this is the

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,920
off-the-shelf breadboard edition

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,720
and we'll just

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,720
and we'll just wipe over oh look at that

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,760
and we'll take that off and that off

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,079
the joys of of quarantine and having to

8
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,800
do everything yourself yeah

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,760
and then i do have a

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
little camera there that and we might

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,520
look at if we need to look at anything

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,960
up close

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,440
um so hi i'm chris aka techgirl mn on

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,719
twitter

15
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,760
um and so what we're going to do in this

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,719
session

17
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,520
is we're going to build one of these on

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,840
there

19
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,720
and so is everybody ready to get started

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:13,840
oh we need video it's not

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,479
okay everybody see my hand my sparkly

22
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:21,920
nails and the breadboard

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,840
thank you okay everybody good

24
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,360
yeah i don't have enough usb ports to do

25
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,520
a face cam as well so

26
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,280
i figured this stuff here a little more

27
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,960
important than seeing my

28
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,119
shining face and purple hair so bear

29
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,520
with me

30
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,680
all right

31
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,840
okay so everybody got their breadboard

32
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,479
ready

33
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,520
and their stuff

34
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,840
huh

35
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,480
interesting

36
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,840
yep

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:37,840
let me ping nicole here

38
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,519
all right oh good see

39
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,000
jj's got us covered i just pinged nicole

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,480
oh well

41
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,519
so we'll move on to the presentation

42
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,040
here

43
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,080
all right so this is a solderless

44
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,120
breadboard

45
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,680
um basically it's a hunk of plastic or

46
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,640
acrylic

47
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,239
that's got these nice little clips in

48
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,000
there so that something you put in

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,400
this pin or this hole is connected to

50
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,280
this hole

51
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,799
and then there's a separate clip for

52
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,480
those

53
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,760
and then actually these are one big long

54
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,799
that's not flat

55
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,040
okay

56
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,000
um so that's the way this works um

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,599
is that there's full of these little

58
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,879
clips that'll let you make the

59
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,159
connections

60
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,680
um so what we're going to do

61
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,680
is we're actually going to do this a

62
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,680
little bit different order

63
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,879
than if you were um at the first session

64
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,319
the tinkercad session

65
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,640
or actually i think it is the same so

66
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,400
we're going to start with

67
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,439
the arduino nano

68
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,400
and this is basically everything that

69
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,040
was

70
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,159
part of that arduino uno that we used in

71
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,680
the virtual session

72
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,358
just in a nice little breadboard

73
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,238
friendly package

74
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,519
so what we want to do is we want to

75
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,040
start at one end of the board

76
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,320
and you're going to put one set of pins

77
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,440
in

78
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,440
one side and one set in the other

79
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,880
and then you're going to push really

80
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,160
really hard because this is a new

81
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,639
breadboard

82
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,360
and like that and so now all of these

83
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,840
pins on either side

84
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,919
side we can actually use by plugging in

85
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,560
our jumpers

86
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,840
to the corresponding holes on the

87
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,840
breadboard

88
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,800
all right we'll just give that a minute

89
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,560
make sure that everybody

90
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:11,840
is ready

91
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,039
um no it does not matter if it's exactly

92
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,800
center because it's not never going to

93
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,440
be exactly center

94
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,199
um you're always always going to end up

95
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,000
with um

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,240
basically three usable holes on one side

97
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,000
and two on the other

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,479
so no they're never center so you're

99
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,800
fine

100
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:39,840
all right

101
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,280
all right and just like the other

102
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,759
project

103
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,199
next we're going to move on to our

104
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,560
resistors and we're going to make sure

105
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,080
that they go into the negative rail

106
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,800
for those of you who are at the earlier

107
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,720
session this morning

108
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,240
we we had a little fun

109
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,080
because i wasn't awake yet um

110
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,120
this let me pop it pop over to the other

111
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,919
camera here

112
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,319
pop over to the other camera

113
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,840
and so this is a 2

114
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,919
120 ohm resistor this is a 5 band so

115
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,479
it's supposed to be

116
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,680
resistor and it's got lights bad in here

117
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,880
i think it's red red brown brown black

118
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,639
or my vision's going bad and it's

119
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,039
something else

120
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,280
either way 220 ohms they should have

121
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,160
been marked

122
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,199
in your thing um i don't have a

123
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,240
uh beige 4 band handy otherwise i'd show

124
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,120
you what that looks like as well

125
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,800
so back over here

126
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,479
and we're going to put in seven of these

127
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,520
and you want to kind of space them out

128
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,960
um particular numbers are not super

129
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,520
duper

130
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,000
important just make sure that you have

131
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,960
enough room

132
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,479
in between the resistors for the big

133
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,560
leds

134
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,840
because they do take up some space

135
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,520
so we're just going to continue on with

136
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:30,880
our 220s

137
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,080
and let me make up some more here

138
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,639
and this is a handy tool i have no idea

139
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,319
where you would find one these days

140
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,680
um i bought this back

141
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,599
when i was taking my birthday money to

142
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,719
radio shack so

143
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,720
good luck

144
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,840
but they do give you a nice bend

145
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,080
and so we've got two

146
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,840
three

147
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
four

148
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,440
five

149
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,800
six and one more for

150
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,839
seven

151
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,800
okay yeah this is a component bending

152
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,440
tool

153
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,800
um since you're asking and like i said i

154
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,200
wouldn't know where to get one i bought

155
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,279
i've had this for a very long time i

156
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,800
think i got it at radio shack

157
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,519
and like tully said there's a there's a

158
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,399
stencil there's a 3d printed stencil on

159
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,440
on thingiverse um so yeah i've had this

160
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,959
for a very long time as you can see it's

161
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,839
radio shack red

162
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,000
all right so you should now have your

163
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,040
arduino

164
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,080
and seven little resistors

165
00:09:52,080 --> 00:10:05,360
so i am going

166
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,120
so i'm going to go ahead and once again

167
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,880
we're going to do the ready check thing

168
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,800
to make sure that everybody is ready to

169
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:19,839
move on to the next

170
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,120
all right and now these are the leds

171
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,720
um these are actually big ones they're

172
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,720
kind of

173
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,880
oversized they're 10 millimeters

174
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,360
it's actually more common three and five

175
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,000
millimeter

176
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,279
are more common um

177
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,240
than the 10 but the 10 are nice and give

178
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,360
a nice

179
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,640
big effect um for those boards

180
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,399
so we've got the long leg

181
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,680
which is going to be the

182
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,519
positive anode and the short leg which

183
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,120
is the negative cathode

184
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,880
and it seems like no matter how many

185
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
times i looked that up and write that

186
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,800
down i never remember it

187
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,480
so that's what i was doing in between

188
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,839
sessions to be honest

189
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,720
so let's get these set up so what we're

190
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,440
going to want to do here

191
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,200
is we take the short leg and we pop it

192
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,360
in

193
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,720
there and this one's going to need to

194
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,560
sit sideways so that

195
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,920
the short leg the negative the leg the

196
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,640
cathode is going through the resistor

197
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,040
and into the negative rail

198
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,399
and maybe yeah there we go

199
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,839
and then we've got one last hole back

200
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,079
here

201
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,479
to hook to run to the arduino

202
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,439
so let's flip over

203
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,440
to the other camera here

204
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,360
and see if we can't get in real close

205
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,440
to kind of do the next one

206
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,079
okay so as you can see i've got the one

207
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,120
blue led here

208
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,240
already done and then here is the second

209
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,079
blue led sorry this is

210
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,399
a microscope camera so it's really

211
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,000
sensitive

212
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,760
and there's that and as you can see

213
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,680
we've got the resistor

214
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,360
into the negative legs and then

215
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,560
this one it looks like about pin 41

216
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,880
so we're going to want to flip this over

217
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,160
drop the

218
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,839
short leg into

219
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,839
4 the long leg into 40 and then the

220
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,240
short leg into 41

221
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,720
and one other note here

222
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,680
um and you'll probably see that me do

223
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,720
this in between

224
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,519
this session and then the coding session

225
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,000
is that

226
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,639
if you need or want to you can trim

227
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,399
these legs down so that your components

228
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,720
sit a little closer to the board

229
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,920
that does kind of help make them not so

230
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,120
wobbly

231
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,120
so i will so i'm not going to take the

232
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,720
time to do that now

233
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,680
but just be aware that that is entirely

234
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,160
an option

235
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,519
so let's go back to where we can see the

236
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,920
whole breadboard

237
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,839
yeah what the heck

238
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,399
yes i'm having fun with the the really

239
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,519
spiffy

240
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,920
trial of of vmix software

241
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,680
i can't afford it once i have to pay for

242
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,639
it but it's really nice to use now

243
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,959
so let's move on to our green leds and

244
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:51,680
once again

245
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,560
short leg matching up to the resistor

246
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:03,040
long leg in the one next to it

247
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,360
and there's yet another green led yes

248
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,620
it's oriented correctly

249
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,399
[Music]

250
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,440
and we'll keep going

251
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,560
and then we've got our yellows

252
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,839
same deal

253
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,199
and yeah definitely going to cut these

254
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,079
later on

255
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:59,839
and then finally our red

256
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,920
and there's our setup

257
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,839
and they're fairly even

258
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,600
you'll get this where they kind of like

259
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,199
to

260
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,040
boop a little in the clips and that's

261
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,680
why um like i said before we get serious

262
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,880
about the code i'm gonna

263
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:41,839
i'll probably clean this up a little bit

264
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,120
all right yes the short leg goes into

265
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,120
the same hole as resistor let's

266
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,240
clean up clean these up here because if

267
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,839
i'm doing that i'm not seeing the chat

268
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,680
so i do apologize

269
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,000
i say okay and looks like jj got that

270
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,199
all right

271
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,920
and yep

272
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,600
so yes these five pins have nothing to

273
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,120
do with these five pins and that will

274
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,440
come

275
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,839
become important in a minute all right

276
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,480
all right and

277
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,160
i think we'll go ahead and give another

278
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,079
ready check and then we'll get these

279
00:16:50,079 --> 00:17:05,839
hooked up to the arduino

280
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,359
all right so these are our jumpers um

281
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,199
i've split them off into one set of

282
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,439
colors so that it's easier to

283
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,959
color code pull out the ones i need to

284
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,359
color code um

285
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,880
now a thing with the jumpers is that

286
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,600
going forward go to ally express or wish

287
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,000
and pay like a buck and wait a month for

288
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,880
a new bundle

289
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,080
um these things um

290
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,080
depending on what you're using them for

291
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,679
you want to almost consider them

292
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,400
disposable

293
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,679
because they're nice they work real well

294
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:52,080
but

295
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,799
they're not always perfect so the first

296
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,120
thing we're going to do

297
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,559
is we're going to take off these black

298
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,559
and these white ones the black and the

299
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,840
white one

300
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,120
and we're going to now let's use this

301
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,400
into the board

302
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,600
and what we want to do is we want to

303
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,240
make sure that when we're sharing

304
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,760
that when the board gets powered up that

305
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,360
both rails are powered so we're going to

306
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,360
take the white

307
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,840
and go from the positive rail to the

308
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,160
positive rail

309
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,760
and then the black negative

310
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,679
to negative and you're

311
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,559
and so now that we know when we're

312
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,640
plugged in that both these rails will

313
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,440
work

314
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,039
fine because we've got a ground

315
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,400
that will eventually hook up here and

316
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,520
a 5 volts somewhere over there

317
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,280
all right so let's get the leds hooked

318
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,520
up first so i'm going to rip out a blue

319
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,760
one

320
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,960
that's so oddly satisfying okay

321
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,760
so our led has two legs now the one leg

322
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,679
the short leg that goes to the resistor

323
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:04,880
we want to go

324
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,640
we want to leave that alone and put our

325
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,160
jumper into the positive leg

326
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,200
and we're actually going to work

327
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,720
backwards here from the

328
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,840
pin and oh i'm a little short

329
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:26,000
cd 78 yep oh these are a little short

330
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
you just give me one second here

331
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,520
and this is why we cut them this is why

332
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,960
we get them

333
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,520
aren't live demos fun i should have

334
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,000
recorded

335
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,320
this then i could list just listen to

336
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,799
the chat

337
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,799
and edited out all my mistakes okay so i

338
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,559
do have a longer one here

339
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:53,840
thankfully so there we go positive leg

340
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,720
d8

341
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,480
big long cable awesome and so then we're

342
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,720
going to take this blue

343
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,200
and go to the one next to it

344
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,600
um and here's a pro tip on the

345
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,799
breadboards

346
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,520
um when you're putting in when you have

347
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,919
to use holes next to each other

348
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,520
try to stagger the the input so like if

349
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,000
these two are next to each other

350
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,120
this way you guys can see that

351
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,360
instead of putting them side by side

352
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,640
stagger them because you'll have an

353
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,400
easier time getting them in and out

354
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,559
later

355
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,840
so if we were using 20 and 21 here

356
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:49,840
we'd go 1 into 21a and the next into 21b

357
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,880
yep white positive to positive black

358
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,919
negative to negative

359
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,240
normally i might have used red there but

360
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,840
we got that going okay so now we're

361
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,640
going to use a green

362
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,159
for the same concept

363
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,440
and d6

364
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,080
and grab another grain off of another

365
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,039
set

366
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:26,559
still oddly satisfying and go

367
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,840
there

368
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,280
and there

369
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:45,360
and now we're on to our yellows

370
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,158
and same thing wire

371
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,840
breadboard

372
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,520
and wire and breadboard

373
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,159
which should leave us with one last red

374
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,960
at d2

375
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,840
okay

376
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,320
okay yes that's a jumbled mess most

377
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,240
breadboards are

378
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,159
okay so to review your red led

379
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,559
should be hooked up with a red jumper

380
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,600
wire

381
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,880
to where it's marked d2 on the board

382
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,919
yellow to d3 and d4

383
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,240
greens are five and d5 and d6

384
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,480
and blues are seven and eight

385
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,159
and the difference

386
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,360
is is that these are

387
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,440
digital pins they're either high or low

388
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,360
on or off some will have pmw which is

389
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,760
pulse width modulation which we're

390
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,120
not going to be playing with this

391
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,200
session and that's how you get the leds

392
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,280
to fade up and down

393
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,120
is they have to be on a pin with pulse

394
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,200
width modulation

395
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,120
so for now we're good we've got all of

396
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,240
our digital pins

397
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,880
here and here and

398
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,559
we'll go from there and once again i'm

399
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,480
going to ask for a ready check because i

400
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,600
don't want anybody to miss anything

401
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,960
thing i want to make sure that we all

402
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,279
kind of stay on the same page

403
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:51,840
we're at the same place

404
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,840
foreign

405
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,840
all right are we ready to continue

406
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,799
all right

407
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,120
all right so now we're going to work on

408
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,880
our button

409
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,880
and this one's a little different than

410
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,799
the one you've probably seen or the one

411
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,000
that we used

412
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,400
in the virtual session basically it's

413
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,080
just got a place to snap on a little

414
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,559
different colored cap

415
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,279
and it's got some bendy legs too okay so

416
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,840
just like

417
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,679
so just like in the virtual project

418
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,279
project if you were in that session as

419
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,400
well

420
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,840
we're going to snap this down to the end

421
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,840
of the breadboard

422
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,960
there we go maybe

423
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,320
or my legs are going to bend in

424
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,840
magic flying tools

425
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,679
and hopefully we can get this bent out

426
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,760
because if we break the pin i might

427
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,320
we might be sol or i might be sol

428
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,240
because i did not check my stocks on

429
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,880
buttons before

430
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,559
and alright so if you need to

431
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,240
bend the pins a little i'm actually

432
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,480
gonna take a moment here and flatten

433
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:10,000
these guys out

434
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,440
okay trying this again

435
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,159
baby come on you can do it

436
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,840
okay

437
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,600
that looks like it's in

438
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,559
all right so looks like we're actually

439
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,760
in this time

440
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,520
yay clicky clicky all right

441
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,559
so let's hook that up

442
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,120
and

443
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,880
so

444
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,000
i start with the back side first um so

445
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,520
here's another important tip

446
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,039
in fact i am going to do that that way

447
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,559
for you guys just so you see it

448
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,840
we use orange for the button if you only

449
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,279
ordered the one size

450
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,960
of jumpers and they're not quite long

451
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,720
enough

452
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,840
what you can do

453
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,760
is you can pick up a spare column here

454
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,200
and go to that spare column

455
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,960
and this is why they're considered

456
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,840
disposable if you can see that

457
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,799
let's try this again

458
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,760
we're gonna go from here

459
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,039
then we're just going to go into a

460
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,640
little any unused column

461
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,399
and then take another one

462
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,918
and go to 10

463
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,120
around and in and then stretch it over

464
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,159
and probably go over a couple just to

465
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,399
kind of even it out so

466
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,799
that's a handy tip if you're working

467
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,240
late at night you need to go from one

468
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,600
end to the other and you don't have long

469
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,480
jumpers

470
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,000
um just use a spare column

471
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,880
like that so now that we're connected to

472
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,600
the arduino

473
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,279
just like before here's our

474
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,480
110 pull-up resistor

475
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,039
and if you just give me one second let's

476
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:29,600
see that

477
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,719
see that on the big screen

478
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,039
there we go so

479
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,879
maybe i can get this in focus

480
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,000
there we go and that's what a 1k

481
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,720
resistor

482
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,679
looks like different color pattern

483
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,880
actually this should be a 10k excuse me

484
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,360
well i go grab the 10k resistors because

485
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,840
that was just laying on the work mention

486
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:13,600
now i'm not sure

487
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,720
i miss vegas i really do and

488
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,679
unlike our current limiting resistors on

489
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,600
the leds this is a pull-up so it's going

490
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:27,200
to go into the power

491
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,679
or no this one goes this one goes into

492
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:30,720
the negative two

493
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,360
never mind

494
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,880
i apparently need yet a third starbucks

495
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,679
run this morning

496
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,880
all right

497
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,200
so then we've got a green one

498
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,440
thank you john

499
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:57,360
d10 the button should be in d10

500
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,960
and i am still zoomed in

501
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,159
it would be nice if i could have had a

502
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,360
crew but you know

503
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,840
same reason we're not in vegas okay

504
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,960
so now we've pulled back out we've got

505
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,159
our

506
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,880
double jump here to the button we've got

507
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,120
our

508
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,919
we've got our pull-up and now we're

509
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:24,960
going to hook

510
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,399
this little green guy here into the

511
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:29,440
power

512
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,760
yay

513
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,840
all right so there are a couple more

514
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,840
connections that we need to make

515
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,960
um if you remember if you were at the

516
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,399
earlier session

517
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,159
um the arduino and the breadboard came

518
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,000
with a few things already plugged in

519
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,120
so we're going to replicate that now and

520
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,440
so

521
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,559
on your board on this side you're going

522
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,120
to see

523
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,200
some instead of seeing like say d5 or

524
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,720
whatever you're going to see a few other

525
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,760
ones let's

526
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,640
zoom in on that for a second

527
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,159
there we go look at that we'll wipe back

528
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,840
over here

529
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,080
okay so

530
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,720
there's our rat's nest there's the open

531
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,519
side

532
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:20,480
so what we're going to do is we're going

533
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,640
to start with a black one

534
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,840
and you can see it moving around there

535
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,919
and the black one needs to go from where

536
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:32,080
it says gnd that stands for ground

537
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,360
and it can go anywhere on that on the

538
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,760
negative rail

539
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,200
and we'll wipe back

540
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,440
and you can see it it's this one right

541
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,679
here that we've put from the ground to

542
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:46,960
the negative

543
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,840
now we'll wipe it back

544
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,120
and yeah that's right

545
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,559
okay and then we need one more

546
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,679
and we'll use brown just to keep things

547
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,360
kind of color coordinated here and we're

548
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,279
going to go from a pin that says

549
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,240
the pin that says 5v that's 5 volts

550
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,039
regulated

551
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,840
um

552
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,960
the other one here that's here on the

553
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,559
corner that's um

554
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,159
that's a voltage in pin and that is um

555
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,919
if we were to say hook up hook this up

556
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:28,559
to

557
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,679
say a nine volt battery or four double

558
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:32,480
a's

559
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,360
or anything between six and 20 volts you

560
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,960
can put on that pin and power your

561
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,360
project

562
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,559
within reason don't hook it up to a card

563
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:43,120
battery

564
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,600
not good

565
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,760
and then that'll go into the positive

566
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,919
rail and then those first two jumpers we

567
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:54,799
placed

568
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,840
let me get back out here

569
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,159
and then those first two jumpers we

570
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:01,679
placed will actually carry these

571
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:02,640
connections

572
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:11,840
over to the other side for our leds

573
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:25,840
all right so that is all the hookups

574
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,159
and so we'll go ahead

575
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,720
with one more

576
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,320
ready check also any questions

577
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,918
or if you need some help

578
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,200
help if you need to take the screen over

579
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,039
over and want me and want somebody to

580
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,279
check things now would be a good time

581
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:06,640
for that

582
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,200
okay

583
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,839
yeah bumped here there we go

584
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,359
yes five volt goes to positive and

585
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:35,839
ground is considered negative

586
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,280
so this is going to be kind of weird

587
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,000
because i need to

588
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,359
troubleshoot the ide on my pc because i

589
00:34:47,359 --> 00:35:03,839
do is um

590
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,839
so

591
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,319
all right now is

592
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:12,079
everybody more or less ready

593
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,040
since we do have some time i'll show you

594
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,290
how to

595
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:20,460
[Music]

596
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:27,839
do some light testing here

597
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,440
which is going to get really really

598
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:41,839
interesting

599
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,200
all right

600
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,520
so i'm gonna go ahead and plug this in

601
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,240
and just

602
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,320
like before we get the little built-in

603
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,240
led that'll blink

604
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,560
yay

605
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,760
all right hopefully i can nudge enough

606
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,200
room here

607
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,920
do bear with me guys um apparently at

608
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,200
some point

609
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,720
i mucked up my arduino ied on my big

610
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,520
gaming rig

611
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,680
the same rig that i'm screen i'm

612
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,359
streaming from

613
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,280
i actually do most of my coding on my

614
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,119
macbook

615
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,040
so what's going to happen is i'm going

616
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,200
to

617
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,920
to to i will show you the code because

618
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,880
the ied

619
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,320
does load well enough for me to show you

620
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,240
what the code is and then i'm going to

621
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,160
duplicate it on my macbook and send that

622
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:52,880
to them

623
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,960
to the arduino and

624
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,119
yeah so it's a little

625
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,079
f'd up but it's be okay all right so

626
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:04,880
we've got our

627
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,920
arduino we've got it blinking maybe

628
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,400
hopefully

629
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,560
yep if you haven't seen if you haven't

630
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,000
downloaded the arduino

631
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,839
software that's fine just watch along

632
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,320
and so we're going to flip over to

633
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,440
the desktop capture yay

634
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,760
and close that and go live

635
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,240
and that

636
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:47,839
and why is that not playing

637
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,920
and that's not what's supposed to be

638
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,079
there

639
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,839
oh come on

640
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,760
seriously

641
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:15,280
let's try going out

642
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,880
come on there we go

643
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,400
all right so we'll start back at the

644
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,920
beginning

645
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,800
i open my thing the arduino ide

646
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,680
the latest version

647
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,160
actually will bring automatically up the

648
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,240
blink sketch

649
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,560
this is the same code that is built in

650
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,560
and we're just going to modify that and

651
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,640
send it to the arduino

652
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,800
and the quickest way to do that is if

653
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,800
you take that blank line

654
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,839
line 24

655
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,359
and we're going to hashtag

656
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,000
define

657
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,800
and then we're going to pick a name and

658
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,200
for this case we're gonna go test

659
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,480
led and then we're gonna pick

660
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,480
the first of our pins that we used which

661
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,960
is two

662
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,280
so that basically we've defined test led

663
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,800
as a permanent variable set to two

664
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,800
and so now we can take the led built in

665
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:39,119
and be lazy and copy

666
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,560
and paste or not

667
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,040
really

668
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:53,839
happy

669
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:59,359
i always prefer if possible

670
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,200
copying and pasting variable names

671
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,599
because that way you don't

672
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,800
mess them up so now instead of using the

673
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,520
built-in led

674
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,079
so everywhere that says led built in

675
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,520
we're just going to

676
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,720
click in and say test led and then you

677
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,400
guys are going to hit upload but that's

678
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,200
going to give me an

679
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,879
error so let me do this one more time

680
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:35,839
over here

681
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,359
copy

682
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,160
paste

683
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,520
paste and then i should be able to

684
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,820
upload

685
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:11,140
[Music]

686
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:31,839
and so take care of this quick

687
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,359
and why aren't you working you worked

688
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,359
last night

689
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,759
sorry

690
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,839
oh that's fun

691
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,770
[Laughter]

692
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,000
yup that is the grab and go code

693
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,319
that's what happens when you share your

694
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:02,319
screen and you've got hop-in left up

695
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,920
as you go all the way down the little

696
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,839
rabbit hole

697
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:08,319
this is the screen that i meant to be

698
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:11,280
showing you and i do apologize

699
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,240
like i said no crew you want to hit

700
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:14,880
define

701
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,520
and then a variable test led is fine and

702
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,000
then

703
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,240
one of the numbered pins two through

704
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,280
eight

705
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,880
and then everywhere where it said

706
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,960
built-in led you want to replace that

707
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,119
with test led

708
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,160
and then we're going to click upload and

709
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:41,839
upload it to the arduino

710
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,319
oh come on all right

711
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,079
all right and

712
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,359
all right and i'm learning the hard way

713
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,240
in a in a

714
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:27,760
in a live demo why we don't use random

715
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,599
parts that have been left on the desk

716
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:36,160
for an indeterminate amount of time yes

717
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,680
you can feel free to laugh these are the

718
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,279
jokes they're the best i have

719
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:46,319
so let's go over here for a second

720
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:50,160
and

721
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,799
yes we are in the matrix um so

722
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,720
come on you want to upload you want to

723
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,319
upload comment

724
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:05,839
come on okay

725
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,800
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to

726
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,400
have to troubleshoot this

727
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,560
um i think this board was bad and i

728
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,240
instead of throwing it away i threw it

729
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,119
back in

730
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,160
my parts bin

731
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,760
but i do want to show you what the test

732
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,400
code does

733
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,720
so this is the off-the-shelf code that

734
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,359
jj linked

735
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:30,079
and it's actually blinking out the diane

736
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:31,599
initiative

737
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,520
in binary using the using the numbers

738
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,720
from

739
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,000
an ascii table as far as the

740
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,440
test code that i showed you

741
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,839
there we go

742
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,040
and that's not even the right code wow

743
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,520
let's try this one

744
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,680
so that's um some other test code that i

745
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,280
will actually uh

746
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,160
post courtesy of blenster who's used it

747
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,280
for

748
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,000
other things other programs that he's

749
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,079
ran

750
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:15,839
and let's try this one

751
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,319
i really miss vegas i really do miss

752
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,520
vegas

753
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,400
and there we can see

754
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,280
that's what your test blink sketch would

755
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,839
look like

756
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:33,440
should look like on your breadboards

757
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:42,400
and we'll flip this over to the blue one

758
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,640
and so every time you put change defined

759
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,599
to a different number

760
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:48,079
it's going to blank a different led now

761
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,119
my blue is blinking

762
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:57,839
any questions comments

763
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,880
um you didn't really miss it jay um what

764
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,800
happened was was that

765
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,160
the this arduino

766
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,359
here failed and it

767
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:27,440
just does not want to communicate so i

768
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,400
assumed it was my id ide and pulled up

769
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,200
my macbook

770
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,079
just to do the code just to upload the

771
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:34,960
code after i

772
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:39,520
showed it to you so i'm going to have to

773
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,920
redo this board tonight before we do the

774
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,119
uh

775
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,359
thing and yes the whole thing is they

776
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:48,319
all are recorded

777
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,200
as far as us using the the soldered

778
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,440
project that was

779
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,200
that was me doing trying to do some code

780
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,598
demo

781
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,400
and having a bad arduino bad bad evil

782
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,359
bad

783
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:07,680
all right

784
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,599
all right looks like vicky got the

785
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:11,599
grab-and-code

786
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:14,960
grab-and-go code to work

787
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:21,839
awesome

788
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,960
and the grab and go code um we're going

789
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:25,599
to work

790
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,800
with that on the recorded or on the

791
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,839
the advanced programming session

792
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:33,200
i'll go through what those different

793
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,839
things are and how to set up

794
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,680
additional letters if you want to change

795
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:48,800
the message

796
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,119
so

797
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,240
um those sessions are tomorrow

798
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:04,079
um there's there's another session in

799
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:07,839
um tinkercad

800
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:12,160
where we're gonna go through um

801
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,280
the flashy or the larson scanner where

802
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,079
it goes beep

803
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:17,440
where it goes from left to right and

804
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,599
then right to left

805
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,800
and then the later session

806
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,359
is going to be we're going to go through

807
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,200
the grab and go code

808
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,400
and uh and we'll talk a little bit about

809
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:30,960
creating

810
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,960
functions and loops and things like that

811
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,440
in that one

812
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:45,520
and in fact i think

813
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:59,119
i get on the right keyboard here

814
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:01,119
so as a preview this is the code we'll

815
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:02,160
be writing for

816
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,598
the tinkercad project

817
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:12,400
and then

818
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,440
this is the code

819
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:19,119
[Music]

820
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:22,720
and this is the off-the-shelf code

821
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:26,590
and then we'll take the

822
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:27,920
[Music]

823
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,760
and then both projects what we'll do is

824
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,839
we'll keep the button simple

825
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:34,000
and i don't have it in this particular

826
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:34,880
version but

827
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,559
basically it'll work if the button's

828
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:38,240
pressed and then not work and save on

829
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,760
your battery

830
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,319
when you don't want to show it off yes

831
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:43,040
all of the

832
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,160
all of the sessions are recorded

833
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,520
and thank you for the comment on my

834
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:55,040
nails i appreciate that

835
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,200
um and i do kind of feel bad that some

836
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,520
of this stuff isn't working

837
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,359
but you know you can plan and test all

838
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:02,720
you want and then of course

839
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:07,118
the day of something's going to go wrong

840
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,440
so yes the hardware stuff is in the

841
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,880
sessions

842
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,960
um everything is being recorded recorded

843
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:19,599
um i do have

844
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:24,640
um nothing is perfect this is fun thank

845
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:25,760
you jen

846
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,359
thank you very much um does anybody have

847
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:31,119
any questions for me

848
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:33,040
want to take over the screen see if they

849
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,319
can get it see if they're

850
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:39,040
see if i can see something to uh

851
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,960
something's not working right um yes

852
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,800
apparently i did not sacrifice enough

853
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,240
blood to the demo gods

854
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:51,839
um either that or

855
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,800
either that or i haven't drank enough um

856
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,400
it's going to be one of those two things

857
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,760
i'm not sure which

858
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:04,400
at this point

859
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,119
um right now are you referring to this

860
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:07,760
switch here

861
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,400
the big button

862
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,960
okay the big button is actually set up

863
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:19,200
to be input and right now

864
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,520
with the grab and go code i don't have

865
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,640
it doing anything

866
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,200
it's just there for your own

867
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,079
experimentation with the grab and go

868
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:28,400
code

869
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,200
we will have it do something during

870
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:47,839
tomorrow's session

871
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:59,280
alrighty then so since we have a half an

872
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,559
hour

873
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:02,640
we might as well troubleshoot this so

874
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,759
i'm going to take this away

875
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,200
and

876
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,200
close my poor abused macbook yes with

877
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,160
all the awesome stickers

878
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,040
a little bright

879
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:29,040
oh god i loved i i love live demos i

880
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,000
really do love

881
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,720
live demos

882
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,240
okay so i'm gonna pull this apart

883
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,359
new inbox hopefully we'll keep our

884
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:41,119
fingers crossed

885
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:43,839
um

886
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,240
and maybe we can actually get this to

887
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,119
work on a breadboard

888
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:52,160
okay and i'm going to use these these

889
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:52,480
are

890
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,640
esd tweezers these ones have a round tip

891
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,200
as opposed to some of the other ones

892
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,559
that i have that are

893
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:03,680
nice and pointy um and you can do this

894
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,599
pretty much with any tweezers or small

895
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:07,040
screwdrivers

896
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,720
and to get something like this off a

897
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,760
breadboard it's a little

898
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,400
stiff and

899
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,000
and sticky so we just kind of ease it up

900
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,400
um you're it's much easier to do if you

901
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:25,839
have a tool versus your fingers

902
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:33,119
and we'll try this again

903
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:36,160
come on come on baby okay come on you

904
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,960
worthless piece of

905
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,240
bleepity bleep bleep bleep

906
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,880
yay there we go

907
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,799
okay who wants an arduino i'm not sure

908
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:57,759
if it works or not

909
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,839
raffle it off

910
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,200
no we're not ruffling off the the sad

911
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,960
dead arduino

912
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,359
we're gonna just put it over here in the

913
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:21,839
trash can

914
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,359
come on out little buddy come on out

915
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:40,319
okay ooh shiny oh tape

916
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,520
okay so let's see if we can get this

917
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,920
lined up

918
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,559
once again

919
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:56,558
and down

920
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:03,359
and back macbook

921
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,760
yes yes if you ever meet a member of the

922
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,040
lonely

923
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,880
hackers club ask them where austin is

924
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,720
do you need no more context than that

925
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,839
they will laugh there they will laugh

926
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:17,520
hysterically

927
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:21,680
so it powers yay

928
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:31,839
and let's see if we get

929
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,920
come on buddy you want to do it you want

930
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,920
to do the thing

931
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,920
you want to do the thing do the thing

932
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:45,839
all right tools

933
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:53,940
serial ports right arduino isp

934
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:56,839
[Music]

935
00:56:56,839 --> 00:56:59,839
so

936
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:13,839
to do

937
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,599
maybe maybe not

938
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,319
i love live demos i really do love die

939
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:27,200
life demos

940
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,520
how could we okay let's ask some some

941
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,240
ques answer some questions here

942
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,960
since my breadboard is still not working

943
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:35,920
which is

944
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,480
actually kind of embarrassing but we'll

945
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,000
we'll work on it

946
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,799
um so how can we check on which com port

947
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:43,760
our board is

948
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:48,400
based on um yeah if i reboot my pc we'd

949
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,200
lose the stream

950
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,160
but i can't answer that one so if we go

951
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,520
back here

952
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:58,319
to the ide

953
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,319
up at the top there'll be a tools

954
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,079
section

955
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:04,079
and you can pick which board you're

956
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:06,480
using

957
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,440
so lots of lots of little

958
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,520
physical computers work well with with

959
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,440
this particular ide

960
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:19,440
um it should be a nano it should be

961
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:25,680
a 328 and should ideally be the omega

962
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,720
328p um if it's not working

963
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,799
try the second option which is the old

964
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:32,640
bootloader

965
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,880
i have found that some of that some of

966
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,079
them especially if you

967
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:39,359
got them um especially with these clones

968
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:41,760
are still coming out from china with the

969
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,000
old bootloader versus the new one

970
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,160
and then serial ports right now

971
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,520
apparently the only thing i have hooked

972
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,440
up is

973
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,760
i have no idea what's on com1 right now

974
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,839
to be honest i don't

975
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:59,119
um genuine boards that are like

976
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,440
five times what you probably paid for

977
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,400
this one

978
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,559
uh we'll do two command two-way

979
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:06,160
communication and you'll get the board a

980
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:06,799
bit

981
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:09,920
board information

982
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:13,040
from them

983
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,960
so that was that question yeah yeah

984
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,920
let's go back see what else i can answer

985
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:24,559
for everybody

986
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,520
yeah no i'm actually very

987
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:35,920
precariously balancing my macbook air

988
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,440
to try to run code to

989
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,280
to the breadboard um that looks right

990
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,319
that looks right that looks right i'll

991
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:50,079
try the new boot loader just to see

992
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,440
ah there we go

993
00:59:58,839 --> 01:00:03,599
yay so apparently

994
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:06,079
the new inbox nana wanted the new

995
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:09,599
bootloader versus the old one

996
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:13,200
[Laughter]

997
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:13,950
oh

998
01:00:13,950 --> 01:00:17,069
[Music]

999
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,079
so there's the grab and go so that's the

1000
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:22,160
grab and go code let me pull up some of

1001
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:29,839
the other ones here

1002
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:52,720
no idea all right it's fine all right

1003
01:00:54,839 --> 01:00:57,839
sketch

1004
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:03,440
basics blank

1005
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:10,960
there we go let's try this one

1006
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,680
and there's that blink sketch with the

1007
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,119
define added

1008
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:18,799
and then we change the number to eight

1009
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:24,400
and then we can change it to six

1010
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:27,680
and now we get the green going

1011
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,140
and

1012
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:34,290
[Music]

1013
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:39,839
and four to do a yellow hopefully maybe

1014
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,799
all right so i'm obviously going to have

1015
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:46,240
to do a little more troubleshooting on

1016
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,479
this

1017
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:53,520
on this to finish getting it working

1018
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,520
that's pretty much your homework if you

1019
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:56,720
want to

1020
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,240
if you're going to be using this for the

1021
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,240
main code tutorials tomorrow

1022
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,319
is just run that blank sketch make sure

1023
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:04,559
that all four

1024
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:09,359
or all seven excuse me leds light up

1025
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:12,079
there is another sample sketch that i

1026
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:14,860
will pull out and show you

1027
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:16,400
[Music]

1028
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:20,880
yep let's wiggle it

1029
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,559
yeah i'm going to cut these legs too

1030
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,079
well yeah we'll do one where other or

1031
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:33,200
not

1032
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:37,440
do this again when we're not going live

1033
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,880
so if we go back and look at the

1034
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:45,200
ide under sketch or under let's see what

1035
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:45,920
is it file

1036
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,839
there we go file examples

1037
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:56,799
see under digital we'll have a button

1038
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,839
and if we change this to

1039
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:07,200
10 where the button is

1040
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,960
and we change the led pin to

1041
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:16,079
8 because i like blue leds

1042
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:19,680
you now should just like on the

1043
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:25,038
on the uh tinkercad version

1044
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:30,640
run number eight should come on

1045
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,759
when you press the button

1046
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,359
okay so now i'm doing this again on

1047
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:45,839
the mac that's hooked up to the arduino

1048
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:02,640
and so all right

1049
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:09,520
oh the things we do for fun there we go

1050
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:12,799
wipe okay so now we've got

1051
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:16,880
the button yay the button works too

1052
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:21,119
all right so i'm

1053
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:23,440
going to continue to troubleshoot this

1054
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:24,839
um continue to ask

1055
01:04:24,839 --> 01:04:29,599
questions is there a lesser source

1056
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,079
can also double check the resistors are

1057
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:41,839
going to the correct location

1058
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,520
and is there a list resource we can

1059
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:45,680
refer to where the resistors leds and

1060
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:49,200
wires go on the breadboard

1061
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:55,119
i can definitely type something up for

1062
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:56,079
you

1063
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:58,319
um

1064
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:03,440
for you quick and um

1065
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,799
and share that um to be honest i kind of

1066
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:08,799
did this kind of freeform

1067
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:11,839
um so our resistors

1068
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:15,520
on this example um one side all goes to

1069
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,599
the negative rail

1070
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:22,079
and it looks like i've got them at 45

1071
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:25,520
40 35

1072
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:29,839
30 and on down

1073
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:36,960
and then yes and tully's got a picture

1074
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,559
and that's from that's actually from

1075
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:41,920
this one and they're similar

1076
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:51,839
and they're incredibly similar

1077
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:05,839
the first pin port id is

1078
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:06,880
see it should be

1079
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,680
[Music]

1080
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:12,078
did i

1081
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,880
see d2

1082
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:20,640
d2 d3 d4

1083
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:29,280
2 3 4 5 6

1084
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:34,640
7 8. on the pick

1085
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,880
looks like it starts on d7 instead of d8

1086
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,559
um

1087
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:47,839
well let's double check here

1088
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:05,839
and

1089
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,400
yeah it looks like this board might be a

1090
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:14,000
little off

1091
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,960
spin this around

1092
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:21,920
under the scope here where we can all

1093
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:25,119
see it yeah d3 d4 d5

1094
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:29,440
d6 d7 d8 and d9

1095
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:32,319
okay so i really meant to use d2 through

1096
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:33,359
d8

1097
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:35,760
apparently on my prototype i was off by

1098
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,119
one

1099
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,680
and if anybody followed those early

1100
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,119
pictures that i took

1101
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:45,520
of the original prototype version i'm

1102
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:57,839
sorry

1103
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:25,839
all right

1104
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:37,120
um it's not really the board is fine

1105
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,319
it's just that

1106
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:43,120
when i documented some of this stuff

1107
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:46,479
yeah d9 is empty it was it was supposed

1108
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:48,880
to be

1109
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:53,120
i've been doing it as d2 through d8

1110
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:55,600
or something i don't know somebody said

1111
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,120
one was off

1112
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,278
me

1113
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:06,880
yeah d2 through d8 apparently on my

1114
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:07,920
board it's

1115
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:11,359
d3 through d9

1116
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:13,839
which would explain some of the coding

1117
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:16,560
the weird coding errors i was seeing

1118
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,960
as when i was playing with the soldered

1119
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,839
board

1120
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:26,158
but that's why we build prototypes

1121
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:29,759
all right does anybody have any other

1122
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:34,319
questions want to take over the screen

1123
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:38,560
screened if they're having trouble

1124
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:44,640
it works yahoo thanks happy dance i'm

1125
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:49,839
glad to hear it jessica

1126
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:03,840
all right

1127
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,760
and then as long as we're here and we

1128
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,199
have a little time

1129
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:09,120
um just a little note when you go to

1130
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,360
power these things up

1131
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:16,080
you can let's go to the other screen

1132
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:20,400
you can use little usb power supplies

1133
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,880
um the trick with these is what i have

1134
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:23,920
found

1135
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:28,320
is that older cheaper less

1136
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:31,520
lower capacity ones with um

1137
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,880
under a thousand milliamps um

1138
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:38,000
work better than say that shiny new one

1139
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,760
you just bought that you can charge your

1140
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,679
phone four times before

1141
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:43,440
before you have to charge the adapter

1142
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,280
again

1143
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:49,040
so this one i think i picked up like at

1144
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:52,239
dollar tree or five below and see it

1145
01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:52,800
works

1146
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,600
just fine

1147
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:58,960
connected to power um you can use

1148
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:00,800
batteries you can use breadboard power

1149
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,320
supplies

1150
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:07,520
um rechargeable nine volts are good too

1151
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:11,040
um two especially if you just wanna you

1152
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:11,600
know

1153
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,840
have it you know i made the thing i want

1154
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:16,719
to put the thing on my desk for a while

1155
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:20,080
these are good and that's why we're

1156
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:22,719
going to set up the button

1157
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:24,159
that's why we'll set up our input

1158
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:27,920
buttons to only flash the lights

1159
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:41,840
when it's pressed

1160
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,600
so all right so who's also going to do

1161
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,360
the soldering project that's here right

1162
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,760
now

1163
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,800
i'm just kind of curious

1164
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:09,840
cool

1165
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:36,320
all right awesome

1166
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:51,840
excellent all right

1167
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:55,199
um i have seen that

1168
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,880
and what you want to do is you want to

1169
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:01,760
let it error out

1170
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:05,199
unplug it press the reset button

1171
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:07,120
and then press and hold the reset button

1172
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:10,239
while you plug it back in

1173
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:19,840
is usually what's happened

1174
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:33,840
all right

1175
01:13:34,430 --> 01:13:38,020
[Music]

1176
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:50,400
this all right and then yeah

1177
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:51,920
yeah don't worry about your soldering

1178
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,320
skills these are really

1179
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:56,400
pretty beginner friendly projects to

1180
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:57,760
begin with

1181
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,880
um and

1182
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:04,960
honestly i've had so much practice

1183
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:09,199
um practice and i even got

1184
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:12,800
more this year um this was

1185
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,800
this was my indie badge from this year

1186
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:15,920
um i'll

1187
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:17,679
i'll get some batteries later but each

1188
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:19,120
one has 46

1189
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,520
three millimeter leds and i built all of

1190
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:22,719
these

1191
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:25,920
that are on my attendee store by hand so

1192
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,760
you want to get

1193
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,880
a lot that's one way to get a lot of

1194
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,440
practice real fast

1195
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,199
i did not intend to build them by hand

1196
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:38,000
but pandemic

1197
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:44,000
is there a link to the tindy star

1198
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,640
um i can get you a link to the attendee

1199
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:47,199
store

1200
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:57,839
yes yes i can

1201
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,840
products

1202
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:25,839
sign in

1203
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:53,840
there you go

1204
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:14,000
so there's the link um i know that that

1205
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,480
we're giving away three

1206
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:19,920
and we've got codes for three free ones

1207
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:24,000
if you don't win one there are some left

1208
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:26,718
and yeah

1209
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,600
yeah and like ben said it's easy if you

1210
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,440
know technique it can be more of a

1211
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:39,040
challenge if you don't

1212
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:42,080
um probably the best advice i have for

1213
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:44,320
that

1214
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:49,840
is um to just start watching

1215
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,080
um youtube videos because a lot of

1216
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:52,960
different people

1217
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:56,159
approach it in different ways um

1218
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:58,000
and then you just find whichever

1219
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,480
technique works best for you

1220
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,840
like mark uses uses a board holder a

1221
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,280
third hand

1222
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:07,840
um i just go low to high right here on

1223
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:09,360
my silicon mat

1224
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:12,000
i don't usually use a lot of board hover

1225
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:12,719
bolt

1226
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:16,320
board holders or or clamps or vices or

1227
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:17,840
any of that stuff

1228
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,159
um

1229
01:17:21,290 --> 01:17:22,560
[Music]

1230
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,719
probably because you know the mindset of

1231
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:26,000
i can buy a kit

1232
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,280
or i can make a thing or or i can buy

1233
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,040
more tools

1234
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:35,120
i just learned how to do it against a

1235
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:45,840
workbench

1236
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,719
there's a goldilocks amount of

1237
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:01,520
everything

1238
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:06,000
there's a goldilocks amount of tinning

1239
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:13,840
there's a goldilocks amount of

1240
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,120
except for flux you can never have

1241
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:29,120
enough flux

1242
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:41,840
or you can never have too much flux

1243
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:52,080
yeah but is that through-hole or surface

1244
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:55,840
mount

1245
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,840
uh

1246
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:37,840
uh

1247
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:05,840
all right

1248
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:33,840
um

1249
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:47,839
all right

1250
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:52,608
[Music]

1251
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:58,410
[Music]

1252
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:01,840
uh

1253
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:14,639
oh my god

1254
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:29,840
all right

1255
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,679
all right and now that i've found some

1256
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:43,920
batteries

1257
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:47,120
for those of you are curious

1258
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:50,159
i think it's either this session or the

1259
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:51,760
next one

1260
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:53,520
where we're actually going to be

1261
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,600
raffling off

1262
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,239
this guy

1263
01:21:58,719 --> 01:22:04,320
and this is our 1978

1264
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,199
video game character made with 1978

1265
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:11,839
tech

1266
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:30,960
um these are

1267
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:39,040
well if you really want one unassembled

1268
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,960
i will be more than happy to send you

1269
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:44,239
one unassembled ben

1270
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,400
um we're giving away three of these

1271
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,560
there are a few left on tindy

1272
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:52,080
um tindy

1273
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:54,719
as far as the ics go um these are real

1274
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:55,520
basic

1275
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:58,639
um because like i said 1978 tech

1276
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:02,000
so this is a 555 timer um

1277
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,600
the way i have it configured it's

1278
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:06,080
sending out a square wave

1279
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:09,120
and then the longer ones

1280
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:12,480
are called decade counters and so

1281
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:13,679
basically it has

1282
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:15,760
ten pins zero through nine and it just

1283
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,600
steps through them based on the square

1284
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:18,560
wave

1285
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:22,480
and then we're actually controlling how

1286
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:25,920
the uh frequency of the square wave

1287
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,400
with these little knobs and so it goes

1288
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,320
all the way up

1289
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:35,840
different fast too slow
