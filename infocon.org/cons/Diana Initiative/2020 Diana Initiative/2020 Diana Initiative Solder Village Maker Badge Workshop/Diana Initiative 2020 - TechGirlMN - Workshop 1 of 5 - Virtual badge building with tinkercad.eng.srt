1
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,799
okay

2
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,480
well that was exciting

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,520
all right let's go over here

4
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,519
and turn that off and

5
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,079
all right

6
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,399
so there was a quick moment of panic

7
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,000
there um

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,760
hopping didn't like it anyway

9
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,280
so hi guys welcome um

10
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,920
this is our first build workshop this is

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,000
the one in tinkercad

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,320
is everybody about where i am in

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,120
tinkercad that is

14
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:13,840
that is they're open they're ready to go

15
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,799
okay so since this is recorded and we

16
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,000
only have an hour

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,799
i'm just going to oh hi mary yes okay

18
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,479
good

19
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,000
all right so i'm just gonna go ahead and

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,439
continue on

21
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,040
so if everybody's logged in we're going

22
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,560
to go ahead and create a new circuit

23
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,240
and then we wait

24
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,680
and then if everybody wants to come over

25
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,280
here on the right we have some

26
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,119
some starters we'll select arduino

27
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,119
and a lot of the work is going to be

28
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,040
done for us already if we just drag the

29
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,799
breadboard over

30
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,840
there it is

31
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,600
yay all right and

32
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,280
so now we're going to go back to our

33
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,240
basic components

34
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,440
and we'll wait and we'll wait

35
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,680
and just a quick note that if you don't

36
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,680
like what tinkercad picked for your

37
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,440
project

38
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,040
you can actually change it

39
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,840
if i could type

40
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,200
all right so let's place our resistors

41
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,720
first

42
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,599
and so we just drag one over and by

43
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,400
default

44
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,319
it's going to give you a 1k resistor

45
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,160
well that's a little much for our leds

46
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,760
so we're going to change this symbol to

47
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,239
just an

48
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,239
ohm and then we're going to change the

49
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,239
resistance to 220.

50
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,760
you'll see that the band's changed

51
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,440
to brown red red and that's good

52
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,480
and then before

53
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,159
we place these on the breadboard we're

54
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,879
going to ctrl c

55
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,720
ctrl v until we have

56
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,440
seven of them

57
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,360
six seven okay

58
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,800
and so what we want for our resistors

59
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,239
is we want the top leg

60
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,319
up here this is referred to as the

61
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,560
negative or ground rail and you can see

62
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,760
there's one on each side of the

63
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,959
breadboard

64
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,799
so let's just add these in on the top

65
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:47,840
evenly spaced

66
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,949
[Music]

67
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,120
grab the workbench not the resistor that

68
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,599
happens

69
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,280
all right

70
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,120
all right and then we'll just give it a

71
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,840
minute here make sure that everybody is

72
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:15,840
is at the same place

73
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,829
[Music]

74
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,600
all right

75
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,000
and just a couple other quick notes in

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,280
case you're not quite

77
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,880
just to make sure i give ever give

78
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,880
enough time for everybody to be done

79
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,639
um you can use your mouse wheel to zoom

80
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,040
in and zoom out

81
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,600
and if you write and if you click and

82
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,440
drag on any of the white space it's

83
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,800
going to move your project around

84
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,400
and if there's any other questions put

85
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,080
them in the chat and i will

86
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,120
try to answer them over the air

87
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,479
all right so hopefully everybody's got

88
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,400
all their resistors in place

89
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,479
if not i will make this public this

90
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,680
project public

91
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,800
so if you mess something up or

92
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,800
it's just something's not quite right

93
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,960
um this will be a public project so you

94
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,120
can come

95
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,039
i haven't done any wiring yet mary we

96
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,039
we're just on the resistors it's okay

97
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,560
um but anyway i am going to make this

98
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,160
project public so that if

99
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,600
so that if you don't quite get

100
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,199
everything done

101
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,080
done in time for tomorrow's major coding

102
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,160
session using tinkercad

103
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,880
you can use you can make a copy of this

104
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,000
project

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,600
so next we're going to do the same thing

106
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,320
for our leds

107
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,080
and we'll grab one two three

108
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,919
four five six

109
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:01,680
seven now let's see where's number one

110
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,319
okay so number one we're gonna leave red

111
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,199
and if i remember right we do it so we

112
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,319
want the

113
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,280
the bent leg

114
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,919
in the same column here as the resistor

115
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,240
and now the next two we're gonna

116
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,960
actually make

117
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,080
these yellow and let's make sure

118
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,199
we've got number two because if we don't

119
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,479
have number two

120
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:34,639
it's going to affect the code

121
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,960
two four three there we go and we'll

122
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,000
make this guy yellow

123
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,080
now let's find number four and make him

124
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,479
green

125
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,319
and number five should be green as well

126
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,880
and number six is blue

127
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,960
i came over and number

128
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,639
seven is blue

129
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,120
all right

130
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:31,840
and so we'll give it a minute here

131
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,880
just to make sure that everybody's

132
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,840
caught up

133
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,840
yes meadow i would love to answer your

134
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,840
question

135
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,639
um you know i've never tried it that way

136
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,879
but we could try it quick

137
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,159
so if i have two leds

138
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:37,760
and and no because there's no

139
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,080
yeah there's no way to select multiple

140
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,719
oh there we go

141
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,640
so not really you can select two things

142
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,120
and move them in a group but as far as

143
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,880
changing their attributes you have to do

144
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,200
that individually and that goes bye-bye

145
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,160
and that goes bye-bye

146
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,760
all right good question all right so now

147
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,720
we're going to wire this up

148
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,839
and so what we're gonna do and this is a

149
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,880
good practice for any arduino project

150
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,800
um on every board there's gonna be these

151
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,640
two pins zero and one and see how

152
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,200
they're marked

153
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,320
tx and rx

154
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,519
um and so those are the

155
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,360
so those are the same pins send and

156
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,160
receive that will work with the usb port

157
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,000
so if at all possible

158
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,839
we always want to leave these guys open

159
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,440
if you absolutely have to use them

160
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,680
that's that's okay you're going to need

161
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,440
to put the code on your board first and

162
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,000
then hook them up

163
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,120
so just a word of caution so that's why

164
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,880
with our red led we're going to start

165
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,959
and go from this pin here

166
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,320
and then we're going to make the wire

167
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,640
match

168
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,839
the setting or match the led

169
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,240
and then we're just going to continue on

170
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,200
two into two

171
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,760
yellow to yellow other yellow

172
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,360
two other yellow

173
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,320
and thankfully greens don't need changed

174
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,000
because hey

175
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,200
they're already that color

176
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:35,120
and there's our blues

177
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,079
and here's our other blue

178
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,600
all right so now we're down to one last

179
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,480
thing

180
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,920
we'll go ahead and give everybody a

181
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,680
minute or a moment

182
00:10:52,800 --> 00:11:01,839
or whatever to catch up

183
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,880
and looking at the chat here

184
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,279
yeah john that's smart we don't do smart

185
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,760
in the soldering village we we do

186
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,760
we do what we know because we're nervous

187
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,839
and

188
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,160
we're nervous and and have not has

189
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,680
consumed as much alcohol as we would

190
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,040
have had this been in vegas

191
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,480
all right so the final thing we need

192
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,680
here is a push button

193
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,440
and so there it is it's a push button

194
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,720
it goes clicky clicky now push buttons

195
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,079
on an arduino

196
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,800
um they're a little different they they

197
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,720
do require some additional hardware to

198
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,240
make them work right

199
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,600
so we're going to start by putting our

200
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,600
push button here at the end of the board

201
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,320
then we're going to take a wire and go

202
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,160
from here

203
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,760
and into the positive rail

204
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,639
and we're going to make that pink

205
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,920
because we already used red up here

206
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,279
and now we're going to take another

207
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,839
resistor

208
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,079
all right and this time we're just going

209
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,079
to add a 0 and make it a 10k

210
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,880
ohm resistor

211
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,439
and this goes into the negative rail

212
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,079
and now we have to get the button to

213
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,920
talk to the arduino

214
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,600
which leaves one last wire which is

215
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,040
going to come from way up here

216
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,880
and cross over everything

217
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,240
and what input did i put that in

218
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,240
that looks like

219
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,720
done okay it's in done

220
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,600
and then just to keep things organized

221
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,399
um so a quick note on the wires while

222
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,839
you guys get

223
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,200
well make sure everybody's finished up

224
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,360
here is that at some point if you really

225
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:17,920
want to

226
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,839
you can click and they will bend

227
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,719
if you need them to

228
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,560
honestly i don't

229
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,680
i don't think i need to feel the need to

230
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,519
feel that feel that fancy but

231
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,040
if you want to go ahead you can also

232
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,440
drag your wires or at least you used to

233
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,639
be able to apparently you can't anymore

234
00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:03,839
thank you for changes tinkercad

235
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,160
all right so now that we've got

236
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,120
everything hooked up

237
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,120
and as you can see it we're going to go

238
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,680
ahead and click start simulation

239
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,040
and the only thing that's going to

240
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,959
happen right now when you do that

241
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,000
is that this little guy's going to blink

242
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,800
arduinos come pre-programmed they're

243
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,000
going to be running a little

244
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,079
sketch um that's what they call the

245
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,920
firmware in the arduino world is it's a

246
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,959
sketch

247
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,800
um and so

248
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,440
and so the sketch that's loaded on to

249
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,600
the

250
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,600
let's load it on in the beginning is

251
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,519
this blink sketch

252
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,959
and it's just going to take the internal

253
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,519
led and go blink blink blink

254
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,720
well that's kind of boring

255
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,639
so we're going to go ahead and we're

256
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,079
going to play around

257
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,560
with the blocks because blocks are fun

258
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,440
so let's get everything tested here with

259
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,320
the blocks

260
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,320
um does anybody need any more build time

261
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,440
first

262
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,440
before we really get into the blocks and

263
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,120
and make sure that we've got everything

264
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:27,839
hooked up

265
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,440
[Music]

266
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,560
oh the ground on wire um

267
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,399
that was actually if you go up here to

268
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,600
components

269
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,320
and hit arduino starters we just dragged

270
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,839
one of these over

271
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:02,450
[Music]

272
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,560
um the first set of resistors are 220

273
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:23,839
ohm lisa

274
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,880
and then the

275
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,600
and then the resistor on the button is

276
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,839
10k

277
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,440
all right it sounds like lisa and mary

278
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,959
could use a few more minutes so we'll go

279
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,839
ahead and give them that

280
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,279
because

281
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,440
i horribly misjudged even with talking

282
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,120
about the things as i did them how long

283
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,560
this was going to take and scheduled

284
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,839
this for a full hour

285
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:05,839
so yay more time with the blocks

286
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,000
okay

287
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,280
right i'm going to initiate what's

288
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,960
called a ready check if you've ever

289
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,240
played world of warcraft or other multi

290
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,840
mmo or mmorpg so

291
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,000
if y'all could give me an r or ready in

292
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,039
the chat

293
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,840
we'll move on

294
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,840
so

295
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,840
all right so

296
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,360
and so right now we could have done this

297
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,480
up to here we could have done this

298
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,400
project with pretty much

299
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,880
anything what really makes this the

300
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,720
simulator obviously is the ability to

301
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,559
add code

302
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,080
now there's different there's

303
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,640
two different ways that that tinkercad

304
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,559
will handle code

305
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,840
they'll hand they have these

306
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,080
beginner-friendly blocks

307
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,679
and then we also have we can do blocks

308
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:52,559
and text

309
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,679
or straight text tomorrow's session will

310
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:56,240
be

311
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,039
the straight text that lines up with the

312
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,280
code that'll go on the physical boards

313
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,520
um

314
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,600
from the other two sessions but for

315
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,640
right now we're just gonna have some fun

316
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,400
and we're just going to use the blocks

317
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,840
because they're easy

318
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,960
and simple so if we take this

319
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,039
this is the built-in code for the

320
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,360
arduino and we're just going to go ahead

321
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,760
and get rid of all of that because

322
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,120
we don't need it we don't want it

323
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,520
it apparently doesn't want to go away

324
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,280
it's offended

325
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,400
how dare we throw away its original code

326
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,400
there we go all right

327
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,000
so much like you'll see tomorrow with

328
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,919
the actual text

329
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,640
um we're going to use these codes these

330
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,919
blocks here

331
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,280
and we can set these now by pin

332
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,678
so if we take set pin 2 to high

333
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,200
and start simulation

334
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,679
that turned on and it turned it blinked

335
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,880
and went off why did that

336
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,840
interesting

337
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,600
so now

338
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,480
let's try that so we've taken

339
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,120
the red wire and said hey turn on for a

340
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,080
second

341
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,919
and then turn off turn on wait a second

342
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,200
turn off

343
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,520
and then because they're very verbose we

344
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,240
need to have it off for a second as well

345
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,840
and now hopefully

346
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,720
yeah it blinked it blinked and stopped

347
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,320
all right

348
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,360
where do i have these back

349
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,520
okay

350
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,640
all right so that's that and you can

351
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,640
go ahead and be as crazy as you like

352
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,159
with these

353
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,520
we can actually go back and

354
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,120
turn a couple more on here too

355
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,320
so let's add a yellow one should be

356
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:26,720
about

357
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,159
pin four and

358
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:35,840
we'll add a blue one on pin 8

359
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,520
and then we'll snag some more down here

360
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,320
oops and i grabbed their own block

361
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,720
and so if you need to get rid of

362
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,440
something

363
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:59,200
just pull it apart kind of like legos

364
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,120
you know i think they are ah

365
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,080
very good

366
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,679
okay so i messed up because i'm nervous

367
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:12,240
and

368
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,080
haven't i haven't actually haven't um

369
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,000
done any really new projects where i

370
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
needed or i felt the need to simulate it

371
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,280
out first

372
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,679
so i do believe he's right let's take a

373
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:24,320
look

374
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,840
so if we move that over

375
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,640
and we'll set these to two

376
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,320
and we'll set this one to

377
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,840
eight

378
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,199
no i was right before

379
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,440
weird okay so my tinkercads being a

380
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,000
little weird

381
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,520
sorry about that i did test this but

382
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,120
unfortunately i test this tested it

383
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,039
on my mac probably a week ago

384
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,919
and that's always the trouble with with

385
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,039
online tools is

386
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,559
that they can make little changes and

387
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,799
not

388
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,679
tell you about them and now it's working

389
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:22,559
who knew weird

390
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,520
oh yeah

391
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:37,840
oh good god

392
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:44,879
well i am totally off here

393
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,840
okay

394
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,559
fascinating okay

395
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,039
so yes

396
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,360
so i did actually screw these up and i'm

397
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,840
going to fix them here quick

398
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,279
you should have been on the ground rail

399
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,120
not the positive rail and that's why

400
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,919
we're having trouble

401
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,120
and that's why i'm having trouble with

402
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,039
the code hopefully you listen to my

403
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,480
words and not follow the screen

404
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,840
come on

405
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,640
all right let's try this again

406
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,799
and

407
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,840
oh don't start with me

408
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,559
i love live demos i really do

409
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,840
alright so let's move this over

410
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,480
[Laughter]

411
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:15,440
the demo gods are not being kind to me

412
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,760
and so we're just going to move these

413
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,480
over one

414
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,400
because apparently yes my

415
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,559
stop it go wait

416
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,360
sorry about this guys i yeah it's

417
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,440
i don't have a lot of practice streaming

418
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,039
and

419
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,679
i'm much funnier in person just saying

420
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,240
all right stop that

421
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,279
yes oh come on

422
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,919
fine bye all right now that we have this

423
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,840
wire selected we can actually move it

424
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,600
yay

425
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,000
all right

426
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:21,600
[Laughter]

427
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,279
no i'll be done here in a minute and

428
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,960
we've still got another half hour

429
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,360
so yeah

430
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,919
i do apologize for this it did not help

431
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,039
that there was

432
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,760
thunder and lightning and i've been up

433
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,880
since about 5

434
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,880
30 my time and it's now 11 a.m my time

435
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,840
so yay

436
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:07,840
all right so we're almost fixed here

437
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,240
because apparently in between my

438
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,840
sessions i'm going to have to run to a

439
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,399
starbucks

440
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,799
all right

441
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,799
there we go now let's start that again

442
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,399
oh look yay

443
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,520
yes but see i live in southern canada

444
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,679
aka minnesota we apologize for

445
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,240
everything

446
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,960
okay so now that we've troubleshot

447
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,840
shot my circuit and determined that yes

448
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,399
i need more coffee

449
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,239
we can play with the box some more

450
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,320
okay so we've got two two four and eight

451
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,200
set on high we're waiting in a second

452
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,480
and 2 and 8 are going

453
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,919
low why is stop it

454
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,840
and so these are the blocks

455
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,000
and so you can actually get that working

456
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,760
yay let's set

457
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,799
and we'll drop four into low as well

458
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,320
so now they all go blinky blank

459
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,720
so woohoo now we're going to go ahead

460
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,840
and we're going to trash

461
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,639
these blocks

462
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,840
and we're going to work on and we're

463
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,320
going to

464
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:59,279
show you the button block here

465
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,600
maybe

466
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,158
all right

467
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,840
so

468
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:41,840
oh if i look for what we need here

469
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,840
all right

470
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:05,429
[Music]

471
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,039
i think i've got all my bits here

472
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,960
so to use a button or any kind of input

473
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,840
on an arduino we need to make the code

474
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,440
ask a question so

475
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,360
if the thing happens then what

476
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,399
so to do that we need a math block and

477
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:33,600
so we're going to say to read the

478
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,480
digital pin

479
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,279
and our digital pin for this exercise is

480
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,840
number 10

481
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,279
and

482
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,919
if it's high if it's on or pressed it'll

483
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,600
do something if it's lower not pressed

484
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,320
and that may be backwards

485
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,640
like i said under caffeinated we'll fix

486
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,000
that for the next session

487
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,279
and then we stick that in there

488
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,399
and we've got basically an if statement

489
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:09,279
same as in a regular code so then we

490
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,039
need to make sure

491
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,120
that if it does something so let's turn

492
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,360
on our friendly blue led

493
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,760
it seems to like me better i don't know

494
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,840
why

495
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,039
we pop that in there and hit here

496
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,840
and there's our button

497
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,879
and then we'll follow that up with

498
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,200
and then we're going to make it a little

499
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,080
more complex

500
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,679
because it read it it said it was high i

501
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,519
turned the light on but we want it to do

502
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,720
both

503
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,240
so we're going to move our little math

504
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,360
block to here

505
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,720
we're going to grab high to there

506
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,760
and then we'll take this one

507
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,518
and set it to low

508
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,159
and we'll trash this standard if

509
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,640
statements

510
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,000
why why are you doing this

511
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,440
and so now the led only lights up when

512
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,760
we click on the button

513
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,080
yay

514
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,320
all right anybody have any questions or

515
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,720
comments or

516
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,600
anything else

517
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,880
um let's see i know they are all being

518
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,320
recorded

519
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,559
um i think they're gonna pop the

520
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,080
recording into the

521
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,840
into the sessions as pre-recorded

522
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,360
sessions

523
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,120
um i know i have i have said that i will

524
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,679
have

525
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,600
that my sessions because every session

526
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,200
for hop in is being recorded

527
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,039
that yes it was okay to make my sessions

528
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,399
public

529
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:21,279
um so to be honest i'm not 100 sure

530
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,840
because

531
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,480
oh it's okay mary we've got

532
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,600
it's okay you've got time there's always

533
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,279
the homework

534
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,880
um is there anything we need to know if

535
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,600
we're doing the soldering version

536
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,320
the soldering version is pretty much

537
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,200
going to run

538
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,840
the same way

539
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,840
way we'll be doing these things in the

540
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,720
same order

541
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,159
um there's nothing that's covered in

542
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:56,640
here

543
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,720
other than you know showing you the

544
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,600
basics of the blocks of how to

545
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,640
the basics of the blocks um that's in

546
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,000
the soldering version

547
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,960
um i can't really think of anything

548
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,719
offhand

549
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,000
um just make sure you have your

550
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,320
equipment and ready to go

551
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,918
um why yes ben i know you know this

552
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,359
answer and

553
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,839
and are

554
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,879
anyway so ben asked if to care to

555
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,480
explain the difference between a current

556
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,960
limiting resistor for the leds

557
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,879
versus the pull-up pull-down resistors

558
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,879
used on the switches

559
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,480
so i did kind of gloss over that um

560
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,879
so basically we have two out we have the

561
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,239
two leds on this

562
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,800
circuit are doing two different things

563
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,359
the

564
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:46,879
top circuit the ones here um

565
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,560
here are limiting the amount of current

566
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,960
that can go into the led

567
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,679
so for example um most of these leds run

568
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:03,839
between 2 2.2 and 3 volts

569
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,960
and

570
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,440
and the output here here on an uno

571
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,320
is five if i remember correctly so we

572
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,560
need to basically cut that down so that

573
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,760
we don't burn out our led

574
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,320
whereas here these little switches can

575
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,400
be kind of noisy

576
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,960
and so this is actually a pull up

577
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,800
resistor so that when there's so that

578
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,599
when this

579
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,320
so that when the switch is open it

580
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,599
there's no noise

581
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,280
going back to pin 10 triggering a false

582
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,880
press and

583
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,920
then john asked if i run the simulation

584
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,320
the red turns on the whole time is that

585
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,960
because it is in line with the switch

586
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,720
yes yes it is so let's move

587
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,560
that part of the circuit over

588
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,400
as soon as we stop the simulation so

589
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,240
we'll just bump this one guy over

590
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,200
bump this one over and if we bump this

591
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,760
one over

592
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,800
and hit start

593
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,000
now we just get the blue light

594
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,800
all right who else has questions

595
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:27,839
comments concerns

596
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:41,839
so

597
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,839
all right

598
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,920
and the neat thing about this is that we

599
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,040
can stick with the blocks

600
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,599
it will actually if i remember to do

601
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:16,240
this

602
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,439
that's right stop there we go

603
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:24,960
it will actually convert your blocks to

604
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:31,680
code so everything that we did

605
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,760
as far as saying hey we need pin

606
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,960
pin 8 the blue led as output

607
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,160
pin mode 10 10 is our button it's set to

608
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,599
input

609
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:46,480
this is the infinite loop of an arduino

610
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,920
sketch

611
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,920
so it's saying that if pin 10 is high

612
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,599
then turn on the blue led which is on

613
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:56,640
pin 8

614
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,920
otherwise leave it off and then it

615
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,760
and it's even kind enough to add the

616
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,599
little bit of debuffing we need to make

617
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,839
sure

618
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,240
it's improving the simulation

619
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,880
performance it's also a good practice

620
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,880
in real code just so that it stays

621
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,839
either high or low the whole time

622
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,240
and you do want to be careful because if

623
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,760
you go to

624
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,359
straight text it will not let you edit

625
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:28,640
your blocks anymore

626
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,839
they'll be gone

627
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,359
and another fun feature is that on the

628
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,000
simulator

629
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,040
the serial monitor works and if you're

630
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,760
taking some of the other sessions

631
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,720
um one of the things that is handy about

632
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,400
an arduino is that we can set up the

633
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,599
serial monitor

634
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,160
so at different points during the during

635
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,359
your sketch

636
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,200
if you want to check that it's reached

637
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,280
that point you can print something

638
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,839
to the serial monitor if you're using a

639
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,760
sensor and want to see the data but

640
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,040
maybe not have

641
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,320
an led or a motor or whatever react you

642
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,040
can

643
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,040
you can show that it's triggered with

644
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,440
the serial monitor

645
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,560
and so we're gonna trigger our serial

646
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,079
monitor with just hello world

647
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:29,030
every time the button's pressed

648
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:31,520
[Music]

649
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,440
and you can see multiples because it's

650
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,119
going through

651
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,400
as it goes through the loop the button

652
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,880
is going

653
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,240
faster or the loop is going faster than

654
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,520
the actual button

655
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,680
so you might so even in real life you

656
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,680
might see more than one

657
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,480
hello world

658
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,640
so let's see all right so there is about

659
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,760
20 minutes left in this session

660
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,079
um does anybody have any questions

661
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,760
comments

662
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,880
other thing other

663
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,359
pieces or parts bits that you might want

664
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,359
to see virtually before you try using

665
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:25,839
them in real life

666
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,240
yeah i will admit that that um

667
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,119
for some projects um i actually still

668
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,200
like to start here

669
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,640
um because i can kind of get my idea

670
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,240
out of my head very quickly um

671
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,880
so yeah this is kind of a really nice

672
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,040
free tool from

673
00:40:51,040 --> 00:41:07,839
from autodesk

674
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:21,839
right

675
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,319
okay kelly and i'm going to read your

676
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:27,359
question because

677
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,599
recording could you go over the basic

678
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,000
rules of how to build these circuits

679
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,160
and maybe where to go to learn more

680
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,520
thanks

681
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,560
okay um

682
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,760
so it's kind of the same question um two

683
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,960
different ways

684
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,560
um probably the best place to go

685
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,240
they

686
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:55,019
[Music]

687
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,960
so probably the best place to start is

688
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,839
actually

689
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,720
the arduino home page

690
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,319
and they do have

691
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,440
you can code online with the wet upper

692
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,960
they've got all the different things

693
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,919
libraries course troubleshooting

694
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,960
you know they've got lots and lots of

695
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,839
tutorials on getting started

696
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,880
another good place to go i find

697
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,520
um is one youtube just

698
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,560
start searching um

699
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,760
and two i learned a lot of my um basic

700
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,760
stuff

701
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,480
i went and bought a kit like an arduino

702
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:54,880
kit

703
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,440
where it had the arduino and it had some

704
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,000
leds

705
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,720
and resistors and diodes and a couple of

706
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,400
little tiny servos

707
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,480
and then it had a nice little booklet

708
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,680
that kind of explained the the basics

709
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,400
um i don't remember i think

710
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,200
spark fun

711
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,599
still throws out some good tutorials as

712
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,160
well here

713
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:29,520
so let's see shop learn

714
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,760
so sparkfun has lots and lots of

715
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,599
tutorials

716
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,680
um another good place to go get

717
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,720
tutorials

718
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:41,839
is at a

719
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,560
industries yay

720
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,279
thank you google

721
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,000
and so they also have a good learning

722
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,480
section

723
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,760
um pretty much if i can't remember how

724
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,880
to do something i go to adafruit because

725
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,800
she has she will probably have

726
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,359
a guide for it and she's got some really

727
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:10,960
good guides

728
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,880
as well um

729
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,800
especially when we get especially if you

730
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,839
get more

731
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,880
into the more advanced programming she's

732
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,560
got a really good two parts

733
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,078
thing on multitasking

734
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,680
i mentioned homework okay

735
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:38,720
homework is to make sure that this guy

736
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,439
matches up

737
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,920
that your version of this board matches

738
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,720
up otherwise i will be able to

739
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:51,440
i can hit the share button here

740
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,640
otherwise i can share it for later so

741
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,960
really that's your homework is to

742
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,480
make sure you're done you've got

743
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,000
everything set up

744
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,839
and to try the blocks

745
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,440
and so i'm just going to put these links

746
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:19,839
here in the

747
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,640
in the chat if so if you want to check

748
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:33,839
them out

749
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:47,760
okay

750
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,079
so yeah no for homework i expect you all

751
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,599
to go to

752
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:57,119
arduino dot cc slash ing

753
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,280
slash tutorial slash foundations and

754
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,480
read all of the links

755
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,160
no i'm kidding i'm kidding

756
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,960
all right anybody got any other

757
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,000
questions comments or

758
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,520
concerns did i share my project um

759
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,280
what i have to do is i have to go back

760
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,839
out i remember how to do this right

761
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:29,839
and

762
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,599
see where is that setting

763
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,960
private tinker this

764
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,280
comment oh where is it

765
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,040
cancel that's not what we wanted

766
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,760
there is a setting that makes this

767
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,440
public

768
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,240
and let's try the gear sign name ah

769
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,599
there we go privacy

770
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,000
public safe changes

771
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:06,240
there so now you can look at mine you

772
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:06,800
can

773
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,160
just copy mine

774
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,920
to your own account however you want to

775
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:25,839
do it

776
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,480
you like that one

777
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:52,640
all right and let's

778
00:47:52,640 --> 00:48:06,720
hop back

779
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:21,839
all right

780
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,319
all right so

781
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:39,680
there's about 10 minutes left in the

782
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,079
session so last call for questions

783
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:49,839
comments concerns

784
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:03,839
well thank you for attending mary

785
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,480
the wiring is now correct for the

786
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,520
for the red led um

787
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,440
that was my bad when we moved it over we

788
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,440
started sharing with the

789
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,440
the switch which is was why it was on

790
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:30,400
all the time

791
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,079
and just like in real life you're always

792
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:33,520
a little nervous first session of the

793
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:45,839
day and i didn't catch it

794
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,480
oh it does it does thank you meadow

795
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:59,839
ah get over there there we go

796
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:27,839
uh

797
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,640
alrighty then i

798
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,000
um don't forget to sign up for the

799
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,760
raffle

800
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,000
i think if you attended this session you

801
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,839
were in a drawing for a beach towel

802
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:51,119
towel remember that there are two more

803
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:53,440
two more physical sessions today and

804
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,119
then we will be exploring

805
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:59,920
the the proper code based

806
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,520
the proper text code based programming

807
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,079
tomorrow

808
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,200
