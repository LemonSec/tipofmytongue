1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,920
good morning everyone

2
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,320
and just let me get rid of some stuff

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,880
here because you know no crew

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,560
all right all right and we'll get this

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,119
moved

6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,680
out of the way

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,119
all right so good morning is everybody

8
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,920
logged in and ready to have some fun

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,880
type some code

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,600
learn learn a thing maybe or not you

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:33,920
know

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,320
up to you

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,640
all right so this is our basic uh

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,120
badge from yesterday and

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,800
if you don't have one there is a link in

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,879
the chat

17
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,239
chat um to just

18
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,559
go ahead and it's a public project you

19
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:55,440
can make you can

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,760
log in clone a copy and you're good to

21
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,839
go

22
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,000
and thank you for once again doing the

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,640
link

24
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,200
okay so we're built so let's bring up

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,080
our code window

26
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,960
and if you remember yesterday move this

27
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,200
a little bit yeah there we

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,600
and go this over here

29
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,360
kind of looking at the desktop capture

30
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,840
window okay there

31
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,200
i want to make sure that we have plenty

32
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,320
of room to see what we're doing

33
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,880
all right as you remember we kind of um

34
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,240
played with it a little bit

35
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,360
using these these blocks um

36
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,880
feel free to play with the blocks some

37
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,720
more

38
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,560
but today we're actually going to go

39
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,840
ahead

40
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,000
and write some actual

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,520
code to go with our badge

42
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,920
so tinkercad is nice in the way that it

43
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,878
actually goes ahead and any blocks that

44
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:09,440
we had

45
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,480
it will automatically convert

46
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,280
to code

47
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,800
but for this example

48
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,920
and what we're going to be working on um

49
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,599
we don't have everything we need so

50
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,800
let's start working on that first

51
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,160
so first let's go through what's

52
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,080
happening here right now we have what's

53
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,400
called

54
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,599
void setup this code will run once at

55
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,480
the beginning

56
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,200
it's what you use to turn things on and

57
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,000
designate how things are going to work

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,360
so the first one of those that we have

59
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,360
is is pin mode

60
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,599
and it's referring to number 10 is

61
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,280
referring to the 10th pin

62
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,360
where we have have our button

63
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,080
and we're gonna designate that as input

64
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,680
when we press it we want something to

65
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,000
happen

66
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,040
the next one we have already imported

67
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,080
from our blocks

68
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,200
is pin mode number eight output that was

69
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,159
our

70
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,239
led that we had blinking at the end

71
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,640
and let's undo that

72
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,159
poolsy all right

73
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,599
things got stretched weird but i think

74
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,560
we're still okay

75
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,080
um so going back pin mode number eight

76
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,879
output

77
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,200
that meant that the blue light on number

78
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,879
eight was blinking

79
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,280
or was actually i'm sorry read the code

80
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,640
it was actually turn on

81
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,079
when we hit the thing and

82
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,120
stupid mouse all right and then finally

83
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,599
for setup we had serial begin

84
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,560
9600 and what that is is that when you

85
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,280
are

86
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,040
working with an arduino project and you

87
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,519
have it plugged into your computer

88
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,799
it can send back either data or it can

89
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:57,360
send back

90
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,080
a graph if you've got a sensor hooked up

91
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,680
but we need to

92
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,920
say hey turn on the turn on the serial

93
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,840
monitor before we

94
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,680
when the sketch first runs and we turn

95
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,280
it on

96
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,480
so all of the action that we want

97
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,280
arduino to perform is going to be in

98
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,160
this main

99
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,680
loop void loop that's a that's a c

100
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,720
and all of this is based on on uh i

101
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,680
think it's either c

102
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,040
or c plus plus it's a variant of c

103
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,280
so you're going to see those conventions

104
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,880
the semicolons

105
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,040
the curly brackets the parentheses

106
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,199
the double equal signs all those good

107
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,479
things so

108
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,880
in our original in our original uh

109
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,440
example from the blocks we had a simple

110
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,639
if statement

111
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,000
if this is happening do this if not

112
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,880
do something else

113
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,680
and then the other thing that we've got

114
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,759
going on here is delay which is

115
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,199
basically a timer

116
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,400
wait 10 milliseconds

117
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,400
so if we break this down again what

118
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,000
we're saying that is if

119
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,520
digital read which is our button on

120
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,840
on pin 10 equals hi which is pressed

121
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,880
then we write then we tell

122
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,759
the led on pin 8 to turn on we also take

123
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,080
our serial

124
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,720
connection and print hello world

125
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,960
otherwise

126
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,680
the lights off and we don't do anything

127
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,440
and just as a refresher

128
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,240
we'll we'll simulate this for a second

129
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,000
so yeah if you click the button

130
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,160
light turns on no button light goes off

131
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,039
and if we look at our serial monitor

132
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,160
every time it hit

133
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,280
this line in the loop it printed out

134
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,240
another hello world

135
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,080
so we're going to build on this

136
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,720
this and what we're going to do is we're

137
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,440
going to say

138
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,199
we're going to have the lights go in one

139
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,160
direction one after the other

140
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,440
unless you press the button in which

141
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,800
case they're going to go in the opposite

142
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,360
direction

143
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,280
so we're going to need to add some

144
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,960
things first we're going to have to make

145
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,680
sure that

146
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,199
all of our leds

147
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,199
light up so we're going to go back to

148
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,639
void setup

149
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,360
and i'm kind of a lazy programmer if

150
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,880
there's a line where i only need to

151
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,440
change

152
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,479
one little thing

153
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,600
maybe once again

154
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,759
oh stop the simulation and you can edit

155
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,160
the code

156
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,360
all right so i'm kind of a lazy

157
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,600
programmer so instead of

158
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,319
going through and typing this out you

159
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,639
can if you want

160
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,440
not going to judge

161
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,400
seven oops six

162
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,840
maybe if i can type this morning

163
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,840
four three

164
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,318
and two

165
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,240
and we got nothing on pin nine and then

166
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,599
the serial we're going to leave and the

167
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,720
output stays the same

168
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,919
same and i'll post it later today

169
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,680
probably to my own blog because that's

170
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,360
easier for me to edit

171
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,000
but i will have a link to this project

172
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,880
um

173
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,520
and the online arduino editor because

174
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,400
it's easier to share projects there

175
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,280
um there and then i will have this code

176
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,160
for you to

177
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,960
to load onto an actual physical board if

178
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,319
you'd like

179
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,879
okay so now that we've got everything

180
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,639
we've told the arduino that yes

181
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,080
we want to use all of these pins

182
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,080
pins and the serial monitor we're going

183
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,800
to go to our code

184
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,400
so we're going to get rid of everything

185
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,160
between these two curly brackets because

186
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,039
this particular loop that will scroll on

187
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,879
forever and i'm using hand gestures and

188
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,919
you can't see me

189
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,520
sorry this little loop

190
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,160
that will go forever has to be between

191
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,440
these two curly brackets

192
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,400
so let's start

193
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,479
with with our first little code block

194
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,479
and i am going to actually type this one

195
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,639
in

196
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,760
and so to start with our first code

197
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,279
block i'm sorry i forgot a couple of

198
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:35,760
things

199
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,760
we need some global variables to be able

200
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,200
to do this and so i'm going to make

201
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,599
three new global variables these are

202
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,440
these are things that we want to

203
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,000
declare that these that that these

204
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,720
characters

205
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,320
mean this and they always mean this

206
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,320
whatever we're referring to them we can

207
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,519
change them because they're not

208
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,720
constants

209
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,320
but we need to have a starting point for

210
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,600
these things so we're going to call the

211
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,240
first one

212
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,720
active led

213
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
and we're going to by default set that

214
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,360
to 2

215
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,680
which is the number which is the number

216
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,839
of the red led

217
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,320
then because we're going to be doing

218
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:16,880
some

219
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,600
trickery i'm not good with variable

220
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,519
names

221
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,560
give enough we're gonna call this one

222
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,760
active led

223
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,720
to not real descriptive we could say one

224
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,320
we could say zero

225
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,160
just something to keep it different from

226
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,240
the first active led

227
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,240
we're gonna set this one to 8 which

228
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,360
corresponds to

229
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,200
of course the last led in our set

230
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,760
blue one

231
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,720
and then finally we need to

232
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,640
make sure that i got rid of it

233
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,600
that we have the what the button's doing

234
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,720
because we need to know what

235
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:05,839
it's doing so that we can trigger on it

236
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,760
so we'll go button and maybe i can spell

237
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,720
today maybe i'm not

238
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,120
button eight

239
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,640
and we'll declare that as zero

240
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,600
so we've got our new global variables

241
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,640
we've got our setup

242
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,800
so now let's start with this first bit

243
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,359
of code

244
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,200
which see

245
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,000
where did i have that

246
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,560
sorry i've got i've actually got this

247
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,320
code finished and printed out

248
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,920
and i apparently should have drawn on it

249
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,680
a little more before i

250
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,959
started teaching okay there we go

251
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,360
okay so let's start with d-i-d-i-d-o

252
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,760
right

253
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,839
okay

254
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,040
so digital write is actually kind of

255
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,120
like a it's a

256
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,720
it's a built-in function or

257
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,640
or object because c is object oriented

258
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,279
it's actually built in it's a built-in

259
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:41,760
one

260
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,279
so we can just call it we don't have to

261
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,519
declare it we don't have to

262
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,920
have to define it it already knows how

263
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,680
to deal with this particular function

264
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,399
and that's what

265
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,240
turns the leds on or off um

266
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,560
and it takes two what are called

267
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,480
arguments it needs two little pieces of

268
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,000
information to work

269
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,079
it needs to know what pin to turn on

270
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,360
turn on or off

271
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,800
and if it's going to turn it on or off

272
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,079
so we're going to start with digital

273
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,200
write and then our

274
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:25,839
active led

275
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,040
there you go and then

276
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,279
we separate the two pieces of data with

277
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,680
a comma

278
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,639
and then we want to tell it to go high

279
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,480
and yes case and all that good stuff

280
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,320
matters

281
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,440
and we'll close that with

282
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,639
and we'll close and we'll note the end

283
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,480
of the statement with a semicolon

284
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,839
so now if we hit start simulation

285
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,240
the red led turned on yay stop

286
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,079
and so if we change this number it is

287
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,839
going to change

288
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:07,360
which led pops up

289
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,200
but that is in and of itself kind of

290
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,079
boring so let's add a little bit of

291
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,760
action to this

292
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,680
so we want to wait and kuwait we use

293
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,320
the term delay that's another built-in

294
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,560
function

295
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,880
of

296
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,120
of the code so let's go two five

297
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,839
oh which is a quarter of a second

298
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,560
second so the delay takes a value in

299
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,519
milliseconds

300
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,279
so a thousand would be a second

301
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,720
second uh 10 000 would be 10 seconds

302
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,360
etcetera etcetera

303
00:13:51,360 --> 00:14:02,480
and then we're going to add in another

304
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,800
right

305
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,680
led

306
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,839
whoa

307
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,360
and then if we add in a yet another

308
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,839
delay

309
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,519
and now if we run this

310
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,680
we find that the led yes it blinks

311
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,040
it's going high waiting turning off

312
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,199
waiting and we've got a blinky light

313
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,320
all right so we'll hit stop so that we

314
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,839
can edit our code

315
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,560
and now because we have a variable

316
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,320
instead of a pin number

317
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,519
we can do a little math on it

318
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,360
and make it do something else

319
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,959
and so we can make the variable change

320
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,360
so let's add in the little math piece

321
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,160
and we're going to say

322
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,639
active

323
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,279
led which is which right now is set to

324
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,600
four

325
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,959
equals

326
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,000
active led

327
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,360
plus one um if you've coded

328
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,720
um let me see if i can zoom in here a

329
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,759
little

330
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,120
on the chrome window and see if that

331
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,839
helps any

332
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,000
did that help everybody does the type

333
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,440
does the text need to be bigger because

334
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,120
we can

335
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,639
because as long as we can see this part

336
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,839
of the breadboard we're good

337
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,880
yup

338
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,319
okay let's go up one more then

339
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,880
wow and let's move this

340
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,839
back

341
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,240
yeah i changed it for the demo we'll

342
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,680
change it back here thanks for the

343
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,839
reminder

344
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,198
so now if we watch this

345
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,280
and we'll also take a look at what's

346
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:19,839
happening in the serial monitor

347
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,039
s e r i

348
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:33,200
a lot

349
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,400
t and for a new line

350
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,679
and we got a big old typo

351
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,640
let's try that again serial print line

352
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,520
and what do we want to print we want to

353
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,200
print x

354
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,559
if led

355
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,840
and that statement okay so now we've got

356
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,440
it going

357
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,120
so now it'll start on 2 wait turn 2 off

358
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,000
it'll take the active led variable and

359
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,280
add 1 to it

360
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,600
so it'll now be 3 and that's going to go

361
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,320
through this loop again

362
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,840
and so if you start the simulation

363
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,360
whoops

364
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,480
uh okay

365
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:29,840
and i have a typo expected

366
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,240
last line oh yes thank you meadow

367
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,559
[Laughter]

368
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,559
oh the joys of having to do things alive

369
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,840
now

370
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,600
let's try this again expected

371
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,880
a close-up serial print

372
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,760
okay fine

373
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,760
let's put everything in the right place

374
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,679
okay so now as you see it goes through

375
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,919
and we've debugged it it went through

376
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,120
all of the leds one by one

377
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,280
and then it stopped so if we go with the

378
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,799
serial monitor

379
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,840
we can see that it's continuing to go up

380
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,919
and up and up past our pins

381
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:39,360
so we need to fix that

382
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,120
all right so to fix that we're going to

383
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,960
use what's called an if statement

384
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,360
the good old if this happens do that

385
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,640
so we're going to limit how high

386
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,760
our expression of adding 1 to the active

387
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,720
led

388
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,880
on line 26 is so we're going to go if

389
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:07,679
active led

390
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,159
is greater than or equal to

391
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,120
9 and you always need to go one above

392
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,918
your last pin

393
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,559
so that it'll so to uh

394
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,400
make sure you get the last pin in the in

395
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,400
the sequence

396
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,240
and then we're gonna add these lovely

397
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,720
curly brackets

398
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,320
because we need a little code that's

399
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,159
only active if we're using this

400
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,240
the if statement and that'll brace it up

401
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,520
and so we're going to set reset our

402
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,840
active led back to 2.

403
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,039
and we're actually going to go down

404
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,840
so you can see a little better okay so

405
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,520
now we've got it going on

406
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,360
going off adding one to move to the next

407
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,120
we'll get to see what number active led

408
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,799
it currently is

409
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,039
if the number is greater than 9 we're

410
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,799
going to reset it to 2

411
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,919
and add the semicolon here so that we

412
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,120
don't get another

413
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,840
syntax error because those are fun

414
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,280
especially during a live demo

415
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,640
and so now when you do it it goes all

416
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,000
the way to the end and starts over and

417
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,520
if we watch our serial monitor

418
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:45,840
it's doing the thing

419
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,000
okay jay is it doing anything at all is

420
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,159
it

421
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,480
nope and you use and you clicks

422
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,480
okay all right so let's

423
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,080
so let's go ahead we've got a little

424
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:12,960
time um

425
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,440
all right

426
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,440
huh

427
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:41,840
this isn't pretty good

428
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,720
so you didn't put in the if statement

429
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,200
and it wasn't doing anything before

430
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,520
okay

431
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,600
um go ahead and just drop the

432
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,679
the loop to that first digital write

433
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:09,840
statement does that light up

434
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,840
so

435
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:37,840
no okay

436
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,840
yes

437
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,760
okay

438
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,960
all right so

439
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,480
we're going to continue on here

440
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,760
here so this is good it's interesting it

441
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,600
does something it would work for

442
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,199
you know display a pumpkin

443
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,000
why does it work why doesn't it work if

444
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,120
i just say active

445
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,959
led equal to 9 then

446
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,360
because it is possible

447
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,880
somehow to get to 10 10 a glitch in the

448
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,000
code whatever

449
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:15,840
um it's just kind of a convention

450
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,640
convention i've always done it that way

451
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,440
and

452
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,440
i'm sure that i probably asked the same

453
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,200
question of one of my programming

454
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,039
instructors once upon a time

455
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,039
and i can't remember the answer

456
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,320
hopefully one of our volunteer

457
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,200
moderators has a better one for you

458
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,760
okay mary thank you all right

459
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,640
so this is good

460
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,960
good if we were doing like a halloween

461
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,520
decoration or something

462
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,559
something um

463
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,200
something this would be perfectly fine

464
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
you know have your little ghosts

465
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,120
light up along the walk one after the

466
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,760
other

467
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,720
but we want it to go back the other way

468
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,400
and we want it to go back the other way

469
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,720
when we press the button

470
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,000
so what we're going to do is we're going

471
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,360
to take this initial loop

472
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,159
and we're going to actually wrap it in

473
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,200
an if statement

474
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,880
of its own so if we go in here on line

475
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,840
22

476
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,000
and add a if

477
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,840
parentheses

478
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,559
eight

479
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,840
equals

480
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:53,840
too many there we go equals hi

481
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,600
and then wrap

482
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,159
all of this stuff

483
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,840
its own curly braces

484
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,960
thank you meadow all right

485
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,679
so we've added the if so this will only

486
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:18,159
happen

487
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,240
if we if we press the button as long as

488
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,559
we

489
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,440
read the button

490
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,640
so we're going to go ahead and back up a

491
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,480
little more here and

492
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,840
use our button

493
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:39,279
state

494
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,360
equals

495
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,279
digital read because we want to see

496
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,760
what's happening with that button

497
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,399
versus

498
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,600
writing to it and so now we have this

499
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,320
one

500
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,279
so we added this one at the very top so

501
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,880
it does it first thing every time we hit

502
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,559
the loop

503
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,240
and so basically we're taking that

504
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,760
button state variable

505
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,520
and having it equal the

506
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,279
what the button is doing indent does not

507
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,000
matter

508
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,279
this is this is a variant of c

509
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,159
we use semicolons and parentheses and

510
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,480
brackets and white space does not matter

511
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,840
in the least

512
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,279
and this is why i still prefer see to

513
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,880
python

514
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,080
um all right

515
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,960
so we've got our button so we've got our

516
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,559
variable for the button

517
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,480
and now it's going to take its cue from

518
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,000
what this button is actually

519
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,440
doing and we

520
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:08,340
[Laughter]

521
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,279
yeah and i think that's why i've always

522
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,799
struggled with python

523
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,360
is because i've always learned variants

524
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,320
of c

525
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,440
c plus plus c sharp

526
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,919
java where i had all of these nice

527
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,200
little uh

528
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,159
punctuation things to to tell the

529
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:27,840
computer how

530
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,080
what what line went where and then to

531
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,840
have to absolutely use

532
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,000
you know so many tabs in so many spaces

533
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,919
and and all that stuff

534
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,399
stuff it's actually kind of

535
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,600
counterintuitive to me

536
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,279
all right so now that we've

537
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,880
now that i've expressed my views on

538
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,360
python and and white spaces versus

539
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,960
punctuation

540
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,000
um let's get back to this so the 10

541
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,559
here digital read will take an argument

542
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,159
and the 10 here is basically we're going

543
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,600
to read it for 10 milliseconds

544
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,000
and so we've read it and now if it's

545
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,640
high

546
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,000
we're going to do the thing if it's low

547
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,200
we're not going to do the thing

548
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,840
and so if i click the button

549
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,679
we get leds

550
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,760
and if i leave it open but have the

551
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,840
simulation still riding nothing happens

552
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:39,918
so gay now we're almost there

553
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,559
all right and yes i am really enjoying

554
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,399
the chat at this point

555
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,880
and and want to make sure that i get

556
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,240
through the whole

557
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,399
sketch here okay

558
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,279
so now we're going to add in

559
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,320
another fun piece

560
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,159
one two take two curly brackets

561
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,200
so we're gonna go down here

562
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,960
after the curly bracket and to be

563
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,360
perfectly

564
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,480
pandemic that should actually be

565
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,320
in one so starting after the second

566
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,360
curly bracket

567
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,840
about line we're going to add a new line

568
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,840
34.

569
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:47,840
um jay are you using google chrome

570
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,840
hmm

571
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,799
all right i hate to do this to you but

572
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,840
do you have chrome installed

573
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,080
okay

574
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,760
all right so now we're going to

575
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,919
update so we have our if

576
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,360
and you remember how we said that with

577
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,440
an if we could say if this

578
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,360
is happening or else do this well let's

579
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,479
add in that else now

580
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,640
and so with the else we don't need to

581
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,039
declare anything else because we've

582
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,440
already got it covered in our if

583
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,279
if this thing is happening do this else

584
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,399
we don't need to to describe what else

585
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,799
is we just go with else

586
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,919
and so what we're going to do and

587
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,559
is now we're going to take our active

588
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,039
led

589
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,440
and we're going to make it equal

590
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,720
active

591
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,760
spacing doesn't matter but lowercase

592
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,279
versus capital letters do

593
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,600
we're going to take our active led and

594
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,960
make it active led to

595
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,080
just to kind of keep the uh

596
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,480
just to keep the the if from the elf

597
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,519
separate mostly in our brains

598
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,279
all right or in my brain at least all

599
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,039
right so let's add in the

600
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:54,080
serial print for this as well

601
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,440
and we're just gonna cheat

602
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,480
grab that and make it two

603
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,720
and then because the rest of

604
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,800
the statements under the else are very

605
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,560
similar we're going to grab these as

606
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,799
well

607
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,200
and just move them down here

608
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,800
and we're going to change these to 2

609
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,079
active led 2

610
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,119
active led 2

611
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,320
and then we come down to this guy

612
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,079
so instead of and we're just going to do

613
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,839
the opposite which is as simple as

614
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:42,560
changing that

615
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,239
to active led minus one

616
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,199
and then for this f for this else for

617
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,119
this if

618
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,599
wow okay star works run in between

619
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,960
sessions

620
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,560
we're actually going to make that less

621
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,320
than or equal to

622
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,320
1 which is one below our first

623
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,920
first led and then we're going to pop it

624
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:17,839
back to 8.

625
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,040
so now assuming i have didn't miss a

626
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:31,839
curly brace

627
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,040
with no button pressed they go one way

628
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,800
and with the button press they go the

629
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,040
other

630
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,200
huh and that's kind of interesting

631
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,880
because what i wrote this last night on

632
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,839
on a physical project it worked fine

633
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,280
all right so let's see we're missing

634
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,839
here

635
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:27,839
on that word

636
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:41,839
yes

637
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,560
oh ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

638
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,279
and the dangers of copy pasta

639
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,839
let's try this again

640
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,200
yep that's what i did so what i did was

641
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,640
i copy-pasted this

642
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,240
just to make sure we had adequate time

643
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,680
for questions

644
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,599
and some of the variables didn't get

645
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,680
updated to active led2

646
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,760
so now we should be working fine we go

647
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,280
one way let go

648
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:37,839
goes the other

649
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,839
yay

650
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,560
and then if we start it up again and hit

651
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,400
the serial monitor

652
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,680
yes button pressed

653
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,440
maybe there we go eight three four five

654
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:11,839
six

655
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:19,839
seven eight

656
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,000
um yes because we're doing the math

657
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,920
so what's happened is is that we've

658
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,280
taken our active led

659
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,359
and we've turned it into this one and

660
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,280
then because we want all of this stuff

661
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,839
to happen

662
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,280
to this one you could i probably could

663
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,359
have done it with just the one variable

664
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,640
but this kind of made it it just seemed

665
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,119
a little

666
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,880
to look a little easier in the in the

667
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,320
brain as i was thinking about how i was

668
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,960
going to teach this

669
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,480
so you probably could have just gotten

670
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,240
away with one variable but i used two

671
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,520
just to kind of show the difference and

672
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:15,839
then of course it tripped me up

673
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,400
does anybody have any other questions

674
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,599
we've got about

675
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,240
we've got about 15-20 minutes left that

676
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:57,839
i can stay in the session

677
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,480
um this code right now will be

678
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,880

personal wordpress at techgirlmn.com

688
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:53,839
let me bring that site up

689
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,839
yep

690
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,640
so yeah i'll uh all in between sessions

691
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,599
here

692
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,880
um throw on a a tdi 2020 page

693
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,920
and try to link everything there

694
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,000
there just so you have it and just so

695
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,440
that it's archived someplace on the

696
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:49,839
internet as well

697
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:02,840
okay

698
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:07,010
[Laughter]

699
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,480
um it should because i've noticed that

700
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,160
when i run the same code

701
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,720
on my uh on the physical badge it does

702
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,160
run just slightly differently

703
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,839
and let me

704
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:33,440
just take a look here because i've got

705
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:45,839
the the physical code that i wrote

706
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,640
okay and i figured out john had a

707
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,160
question earlier

708
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,839
where he said then he noticed if i hit

709
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,599
the button blinking the led goes back to

710
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,920
where it was before the state change

711
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,400
and yeah that is actually a line i

712
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,760
missed

713
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,760
when we were when we were adding in that

714
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,000
bit

715
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,839
and so let me find that line again

716
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:18,800
so what we need to do is right after we

717
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,839
this first if

718
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,160
oops stop

719
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,280
if you add in an

720
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,200
active led

721
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:37,359
2 equals

722
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:41,520
active led

723
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,640
now it'll flop back

724
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,720
instead of remembering where it was

725
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:55,839
so thanks for the catch there john

726
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,400
so now when we hold the button it goes

727
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,079
back and now it

728
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,079
will blink the same one again and go in

729
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:09,839
the opposite direction

730
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,920
you

731
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,760
hey ben you still here i had a quick

732
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:50,240
question for you

733
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,720
um that code that i borrowed from your

734
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,839
github

735
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:55,599
do you mind if i put that on my blog

736
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,040
modified to fit this project

737
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:03,440
thank you just wanted to be polite and

738
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,000
say

739
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:19,200
you know and ask before i did it

740
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,480
all right so um it's 45 after the hour

741
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,119
yeah it is but it's a little different

742
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:28,240
interpretation of

743
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,560
of basically the same thing without the

744
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,040
without the button involved and it's

745
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,040
and it's you know it's it's a different

746
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,560
interpret way to get to the same thing

747
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,760
and it's kind of neat to see the

748
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,280
difference

749
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,880
um so

750
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,040
i'll add that to my blog as well there's

751
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,160
another version of

752
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,720
there's another way to do this kind of

753
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,440
of

754
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,520
wiping back and forth often referring to

755
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,040
as a larson scanner

756
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,400
um and ben wrote and ben has a pretty

757
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,400
good

758
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,640
version of it that i altered to work

759
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,920
with this badge

760
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,200
um so it is

761
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,119
so it is about 45 past the hour um

762
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,040
i've certainly covered everything that i

763
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,480
think you need to know to at least get

764
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,520
started

765
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,359

little
