1
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:13,599
all right

2
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,880
well we are waiting for

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,080
our uh uh

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,320
they are rebooting their computer and

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,599
have asked someone to make small talk

6
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,679
so i will talk small make bad jokes

7
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,599
while we wait uh

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,040
let's see here

9
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:44,719
what does that do uh oh

10
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,280
uh cancel

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,239
that's screen sharing

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
we'll deal with that later so

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,600
uh rebooting is occurring

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,720
if you have questions uh or want to talk

15
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,600
about something

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,240
feel free to throw it in the chat and uh

17
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,920
we will ramble on about that while we

18
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,680
wait for

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,520
the reboot to occur and for them to

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,920
connect

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,040
let's see danielle back

22
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,240
yes you will be able to if you've missed

23
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,000
the first session the very first session

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,640
was

25
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,439
an overview of how to use tinkercad to

26
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,640
simulate a project

27
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,119
the second session was an overview of

28
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,720
how to use a breadboard

29
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,520
and physical arduino to build the

30
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,079
project

31
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,880
and this one is or a project prototype

32
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,079
using breadboard and

33
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,240
this one we're going to be looking at uh

34
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,840
actually physically soldering something

35
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,840
together

36
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,600
alternative values for the button

37
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:09,840
resistor 10k um

38
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,879
work so if you've got something that's

39
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:15,760
you know 8k

40
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,160
or 12k or whatever that that should be

41
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,280
fine

42
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,959
yeah anything over 1k will probably work

43
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,400
uh i honestly have not

44
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,000
messed around too much the arduino to

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,440
see how far

46
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,400
it can be pushed

47
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,720
uh yeah my beard is is pretty long now

48
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,440
yeah fifteen word yeah getting your

49
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,440
resistors warm is a

50
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,840
uh is not recommended

51
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,560
does my beard get stuck in the soldering

52
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,319
iron actually one of the lovely things

53
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,360
about

54
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,120
a long beard i will aim this down so you

55
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,480
can see

56
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,680
is that the table catches it

57
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,920
uh

58
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,440
turn on a light here so you can see

59
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,920
there we go so you can see that the

60
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,599
table catches the beard and keeps it out

61
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:32,480
of the way

62
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,280
if i need to uh get rid of it for a

63
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,959
moment i just uh

64
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,319
tuck it into my shirt like this and

65
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,679
voila it is gone

66
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,280
i also have a apron i can put on or i'll

67
00:03:47,280 --> 00:04:00,080
put a second shirt on

68
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,720
right we have some people attempting to

69
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,239
join i don't know why

70
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,280
is the cat that's a good question

71
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,079
where are you at raymond

72
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,199
usually when i start a live stream or a

73
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:21,918
phone call

74
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,120
she's right up in here but she i think

75
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,199
is laying down upstairs

76
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,840
in the bedroom uh chilling

77
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,520
so she's not with me currently she's

78
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,000
upstairs

79
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,840
i need to clean this room up

80
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,840
ah i'm not sure what you mean by half

81
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:11,840
boards four columns

82
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:25,840
all right joe

83
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,199
uh the question is is this

84
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,360
recorded yes it's going to be recorded

85
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,520
hey joe

86
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,199
sorry i don't seem to like my overhead

87
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,039
camera but uh if you only have one of

88
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:47,759
these single

89
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,720
single part boards you can still do it

90
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,000
but what you might have to do is have a

91
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,520
bunch of wires that jumper

92
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,400
all your leds over that makes sense

93
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,639
because i think in the example it was

94
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,319
like a double edged

95
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,800
breadboard kind of like that i see

96
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,919
that's all well

97
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,000
much demonstration

98
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,840
careful yeah there we go

99
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:35,680
rebooting recompiling the kernel

100
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,720
how bad is it

101
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:49,840
they'll be here soon i believe

102
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,280
oh

103
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,759
they're having one of those your

104
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,599
computer ran into a problem and needs to

105
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:00,800
be restarted again

106
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,840
uh issues

107
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,840
good

108
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,840
all right coordinating with uh

109
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,160
all right so uh let's talk about the

110
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,280
theory behind soldering what

111
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,919
what we're working on um while we wait

112
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:42,319
for

113
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,199
the technical issues to be uh dealt with

114
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,879
and then

115
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,080
chris can begin the uh the demo

116
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,759
uh so let's let's start with the first

117
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,160
thing

118
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,080
uh soldering is not like other forms of

119
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,680
sticking things together it's not like

120
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,280
tape or glue or a lot of

121
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,960
pressure is your friend if you use a lot

122
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,120
of pressure you're going to have a bad

123
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,840
time

124
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,000
in addition to possibly damaging your

125
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,199
soldering iron

126
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,879
you're going to cause the pcb to move

127
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,400
you're going to bend parts

128
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,080
you're going to you're probably going to

129
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,280
damage things

130
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,960
[Music]

131
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,800
when you're using your soldering iron

132
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,120
you want to use very light pressure

133
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,720
this is not on currently

134
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,840
uh let me

135
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,079
switch see can i switch cameras

136
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,839
um

137
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,800
so when we are putting the iron down

138
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,240
we're going to want to just

139
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,320
gently lay it here we don't want to push

140
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,920
down we don't want to

141
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,320
be aggressive we just want to lay it in

142
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,600
place

143
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,120
we're using our hands let me switch

144
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,920
cameras again

145
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,120
this is i'm not using obs so switching

146
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,000
between cameras is

147
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,680
problematic

148
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,800
we want to lay the iron gently down

149
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,640
and just use the tip to apply heat

150
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,360
soldering is all about heat and heat

151
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,000
management

152
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,760
where we're putting the heat and what

153
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,320
work we need

154
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,480
so when we're doing our soldering want

155
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,080
to think very carefully about where the

156
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,200
heat is

157
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,959
and where it isn't and where we want it

158
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,320
to be

159
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,240
when we're trying to create an

160
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,000
electromechanical connection using

161
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,040
solder

162
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,760
we need to

163
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,000
solder is going to flow and it's going

164
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,399
to flow to the hottest thing that it can

165
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,000
uh that is going to be its strong

166
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,920
preference the hottest thing it can flow

167
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,480
to

168
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,560
is going to be the iron so we're going

169
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,800
to want to make it work to get there

170
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,440
when we apply the heat we're going to

171
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,200
apply the heat on one side

172
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,880
of the pad then we're going to put

173
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,640
solder on the other side so that it has

174
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,360
to work

175
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,920
going around the part to get over to the

176
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,600
heat

177
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,720
and that is going to make it

178
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,279
significantly smoother if we just

179
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,360
put the solder directly on the heat it

180
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,040
has very little

181
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,200
motivation to leave that heat and go to

182
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,560
something that's relatively

183
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,880
much colder like the pcb or anything

184
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,880
that's not being actively heated by a

185
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,360
heating element like sutter iron is

186
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,720
so that is one of the things you're

187
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,800
going to want to keep in mind

188
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,200
as you uh work on this project and

189
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,640
follow along with the demo

190
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,079
you're going to be paying attention to

191
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,160
where the heat is and making the solder

192
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,800
do the work for you

193
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,680
try to solder by putting a big ball of

194
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,160
solder

195
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,839
on the then applying that directly to

196
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:54,880
the board

197
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,640
and that can work but

198
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,839
it's going and more frustrating and

199
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,000
require a lot more flux

200
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,600
instead what we're going to want to do

201
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,880
is apply a small amount of solder

202
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,519
uh when we tin the iron on the other on

203
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,200
one side of the board

204
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,160
make the solder work to get to that heat

205
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,680
and you'll see that

206
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,720
how it flows after we get that flow

207
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,399
we're going to want to remove the solder

208
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,519
but we're going to want to leave the

209
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,040
heat there for a second

210
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,640
and that will allow the solder to

211
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,399
the heat to homogenize the solder all

212
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,440
the way through and give you a really

213
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,519
good connection

214
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,440
operator so i will

215
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,839
bugger off and let them take over

216
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,000
hi guys just want to make sure everybody

217
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,279
can hear me to start with

218
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,920
because i had a blue screen of death

219
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,040
because

220
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:57,839
murphy's law

221
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,839
excellent all right

222
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,480
so this is the third and final version

223
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,440
that i'm not going to say ever

224
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,160
because you know we might revisit this

225
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:14,959
project

226
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,680
if we get to meet in person because i

227
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,519
could see this going really nicely on a

228
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,560
fancy yardy

229
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,040
artsy pcb anyway um so this is what this

230
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,040
we're making this session

231
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,480
um it's the same as the other two if you

232
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,120
were in

233
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,760
either one of the earlier sessions um

234
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,440
we're basically gonna build our own

235
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,480
little

236
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,760
little arduino experimental platform

237
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,200
seven leds four colors a button for

238
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,680
input

239
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,160
and an arduino nano yay

240
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,560
so is everybody ready to get started you

241
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,839
got your irons all

242
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,000
hot and all ready to go

243
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,839
yes okay good

244
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,959
okay so here we have our electro cookie

245
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,560
if you found one of these on amazon

246
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,079
great if you didn't

247
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,600
i'm hoping that you found something

248
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,720
appropriately similar

249
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,000
and so we're just going to dive right in

250
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,959
because

251
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,079
um that's the one thing about being the

252
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,600
um hardware person it's kind of like

253
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,560
when the shoemaker's kids go barefoot

254
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,600
you

255
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,000
spend all day fixing other people's

256
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,959
problems for libraries and whatnot

257
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,519
and so you just want to go home and use

258
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,800
your own system

259
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
and just kind of ignore those general

260
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,480
maintenance tests that i probably should

261
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,839
not be putting off any longer

262
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,600
all right so we're going to start with

263
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,880
the with the uh

264
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,160
with the oh my god what is this this is

265
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,040
a resistor

266
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,320
hi yeah um apparently i do need a an

267
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,880
adult beverage at this point

268
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,839
um

269
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,240
so yeah so we're gonna bend our leds

270
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,399
um and then we're gonna put them on the

271
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,360
board

272
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,800
and i just lost my notes oh my god

273
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,880
ah there we go prototype yay

274
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,680
all right so we're going to start with

275
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,360
our 220

276
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,560
ohm resistors these are current limiting

277
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,279
resistors

278
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,040
for the leds basically the

279
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,959
arduino puts out more power than the

280
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,800
leds can handle on their own

281
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,959
so we use a resistor to limit the

282
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,519
current

283
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,120
and if you've got the notes all of these

284
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,519
go

285
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,079
from the wow

286
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,079
oh let's try it that way oh that looks

287
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,399
much better

288
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,480
okay so all of these go

289
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,000
from row j

290
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,760
into the negative rail

291
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,040
and so this one goes into number four

292
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,320
like that and then make it

293
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,519
see if i can get oriented here

294
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,040
and there's a nice close-up shot for

295
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,959
number four

296
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,040
and back to the wide angle

297
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,880
and then on the other side holding the

298
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,279
resistor down just bend these out just

299
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,320
enough

300
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,680
so that it stays put and then we're

301
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,399
going to put the next one in

302
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,320
at j8 and the negative rail

303
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,560
and yes i'm using my fancy little

304
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,839
component bendy tool

305
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,440
because if you've got it why not

306
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,880
and again with the flip

307
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:36,639
um

308
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,399
so that's what you so if you really

309
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,920
really have to have one of these

310
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,560
um i guess search for it on amazon

311
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:51,040
i hear tell that um

312
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,839
oh the place um god

313
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,439
the place with the stls um

314
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,839
wow

315
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,720
yes thingiverse thank you ben and

316
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,240
apparently sparkfun has them too

317
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,400
okay now that we have that solved and

318
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,559
i might be able to talk again by the end

319
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,199
of the session

320
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:32,559
so we're at 12 j16

321
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,799
bending those out i don't

322
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:46,880
all right

323
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,640
and then we need to go with j20

324
00:17:50,640 --> 00:18:01,840
negative and row j

325
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,080
and this is number 25 j24

326
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,960
if somebody yells bingo i'm just gonna

327
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,160
be

328
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,080
that would just be amazing at this point

329
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,559
and there's that one and oh

330
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,360
get out one more

331
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:43,280
and bend that in place all right

332
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,760
and this one goes into 28.

333
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,678
all right

334
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,840
so now that we have our resistors placed

335
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,120
i stopped okay there's that

336
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,640
we're going to flip the board over and

337
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,760
solder them on the back side

338
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,760
and so before i start soldering i'm

339
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,280
gonna try to

340
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,720
just adjust here here and get a good

341
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,960
angle for the other camera for you

342
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,280
there we go we're gonna do a couple with

343
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,080
that

344
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,760
so now we're on close up and so you can

345
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,360
see

346
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,320
what i got going here

347
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,720
and as we've talked about handy handy

348
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,360
handy flux

349
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,799
i like a liquid for through-hole

350
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,360
projects

351
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,640
i'll put it on camera for the other on

352
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,760
the other uh

353
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,720
when i have the other camera back up um

354
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,240
you can actually get it looks almost

355
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,559
like a magic marker

356
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,320
and that's better for um

357
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,679
surface mount and then sometimes

358
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,679
um you'll see a paste and that's best

359
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,919
for wires and i do have all three laying

360
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,240
around my workshop of course

361
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,559
so like ben was explaining you want to

362
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,360
heat this up

363
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,480
and touch a little solder to it maybe

364
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,960
and maybe my iron's still dirty oh come

365
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,960
on

366
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,320
come on there we go

367
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,679
starting to get there

368
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:41,280
all right a second let me tin this

369
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,760
so one of the things to keep in mind and

370
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,720
i'll bring the tip

371
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,159
back in the frame here um if your tip of

372
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,600
your soldering iron isn't like

373
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,760
super shiny it's not going to conduct

374
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,360
heat as well

375
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,799
and i'm kind of hoping ben went over

376
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,080
this a little bit so you just throw a

377
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,640
little solder on there

378
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,840
and then clean it back off

379
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,440
um i like a ball of brass some people

380
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,840
prefer water

381
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,840
so let's do the one side of the ones

382
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,480
that are visible

383
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:21,360
first and then we'll spin this around

384
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,000
now this is one of those things that

385
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,679
this technique works for me

386
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,120
and it may not work as well for you

387
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,159
i find it easier to always

388
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,159
have the soldering iron in my right hand

389
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,159
always have the solder in my left

390
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,880
and then moving the work itself as

391
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,799
needed

392
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,600
to get those joints so that i'm in a

393
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,520
good position to solder those joints

394
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,280
and let's see this one's in frame so

395
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,240
we'll do this one too

396
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,640
and then we'll just keep going on down

397
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,960
find some more that are

398
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,240
ready to be soldered and in the frame

399
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:13,840
and there's one and there's one

400
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:27,840
and there's one

401
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,960
and there's one

402
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:41,840
and now we're going to spin this around

403
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,200
and we got a few more here in frame

404
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:55,840
so we'll do those

405
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,559
and ben put a good point here in the

406
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,159
chat that water and sponge will pull

407
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,320
heat out of the tip and can accelerate

408
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,879
the uh

409
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,480
and accelerate how fast your tip

410
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,159
deteriorates

411
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,520
um or where whereas out breaks down

412
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,400
i use little balls of

413
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,080
they look like brillo pads but they're

414
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,400
made of brass and when we go back to the

415
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,840
wide view i'll show you that

416
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,720
as well i actually

417
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,440
printed my own

418
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,480
holder for them but you can get but they

419
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,679
do come

420
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,520
but you can get them as well and where

421
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,799
is that that's right there okay

422
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,320
so there's the resistors

423
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,240
put the iron back in the holder because

424
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,240
really really hot

425
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,200
and we'll wipe back to the wide screen

426
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,400
and so i'll give you

427
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,640
all time to to work on that while i show

428
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,919
you a couple of things here

429
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,159
so this is how i clean my tip um

430
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,720
they're a little smaller i found this

431
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,840
little smaller holder

432
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,320
on thingiverse now that i no longer

433
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,000
brain farting about where

434
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,039
where i get my stls

435
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,960
and so the iron actually just kind of

436
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,840
goes in here and you stab it a few times

437
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,559
and it's kind of

438
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,960
pleasantly satisfying to be able to stab

439
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,880
something and then this tip's all shiny

440
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,520
and then you end up with little bits of

441
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,640
solder and a note on solder um

442
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,400
i'm not sure if ben talked about this

443
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,760
while i was dealing with the blue screen

444
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,640
of death

445
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,840
um but um if it seems like mine's going

446
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,039
super easy

447
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,320
um that's because i go old school this

448
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,080
is leaded solder it's actually

449
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,840
63 tin and 37 blood

450
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,559
lead with a uh with extra with a little

451
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,200
bit of extra solder in the core

452
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,840
so is everybody got their resistors done

453
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,720
and ready to cut

454
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,159
okay that's fine i figured that of all

455
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,080
the sessions that this one was gonna

456
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,440
go as long or if not over so that's fine

457
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,600
we can wait

458
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:29,840
no worries

459
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,440
give me a second

460
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,799
to get my cheaters on

461
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,679
because i will be the first to admit

462
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,360
that i do not have the best

463
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,400
eyesight and actually wear

464
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,520
little magnifying glasses um lately i've

465
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,039
taken to using a

466
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,480
little microscope that's got a seven

467
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,039
inch screen i do most of my soldering

468
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,559
under that these days but these cheaters

469
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:11,520
will be

470
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,559
fine for the stream

471
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,279
okay done and jay

472
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,559
can't find their solder okay

473
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,679
yeah jay as long as you get a good um

474
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,520
solid bend on all the leads you should

475
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,600
be able to go through and solder this

476
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,240
anytime

477
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,559
so can i get an r or ready in the chat

478
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,600
please and we'll move on

479
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,440
excellent all right so the next thing

480
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,080
we're going to do

481
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,400
is we're going to now that we've got our

482
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,320
resistors on we're going to just trim

483
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,360
off the little legs

484
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,440
and when you do this um

485
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,600
set these down down hold the

486
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,120
hold what you're clipping off in one

487
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,279
hand and

488
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,880
cut with the other mostly because

489
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,679
if you don't i can guarantee you that

490
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:18,640
this will end up

491
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,559
in your foot and usually at 3 am

492
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,159
when you're least equipped to deal with

493
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,240
it

494
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,080
not that i would have had any experience

495
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,840
of this whatsoever

496
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,919
okay so there's our resistors

497
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,279
now we're gonna do the long part next um

498
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,960
just because the way um the prototype

499
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,520
ended up

500
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,399
because i just had to at least once in

501
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,679
one project

502
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,760
use 10 millimeter leds

503
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:12,559
just for the just for the wtf factor

504
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,320
so we're actually going to skip ahead

505
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,640
and do the wires first

506
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,000
and then we're going to come back and do

507
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,840
the leds

508
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,000
so go ahead and get out some wires

509
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,600
i'm going to grab some hopefully maybe

510
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,080
ah

511
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,399
hell

512
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,399
i guess we rustle stuff from the back

513
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,840
here

514
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,159
oh here's some too okay so i'm just

515
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,360
gonna cut up some um

516
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,200
some other jumpers to make sure that we

517
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,960
have colors

518
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,840
um so like these came in from china

519
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,279
broken

520
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,200
like whatever and these are just

521
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,360
and there's see that one's broken but

522
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,640
you know the wire in between them is

523
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,159
still good and it helps us get

524
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,159
everything color coded

525
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,440
so that'll be useful

526
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,720
so we're going to start with the red

527
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:27,520
and tool tool tool tool tool there we go

528
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,360
and this is your pretty standard wire

529
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,200
clippers

530
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,720
the way i like to do this is i usually

531
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,000
like to take the heads off first

532
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,080
like so and then we're going to strip

533
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,720
these back

534
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,919
one on each side

535
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,159
and now here's the tricky part you want

536
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,679
to take

537
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,039
and hold the bare wires tight

538
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,559
and then twist the wire and

539
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,960
let me get the other camera out here

540
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,919
this in front of the other camera okay

541
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,520
right there

542
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,039
and we'll get the other camera going

543
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,279
here

544
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,640
and you can see how that's kind of like

545
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,440
now in a tight little

546
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,640
spiral versus the other end

547
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,000
which is a little bit all over the place

548
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,600
and this one's going to be a lot easier

549
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,240
to solder

550
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:37,840
and back out

551
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,960
so here's wire so here's the other end

552
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,320
all twisted

553
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,760
um and we're going to go

554
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,960
total pro on this

555
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,159
this as soon as i've

556
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,200
figure out where i set the flux down in

557
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,679
oh there we go

558
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,240
all right so i'm just going to add a

559
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,039
little drop there

560
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,480
um so like i said i do use leaded solder

561
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,200
um realistically if you look at the

562
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,240
material data safety sheets for lead

563
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,640
it's not super dangerous until you start

564
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,840
ingesting it

565
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,559
so as long as you wash your hands you

566
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,519
can use leaded solder it's fine

567
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,000
so this is my technique for tuning wires

568
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,640
um

569
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,240
they're like you know it's one of those

570
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,279
things that everybody has a favorite

571
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,600
i like putting a bottle of solder on the

572
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,559
tip of my iron

573
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:47,840
and just running it through

574
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,840
and now we have our perfectly tinned

575
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,760
wire yay

576
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,559
well almost

577
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,519
and that does happen sometimes i don't

578
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,360
know let's see if we can

579
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,760
put that in front of the big screen the

580
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,720
close-up yeah i got a little blob there

581
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,799
usually i just cut those off you could

582
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,679
work it some more or cut it off

583
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,840
that's kind of a dealer's choice

584
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,600
situation

585
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,519
so it's way at the end so we'll just

586
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,840
kind of

587
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,600
boop go on okay so now that we have our

588
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,240
perfectly ready to put on the breadboard

589
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,960
soldered wire

590
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,320
we're going to bend the shiny parts

591
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,159
at 90 degrees

592
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,519
and 90 degrees

593
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,039
and then this is going to go

594
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,559
in j27

595
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,919
and let's get this one right this time

596
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,399
and it's

597
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:11,840
and it's it's

598
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,080
yeah it should be

599
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,440
i 11 is that what i have written down

600
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,200
somebody check the sheet for me thank

601
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,840
you jay it is i 11.

602
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,639
so then we're gonna go over here to i

603
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,760
11.

604
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,440
because there's nothing like a blue

605
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,120
screen of death to completely and

606
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,080
totally throw you off your game

607
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,039
and so we're going to bend that in and

608
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,799
unlike the resistors which

609
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,360
made more sense to do in a bunch um

610
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,760
we're going to do these individually

611
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,039
so let me get that under the

612
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,960
close-up camera

613
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,840
things aside here

614
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,918
there we go and so we wipe over

615
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,399
and clean the iron

616
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:35,839
and there's one side

617
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:41,168
[Music]

618
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:49,839
and there's the other

619
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:03,760
and then just like before

620
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,800
we're going to trim away

621
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,680
any excess

622
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,839
so there's our

623
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:30,170
so there's our first wire

624
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:33,599
[Music]

625
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,320
and thank you peter for that perfect

626
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,280
textbook answer

627
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,839
awesome

628
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,040
all right let's move on

629
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,839
to our first yellow

630
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,119
and we got the tool

631
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,320
and we take the heads

632
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,480
and kind of start sweeping things off

633
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,920
out of camera because

634
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,079
oh god

635
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,959
there's one

636
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,839
and there's two and

637
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:41,839
spin

638
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,200
and spin and i keep trying to do this

639
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,760
closer to me

640
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,119
to me because that's what i'm used to

641
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,839
so if i'm ever way way out of frame just

642
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,880
start yelling screaming hollering

643
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,640
it will take care of it and

644
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,920
one thing that is going to get out of

645
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,880
frame is i basically just put down a

646
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,839
little puddle

647
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,079
of flux so that i can just dip these

648
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,400
guys

649
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,800
because these mats have little pockets

650
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,040
and in fact i have a piece of old mat

651
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,480
here

652
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,160
that will fill instead so that we can

653
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,599
kind of have it see that you can kind of

654
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:28,960
see it

655
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,240
so there's my little puddle

656
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,839
a little puddle of secret sauce

657
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,280
and a little some

658
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,240
a little tinning

659
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,520
and a little tin there

660
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,839
and then we'll clean off the excess

661
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,839
solder

662
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,520
stand up so it's easier to grab okay

663
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,640
so once again we've got it tinned

664
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,680
and the big thing is is that this board

665
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,040
is designed as practice

666
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,079
so while i'll make every effort

667
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,760
imaginable to make sure that everybody

668
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,000
is on the same page

669
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,079
um keep in mind that you know if you

670
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,400
only get two done or four done or five

671
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,680
done

672
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,440
um that's fine during the session that's

673
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,200
fine it's not

674
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,119
not a big deal like i said a lot of this

675
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,160
board is practice

676
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,319
so we're bent over bent over

677
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,839
there we go

678
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,599
and now we'll drop

679
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,920
into

680
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,000
there we go oh there it is

681
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,320
okay

682
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,078
and there's our joint

683
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,160
and we got that one and let's drop a

684
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,680
little flux on the other one it seemed a

685
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,520
little stiff

686
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,000
all right

687
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,839
there we go

688
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:11,839
all right and there's the next one

689
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,759
and to cut

690
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,839
and i cut there

691
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:38,720
and i cut there there's that one

692
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,480
and now let's see we've got another

693
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,880
yellow

694
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:53,839
yep there's another yellow

695
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,240
and we'll do i'll do one more i'll do

696
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,680
this one

697
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,359
and then we'll wait and let people catch

698
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:06,000
up

699
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,640
because i know that

700
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:16,439
[Music]

701
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,920
i'm doing this at what feels like a slow

702
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,680
pace

703
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,560
to kind of help you keep up but the

704
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,359
reality is

705
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:29,040
is that it probably is a little fast

706
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:35,839
so we'll do this this one here

707
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:42,160
and this one will be into 19

708
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:49,839
here

709
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,000
okay and then

710
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,680
here and i did not tend these because

711
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:03,839
it's late and i've just yeah

712
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,560
oh okay so there are ten

713
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,560
and a little more chanting on the side

714
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:16,240
maybe

715
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:31,839
there we go look at that

716
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,240
wow haha look at that

717
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,880
all right so that's kind of interesting

718
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,240
and fun

719
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,920
um you can see that these were done by

720
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,800
two different manufacturers

721
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,640
so while they both individually looked

722
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,400
yellow they do not look they're not the

723
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,480
same color on the board that's kind of

724
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,520
awesome

725
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,920
all right or i'm too easily amused

726
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,079
because

727
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,400
i'm too easily amused all right so let's

728
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,839
get

729
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:09,119
our little puddle out of the way

730
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,400
get this over where we can see it in the

731
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,400
close-up

732
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,200
click the button

733
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:25,119
and we'll do number three

734
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,319
there's the one side

735
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:41,839
and there's the other

736
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,280
all right

737
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:55,839
and we'll wipe back to the wide view

738
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:23,839
and don't mind me

739
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,520
studio lighting sometimes things look

740
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,440
soldered that aren't

741
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,160
all right so we've got our first three

742
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,800
and then we'll

743
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,480
go ahead and give everybody a good

744
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,319
minute or two here to make sure that

745
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:51,839
everybody's caught up

746
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,839
um

747
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,119
you can tell it's not soldered because

748
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,839
it doesn't work

749
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,760
yeah that that's usually a good good

750
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:47,839
indicator too

751
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:02,319
all right

752
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:15,839
yes i'll be patient

753
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:28,880
um so yeah and the thing with soldering

754
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:29,119
is

755
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,760
is that it's one of those things that it

756
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:32,240
can be

757
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:36,079
either nerve-racking or totally

758
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,520
relaxing um once you get it down

759
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,240
um honestly i usually solder while

760
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:42,880
watching

761
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,560
tv or or a baseball game or

762
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,040
whatever

763
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,400
especially when you realize that your

764
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,880
maker space just got closed because of a

765
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,400
pandemic and all of a sudden you're

766
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,319
going to have to hand assemble

767
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,040
all your things

768
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:11,839
so

769
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:17,119
[Laughter]

770
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:20,480
yes i've had that happen um

771
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,680
in case you missed it meadow's done it

772
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,480
where's

773
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,040
where just put the continuity meter on

774
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,079
it and it's

775
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,000
and it pings and it says yes i'm

776
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,240
connected and then

777
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,839
when you actually power up the circuit

778
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,680
it doesn't work okay

779
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,880
so for the green ones we're going to

780
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,880
talk about what happens

781
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,400
if you don't have the right length

782
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,480
jumper or if you're going off of a

783
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,000
spooler wire

784
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,359
i'm going to show you the technique that

785
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,680
i like to use for that um

786
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,480
you can you know obviously if this

787
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,240
doesn't work for you we can do something

788
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:52,960
different

789
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,400
so i'm going to pretend that this is on

790
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,480
a spool and just cut the one end for now

791
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,840
and then we're going to strip the one

792
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:04,119
[Music]

793
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:07,040
end

794
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:11,359
and so if it's on a spool or too long or

795
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:14,559
or you've taken i guess work and

796
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:18,720
yep it's that little off-camera puddle

797
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,439
no roblox

798
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,760
all right we'll drop down a little there

799
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,400
a little there

800
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,160
put that back for a second

801
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,599
got that bent like we normally would

802
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:40,720
and we're gonna go here

803
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:45,599
and just bend it down and then so what

804
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:46,880
you do

805
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,680
in that case is you kind of want to just

806
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:57,280
flow it around and you can use a marker

807
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,000
i just use my fingers and so now you

808
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,040
kind of know that

809
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,558
we only need that much

810
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,160
and then we can strip it

811
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:14,160
down spin

812
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:17,839
flux

813
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:31,839
solder

814
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:45,839
and

815
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:52,400
and then there we are there

816
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,480
and probably still longer than it needs

817
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,160
to be

818
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,598
so let's go ahead

819
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,359
take off a little more maybe if we're

820
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:13,839
lucky

821
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,880
ah i got it

822
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:22,078
there

823
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,440
and then of course we got a little part

824
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,559
now that's not tinned

825
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:32,640
so there's that

826
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:41,839
and doink

827
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:55,839
do this again

828
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:09,839
and we got that bent into place yay

829
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:28,160
and then we'll get this up by the dot

830
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:31,520
by the way a little bit by the dot

831
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:37,839
all right left left

832
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:50,400
there we go

833
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,440
and what the heck random transitions are

834
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,920
more fun

835
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:05,839
a little flux

836
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,640
and i think there's probably enough

837
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,839
solder on that tip yep

838
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:18,000
and then we'll go over here

839
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,720
we're good there

840
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:32,079
and

841
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:35,200
and so there's green one

842
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,800
and now we're going to do the same thing

843
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,520
for green too

844
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:47,839
and oh we're on camera

845
00:52:49,359 --> 00:53:01,839
back over here

846
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,160
um we're going to go digital 2 through

847
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,200
whatever

848
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,439
um

849
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:24,319
so it'll be digital 2 for the red

850
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:30,558
and digital nine for the last blue

851
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,200
no we're supposed to keep the mint the

852
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,280
magic smoke in the com

853
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:57,839
in the components people

854
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:03,359
the idea is to keep the magic smoke in

855
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:04,640
the components

856
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:11,839
so that they function properly

857
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:39,839
all right

858
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,079
and clean this off because we haven't in

859
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:53,839
a bit

860
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:59,680
okay and then we'll turn this

861
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:07,839
antonette

862
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:18,839
it's it's still magic if you don't see

863
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:21,839
it

864
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,480
yes unfortunately even if you do not see

865
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,799
the magic smoke come out

866
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:29,040
if magic smoke has come out your your

867
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:33,279
device may not function as intended

868
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:37,680
but it's still yes magic blue smoke

869
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:47,200
all right so there's the other

870
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,520
get green in there nice and tight oh

871
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,920
there it is

872
00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:03,839
yes

873
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:08,160
yes we've reached the goofy part of the

874
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,680
session where you're going to see random

875
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,040
weird transitions

876
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:16,960
and and all kinds of good things

877
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:31,359
so there's one side of the green wire

878
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:35,040
and here comes the other

879
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:45,839
yay

880
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,920
oh sorry about that

881
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,000
actually brought it up a little closer

882
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,240
to me to uh

883
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,359
cut because that's what i'm used to

884
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:04,960
i'm not used to doing this on camera i'm

885
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,480
used to doing this

886
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,280
by myself in my basement with my dog

887
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:13,599
sleeping on my foot and

888
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:16,799
and the twins are the vikings

889
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:20,079
streaming live next to me all right so

890
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:23,119
we're on to blue so

891
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:27,839
yay blue wire

00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:09,520
spin

895
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:15,279
off climb our flux puddle

896
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,559
little tin

897
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,839
built in

898
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:37,839
a little cleaning

899
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:51,839
uh

900
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:55,119
and flip

901
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:59,280
flip those down and

902
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,839
find this

zoom in

905
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,400
and we're ready for the next all right

906
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,839
there's that

907
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:33,839
and there's that

908
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,960
a little excess to trim off

909
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:47,839
and we'll do the other side off camera

910
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,319
and we'll fade back out

911
00:59:52,720 --> 01:00:01,839
and there's the blue

912
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:15,839
and here's another little blue

913
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:29,839
okay

914
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:33,200
and the twist

915
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:42,799
and the twist

916
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:48,400
and the off camera puddle o

flux

918
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:13,359
i'll attack the ball of brass okay

919
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:17,279
all right and then we got that

920
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:25,839
and that

921
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:30,880
that's in there it spins around and goes

922
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:31,370
in here

let's go there again that goes back

926
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,079
there yay

927
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:53,839
all right and then

928
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,039
and there we go there

929
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:21,839
and there we go there

930
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,160
i don't know oops i did the other side

931
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:31,440
off screen i'm sorry

01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,280
and mark is correct

936
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:56,559
about that um to be fair

937
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:58,640
um it's off camera so i'll bring it on

938
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:00,799
camera um i found

939
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:03,920
this 10 bucks on amazon

940
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,480
it's actually usb rechargeable so i can

941
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,799
put it wherever i need to

942
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:11,760
to and it does blow across i haven't i

943
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,119
haven't had it on

944
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:14,640
just because i was worried about the

945
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:17,920
smoke blowing out too much for the

946
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:31,039
cameras

947
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:33,280
so yes do not solder like in the back

closet

949
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:37,440
with no ventilation

950
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,440
you probably get away with it the first

951
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,119
few times but it's not a

952
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:47,920
lot good long-term idea

953
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:53,700

955
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:58,240
so i've got all my leads that go to my

956
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,879
leds

957
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,599
ready ready and i'm going to go ahead

958
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:07,119
give you guys a couple of minutes

959
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:12,240
i mean it's too

[Music]

961
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:27,839

okay

965
01:05:34,839 --> 01:05:37,839
so

966
01:05:48,839 --> 01:05:51,839
uh

967
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:19,839
um

968
01:06:58,839 --> 01:07:01,839
sorry

969
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:18,240
does polarity matter on the placement of

970
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:21,520
the lcds yes yes yes indeed

971
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,799
and we'll get to that here in a second

972
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,000
i just wanted to make sure that

973
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,880
everybody was done with their wires

974
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,640
so if we could get that good old ready

975
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,880
check going

976
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,280
well i pull out some leds here there's a

977
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:37,200
red one

978
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:42,799
and a yellow one and another yellow one

979
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:47,839
no you stay stay green

980
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:53,759
green blue blue

981
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:57,839
okay

982
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:04,400
[Music]

983
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:10,559
all right we're going to move on here

984
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:15,760
and so these are big 10 millimeter leds

985
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:18,479
uh let me see if i have i do not have

986
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:25,839
something small or handy i do okay

987
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:34,000
okay so these are our 10 millimeter leds

988
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:37,279
long legs positive short legs negative

989
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:38,640
our negative is going to line up with

990
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,238
our resistor the positive is going to

991
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:42,080
line up with the wire

992
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,158
this is a more traditional three

993
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:47,198
millimeter led

994
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,399
unlike these big ones that don't really

995
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:51,359
have it

996
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:54,479
i just wanted to point out that on the

997
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:58,399
on a regular normal sized led

998
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:01,839
that there was actually a flat side

999
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:07,120
that lines up with the negative leg

1000
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:11,120
um so you can kind of see it there

1001
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,719
there but that's yeah that's a this is

1002
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:14,479
more of a normal size led this is what

1003
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:15,920
we're using

1004
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:19,040
just to give you some perspective

1005
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:20,799
i could pull out a 603 which would

1006
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:22,319
really

1007
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:23,920
drive home how much smaller they've

1008
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,839
gotten through the years

1009
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:30,238
so let's start with the the red one

1010
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:35,120
and so that's going to go in h

1011
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:40,080
27 28 for the short leg

1012
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:42,238
and then these are not going to go all

1013
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:43,439
the way through they are going to ride

1014
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:45,359
on these wires a little bit

1015
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:49,839
so don't be alarmed

1016
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:51,520
and once again this is going to be a

1017
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,439
good case of place them all and then

1018
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,919
solder

1019
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:01,040
yeah we have to go that way wow i mopped

1020
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,840
this up

1021
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:11,760
and so they made blue wrong color

1022
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:16,480
okay

1023
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:20,639
and wow

1024
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:25,760
i need a frosty malted beverage

1025
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,560
and i i don't and i'm not talking about

1026
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:29,920
something that comes from the dairy

1027
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:32,159
queen

1028
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:34,800
all right so positive negative positive

1029
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,199
negative

1030
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,679
we're just going to let them ride on the

1031
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:43,120
wire see if we can if we have to

1032
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:46,159
push things aside if you need to

1033
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:49,040
let's go this way

1034
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:50,960
i actually screwed up when i did the

1035
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:52,800
wires i'm sorry they should have been

1036
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:59,840
down around f my bad

1037
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,800
so there we go

1038
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,600
and if you're very gentle you can flip

1039
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:36,159
those over

1040
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,159
and then we're just going to take the

1041
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:41,839
legs and bend them out a bit

1042
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,920
and why are we not sitting straight okay

1043
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,640
let me look here

1044
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:06,719
okay so mine aren't straight um that's

1045
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:08,560
probably because i got them from two

1046
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,440
separate sources

1047
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:14,480
the ones i ordered some of these i

1048
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:15,760
ordered off of amazon

1049
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:18,480
and they're actually flat on two sides

1050
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,480
and then some of these

1051
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:22,560
i stole from my maker space and they're

1052
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,600
only flat on one side

1053
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:28,800
so that thing you know

1054
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,719
things happen so i'm going to drop some

1055
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:32,800
of these down

1056
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,920
and some of these up if yours have two

1057
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,679
flat sides

1058
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:40,719
um it doesn't have any flat sides so if

1059
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:42,400
yours have the two flat sides they'll

1060
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,920
fit really

1061
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:47,600
good nice and tight together

1062
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,440
if you have the ones that are round

1063
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:52,640
you're going to want to alternate them

1064
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:58,480
a little bit so one up one down

1065
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:03,040
as needed

1066
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:04,920
let's try that one

1067
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:08,000
[Music]

1068
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,239
yay

1069
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,640
and once again i'd like to point out

1070
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:19,840
that the demo gods do hate me

1071
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,920
that i am not their friend

1072
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:29,679
or their colleague or whatever

1073
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:32,830
but we'll get these guys in

1074
01:13:32,830 --> 01:13:37,519
[Laughter]

1075
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:41,840
yeah the problem isn't so much

1076
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:46,640
the thing is it is these leds themselves

1077
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:51,280
here if we can get zoomed in here

1078
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:54,480
is

1079
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:59,600
that i have some that are like

1080
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,800
flat they're kind of an oval shape

1081
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,560
if you can see it here on the you see it

1082
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,719
here on the bottom where this is flat

1083
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:10,000
and this is flat and then

1084
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,960
because these were really expensive i

1085
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,760
just went over to my makerspace

1086
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,960
and got some from there

1087
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:23,920
and let's see if we find one from them

1088
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,600
and so the ones i got from them are

1089
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,560
perfectly round

1090
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:35,600
so you plan a project and

1091
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:38,719
then and then your stuff doesn't come in

1092
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,760
so you have to go get

1093
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,920
borrow stuff from someplace else and of

1094
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:45,440
course it isn't exactly the same stuff

1095
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:49,600
and so that was just something i did not

1096
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:50,560
notice

1097
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,159
so some of these are going to be so

1098
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:53,440
they're not going to be perfectly

1099
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:54,640
straight like they are

1100
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:58,000
on the demo board and at this point i am

1101
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
entirely okay with that

1102
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,679
just as long as they're reasonably flat

1103
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:11,840
i think we're gonna have to move

1104
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:16,159
so it's really just the blues so

1105
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:18,880
it seemed to be the problem so we should

1106
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,159
be good there

1107
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:25,839
we're better there anyway

1108
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:31,840
and now we're going to flip this over

1109
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,920
and get it under the k under the other

1110
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:36,320
camera

1111
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,239
kind of feel around a little bit there

1112
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:40,879
we go okay

1113
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,880
now we're already under the other camera

1114
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:47,120
okay

1115
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:51,520
yes i'm really miss having actual

1116
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,480
physical helpers

1117
01:15:56,239 --> 01:15:58,080
because then i can just record a video

1118
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:01,040
and leave it on a loop

1119
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:05,040
and then have people do this at their

1120
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:07,840
own pace

1121
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,440
with some written instructions and the

1122
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,440
youtube video

1123
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:16,880
much better way to do a soldering

1124
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:21,520
village but this works too

1125
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:24,719
but it is what it is

1126
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:27,599
all right

1127
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:32,480
so we got here 28 okay

1128
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:35,839
and so we're going to go in

1129
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:40,640
and solder in some of these leds

1130
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:44,640
maybe or not

1131
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:52,719
so there's one there's another one

1132
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:57,199
and this one's still on screen

1133
01:16:57,199 --> 01:17:03,839
so let's nudge this up a little bit

1134
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,960
and then we're going to go with this

1135
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:09,360
side

1136
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:13,199
and this side

1137
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,040
and the thing about using these soldered

1138
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,560
breadboards this is that there is

1139
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:19,920
supposed to be

1140
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:20,800
you know you're supposed to have this

1141
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:23,440
little perfect hershey's kiss

1142
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,920
of solder on the backside i have found

1143
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:28,320
that with these soldered breadboards

1144
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:32,080
um your they're taking so much solder

1145
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:35,040
into these oversized holes that as long

1146
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,960
as you get the hole full you're probably

1147
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:40,000
in a good pretty good place

1148
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,600
so then we're going to spin this around

1149
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:45,840
to do the other side

1150
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:59,840
and we'll continue on

1151
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:05,440
and there's that

1152
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:08,640
and there's that

1153
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:13,839
and there's that

1154
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:22,640
and oops we're off camera sorry

1155
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:27,840
there we go

1156
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:43,490
[Laughter]

1157
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:55,839
oh come on these are silicon

1158
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:09,839
there's a big

1159
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:17,840
all right there's that and it looks like

1160
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:21,120
we need a little more in this one

1161
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:25,120
as long as we're back here all right

1162
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:32,960
so there we go

1163
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:37,840
and we'll flip back out

1164
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:05,839
get everything trimmed down here

1165
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:24,000
and there we are and yeah

1166
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:28,080
not quite as neat as the ones that were

1167
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,880
that all had their their sides trimmed

1168
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:32,080
but

1169
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:47,840
it is what it is

1170
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:07,199
all right and we'll do a ready check let

1171
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:08,400
me know when you're done

1172
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:15,839
with your leds

1173
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,160
you

1174
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:32,380
[Music]

1175
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,840
this

1176
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:11,840
so

1177
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:25,840
so

1178
01:22:43,490 --> 01:22:46,580
[Music]

1179
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,840
alright

1180
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:07,840
all right is everybody ready to move on

1181
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:11,360
yes okay

1182
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,800
all right i'm going to assume that if

1183
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,400
the 10 year old is ready then everybody

1184
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:20,320
else should be good so

1185
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,639
where

1186
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,719
okay and so now we have our little

1187
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:29,040
arduino

1188
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:32,639
and we're going to put that on next

1189
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:35,760
and

1190
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,800
we want to make sure

1191
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:43,679
to get all of the pins in at once now

1192
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:45,360
did anybody

1193
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:48,239
get an arduino that did not have these

1194
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:51,599
pins already soldered

1195
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:58,480
nope okay

1196
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:03,600
all right so we're going to attach this

1197
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:06,000
on here

1198
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:12,239
and it's going to go into h and d

1199
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:18,880
and you want to make sure that your red

1200
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:20,560
wire lines up

1201
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:23,520
with d2

1202
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:27,199
there and let me get a good shot of it

1203
01:24:27,199 --> 01:24:31,839
before we even start soldering it

1204
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:41,759
[Music]

1205
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:45,840
okay

1206
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:01,120
okay and

1207
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:10,080
so just a note um

1208
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,760
no there you can see it and let's see if

1209
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:15,600
we can spin it around

1210
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:18,400
because from the wrong angle it looks

1211
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,560
like i'm in d3 but i guess there is a

1212
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:22,159
good angle where we can see that yes

1213
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:23,199
it's in d2

1214
01:25:23,199 --> 01:25:41,839
d3 d4 d5 267 and d8

1215
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:45,760
no actually i cheated and did the

1216
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:47,600
headers before we started because i told

1217
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,760
everybody to buy them with

1218
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:52,560
with pre-soldered headers you can tell

1219
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:55,840
because i didn't put all the headers on

1220
01:26:03,679 --> 01:26:06,000
all right so we're lined up everybody's

1221
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,520
got a good clean shot of what this

1222
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:08,000
should look

1223
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,199
like way up close

1224
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:25,280
and so we're going to flip this over

1225
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:32,229
[Music]

1226
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:36,239
and

1227
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:39,360
so in case you're wondering um

1228
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,280
why i hold the board really weird is

1229
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:42,800
because it's actually easier to

1230
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:45,360
uh find find where i need the camera

1231
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:46,159
angle to be

1232
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:48,800
if i'm right on top of it it's kind of a

1233
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:51,040
muscle memory thing

1234
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:55,920
okay so because this isn't flat

1235
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,440
what you're going to want to do when it

1236
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:00,239
comes to getting these pins on

1237
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:03,280
is we're going to pick a pin and

1238
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:05,280
probably the pin that's absolutely the

1239
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:07,440
easiest to solder

1240
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:11,040
which in my case is going to be

1241
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:16,719
at g1 according to the grid on the board

1242
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:21,360
and we're just going to do this one pin

1243
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:24,320
just the one pin

1244
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:27,920
and what we want to do is we want to

1245
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:30,480
flip it over

1246
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:32,159
and let me get back out into the wide

1247
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:33,280
angle so you can see this a little

1248
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,599
better

1249
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:39,840
and so what we're going to do after we

1250
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:42,000
do our first pin

1251
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,760
is we just want to take a good look at

1252
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:45,199
it

1253
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:48,480
and make sure that it's flat and that

1254
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:51,120
it's level

1255
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,239
because if we only have the one pin we

1256
01:27:56,239 --> 01:27:58,239
can heat up that one pin

1257
01:27:58,239 --> 01:28:00,560
and push it down further into the board

1258
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:02,239
if we need to

1259
01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:05,440
if we do them all that's kind of

1260
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:08,800
out the window so mine appears to be

1261
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:15,760
flat and good

1262
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:19,199
so we'll line that back up

1263
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:28,000
with close-up camera and pop back over

1264
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,320
to that

1265
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:43,840
and we'll drizzle a little flux

1266
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:57,840
and just go to town

1267
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:25,280
um

1268
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:39,840
playing it

1269
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:53,839
i'll just move up a little bit

1270
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:15,600
yeah let's make it that's steady enough

1271
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:21,840
so that's what side a should look like

1272
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:28,880
and now we'll spin it around

1273
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:35,840
and do the b side

1274
01:30:54,159 --> 01:30:56,559
one

1275
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:03,839
and two

1276
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:17,840
um

1277
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:32,719
next

1278
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:38,400
and next

1279
01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:45,840
and next

1280
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:58,560
a little bridge there but as long as

1281
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,239
we're bridging

1282
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:13,839
along the same line we're okay

1283
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:28,639
and we're off camera again

1284
01:32:28,639 --> 01:32:30,960
yay

1285
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:40,719
all right and there's that

1286
01:32:40,719 --> 01:32:42,639
and did i turn this on i did trim this

1287
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:44,960
okay

1288
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:50,400
stay all right so there we go

1289
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:53,600
and we'll get back over to the wide view

1290
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,600
here

1291
01:32:55,600 --> 01:33:00,320
so there it is all soldered in place

1292
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:08,000
nice

1293
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,719
ready to go

1294
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:14,560
and then of course

1295
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:19,920
you can trim those legs

1296
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:21,360
and then we'll go ahead and trim these

1297
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:36,560
little guys off

1298
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:38,080
and i know you don't get to see because

1299
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:40,000
i gotta not throw them all over the

1300
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,320
house

1301
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:51,840
ouch

1302
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:57,120
oh and looks like i missed one

1303
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:02,880
and we'll just figure out that

1304
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:05,840
tap it down

1305
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:24,560
there's another cut and another cut

1306
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:29,199
and another cut another cut

1307
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:31,199
all right bang on that some more all

1308
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:33,839
right

1309
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:47,199
i don't like somebody

1310
01:34:47,199 --> 01:34:48,639
um that's the beautiful thing about

1311
01:34:48,639 --> 01:34:51,840
breadboards if they're a little off

1312
01:34:51,840 --> 01:35:01,840
within reason we're okay

1313
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,560
um yes i have burnt my fingertips enough

1314
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:08,800
not to be afraid of it anymore

1315
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:10,800
um and like i said those two silicon

1316
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:12,400
rings normally i have them on this

1317
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:14,000
finger because i've found

1318
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:18,080
that this is where i usually burn myself

1319
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:24,800
so that's that's the story there

1320
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:26,800
now let's kind of sweep some of that off

1321
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:29,840
the side

1322
01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:36,719
and yes my beautiful pink dot so that i

1323
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:39,600
know where i'm at

1324
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:42,880
directly over the camera

1325
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:46,239
okay so let's finish this up

1326
01:35:46,239 --> 01:35:51,599
for today and get that button going

1327
01:35:52,159 --> 01:35:55,600
okay so the button and the button is

1328
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:56,080
actually

1329
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:59,119
optional you can work without it

1330
01:35:59,119 --> 01:36:01,600
um i like to at least if i'm going to

1331
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:04,000
build an experimental platform i do want

1332
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:04,800
to at least have one

1333
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:08,080
input so this is a 10k pull-up

1334
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:10,000
resistor or this is a 10k resistor we're

1335
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,920
going to use as a pull up

1336
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:14,719
and then here's my fancy button you can

1337
01:36:14,719 --> 01:36:16,400
see it's got a little kind of weird

1338
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:17,840
square

1339
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:19,600
square on there that's because it will

1340
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:21,040
take

1341
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:25,520
it takes a cap

1342
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:28,080
nifty okay so we're going to need our

1343
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:30,000
10k

1344
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,560
our button

1345
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,000
and we're going to use some orange wire

1346
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,679
because we haven't used orange wire yet

1347
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:39,840
and

1348
01:36:40,719 --> 01:36:46,719
so why not okay so for starters

1349
01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:51,360
the button needs to be on four different

1350
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:53,360
each leg of the button needs to be on

1351
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:54,639
its own

1352
01:36:54,639 --> 01:36:58,159
interconnected row so for example

1353
01:36:58,159 --> 01:37:00,960
f through j are all connected on the

1354
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:01,920
bottom

1355
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:03,600
and a through e are all connected on the

1356
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:05,840
bottom so it's got to be

1357
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:09,119
there in between and depending on how

1358
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:10,800
you do it you can move it closer and

1359
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:11,920
farther

1360
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:15,199
um i think on the original on the notes

1361
01:37:15,199 --> 01:37:18,400
i had it at

1362
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:22,400
looks like c19

1363
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:25,839
for the lower left leg

1364
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:29,119
so it was a little closer

1365
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:32,560
we're gonna do 22 just to confuse people

1366
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:35,840
because i can

1367
01:37:36,639 --> 01:37:39,360
so we're going to put our button down

1368
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:41,840
and then the buttons are nice

1369
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:44,000
most of the time their legs are

1370
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,520
pre-formed a little bit

1371
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:46,800
to make them a little bit easier to

1372
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:48,800
solder in place and there's that

1373
01:37:48,800 --> 01:38:02,320
and moving that back over the camera

1374
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:17,520
and we'll fly in to zoom in

1375
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:18,960
and then we're just going to tack down

1376
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:20,639
the four legs

1377
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:25,760
there's one maybe we're not

1378
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:30,719
one two

1379
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:33,520
and the spin

1380
01:38:43,119 --> 01:38:59,839
and three and four

1381
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:04,800
and

1382
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:10,400
there i manually bent a resistor oops

1383
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,639
there you go

1384
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:15,440
another screen there we go and there's

1385
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:18,080
our 10k

1386
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:22,400
and we're going to drop our 10k since we

1387
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:25,280
did our right leg on 24

1388
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:30,239
we're going to drop our 10k onto 24

1389
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:34,559
and bend back the legs

1390
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:43,119
and cube zoom why not

1391
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,280
and we'll drop these in now on the

1392
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:53,199
original

1393
01:39:53,199 --> 01:39:56,239
i had dropped in

1394
01:39:56,239 --> 01:40:00,559
a connector for

1395
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:04,480
to throw our two negative rails together

1396
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,159
on the outside

1397
01:40:06,159 --> 01:40:07,840
and looking at this board a little

1398
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:10,560
closer i really didn't need to

1399
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:14,480
so we are not going to do that this time

1400
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:18,000
just make it a little neater

1401
01:40:18,159 --> 01:40:23,440
oh well

1402
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:27,760
flip it around maybe okay

1403
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:30,800
and we'll go back out

1404
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:37,840
yes

1405
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:54,799
all right

1406
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:04,080
yeah good tip meadow if you don't have a

1407
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:04,719
10k

1408
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:07,920
anything above one

1409
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,679
will do the job we're basically just

1410
01:41:09,679 --> 01:41:12,400
trying not

1411
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:17,199
it's basically a kind of a filter

1412
01:41:17,199 --> 01:41:20,320
it's a pull-up resistor i'm tired ben

1413
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:22,880
help me out

1414
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:28,960
all right so let's so we're going to

1415
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:33,760
take this orange wire here

1416
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:39,119
just like all the others snippy

1417
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:42,480
nippy

1418
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:47,840
twist

1419
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:50,560
twist

1420
01:41:53,440 --> 01:42:01,839
off screen puddle oh good

1421
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:11,360
and that's getting kind of icky so let's

1422
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:14,719
do this

1423
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:19,679
tip icky all right there we go better

1424
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:28,400
and a little solder and a little wire

1425
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:31,519
and a little more wire

1426
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,320
all right

1427
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:43,280
and a bend

1428
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:46,880
and another end and this is going to be

1429
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:49,840
way way too long

1430
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:51,679
so let's figure out how much wire we

1431
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:57,840
actually need here

1432
01:42:59,199 --> 01:43:01,040
and this time i am going to grab a

1433
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:02,719
sharpie

1434
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:07,119
and mark where about where i need the

1435
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:11,840
wire to end

1436
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:14,800
so yeah if you want to get nice and

1437
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:17,440
precise use a sharpie

1438
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:20,879
so we'll cut this way down

1439
01:43:22,159 --> 01:43:25,839
drop this here

1440
01:43:30,239 --> 01:43:35,440
add a little goo from the off-screen goo

1441
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:39,840
puddle

1442
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:46,560
and what's in it there we go

1443
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:53,840
and bend that down

1444
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:04,840
and we're gonna move this over to

1445
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:06,080
because

1446
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:07,760
[Music]

1447
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:11,119
not that fussy in a live demo so there's

1448
01:44:11,119 --> 01:44:13,360
our

1449
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:20,080
lower left leg going to power

1450
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:23,199
i'll get that under the

1451
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:34,930
under the other camera here

1452
01:44:34,930 --> 01:44:38,159
[Music]

1453
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:49,839
and there's one leg

1454
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:57,040
and here's the other

1455
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:02,880
and you can kind of see here again let

1456
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:04,639
me make sure i get this thing

1457
01:45:04,639 --> 01:45:06,719
nicely in frame how this is kind of

1458
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:08,480
bridged with the

1459
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:11,520
leg for the button

1460
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:13,360
um that's okay on this kind of board as

1461
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:16,239
you can see it's all copper down here

1462
01:45:16,239 --> 01:45:18,880
and any solder we add is isn't going to

1463
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:20,000
harm

1464
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:23,040
anything if we had a bridge going

1465
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:26,159
between two of these lines

1466
01:45:26,159 --> 01:45:28,840
that would be an entirely different

1467
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:31,840
story

1468
01:45:34,639 --> 01:45:37,840
that would be very very bad

1469
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:46,400
okay so we've got our button

1470
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:48,400
hooked up now we just have to let the

1471
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:51,440
arduino read it

1472
01:45:53,199 --> 01:45:54,639
and because i have yet to use my

1473
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:57,520
favorite color on this board

1474
01:45:57,520 --> 01:46:00,880
and apparently not on the right

1475
01:46:01,119 --> 01:46:04,719
we're gonna use a purple wire

1476
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:13,199
and i'm just tired punchy enough that if

1477
01:46:13,199 --> 01:46:14,320
i have to i will

1478
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:16,560
sing skull vikings to prove that purple

1479
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:20,000
is my favorite color and why

1480
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:34,080
all right there's one side

1481
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:42,560
and here's the other

1482
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:53,760
and now to self if we go virtual if we

1483
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:56,239
have to go virtual again next year

1484
01:46:56,239 --> 01:46:58,400
we're not going to do all of the builds

1485
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:01,119
on the same day

1486
01:47:01,119 --> 01:47:04,080
by the last one i'm pretty punchy all

1487
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:06,000
right

1488
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:11,199
let's get this solder on here

1489
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:23,840
and some solder on there

1490
01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:28,638
all right

1491
01:47:35,119 --> 01:47:37,920
alrighty who wants to check the

1492
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:39,600
instructions to see if i originally had

1493
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:43,119
this on d9 or d10

1494
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:51,840
ha ha

1495
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:58,480
d10 all right thank you meadow

1496
01:47:58,480 --> 01:48:05,839
all right

1497
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:11,119
all right so we're going from looks like

1498
01:48:11,119 --> 01:48:14,239
about i24

1499
01:48:16,239 --> 01:48:19,839
to j3

1500
01:48:20,719 --> 01:48:22,159
and we got a little bit of rats test

1501
01:48:22,159 --> 01:48:24,480
going

1502
01:48:24,639 --> 01:48:27,119
and

1503
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:33,840
and there we go

1504
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:50,639
and we'll get that under the

1505
01:48:50,639 --> 01:49:01,199
zoomed lens here

1506
01:49:01,199 --> 01:49:04,638
i'll do one side

1507
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:15,840
and then the other

1508
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:22,800
there's one side

1509
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:29,840
and the other and yay

1510
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:46,960
and so now i'm going to flip back over

1511
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:49,920
to the wide angle

1512
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:56,800
and i'm just kind of letting the board

1513
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:58,400
hit the light at different angles

1514
01:49:58,400 --> 01:49:59,920
it makes it a little easier to see if

1515
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:02,719
i've accidentally bridged anything

1516
01:50:02,719 --> 01:50:05,280
or anything that looks like it might

1517
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:06,639
need a little more solder

1518
01:50:06,639 --> 01:50:11,840
or reflowed

1519
01:50:14,159 --> 01:50:16,880
so not great not terrible should be

1520
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:19,520
serviceable

1521
01:50:23,199 --> 01:50:28,719
so okay there's our project

1522
01:50:28,719 --> 01:50:31,520
and wow i started late and i still have

1523
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:34,000
a couple minutes to spare so yay

1524
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:39,840
um so that's our project

1525
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:49,679
we'll go ahead and we'll walk through

1526
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:51,840
programming tomorrow um

1527
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:56,080
if you want to try try it tonight

1528
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:58,080
um because i know i know there's a

1529
01:50:58,080 --> 01:51:00,239
closing keynote and then a social hour

1530
01:51:00,239 --> 01:51:03,599
and and then after that that with almost

1531
01:51:03,599 --> 01:51:06,320
everybody being at home it's

1532
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:08,719
not as long of a party or as much fun

1533
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:09,360
but

1534
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:12,560
anyway it is what it is um

1535
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:14,480
do go ahead and try it um if you look at

1536
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:16,560
the arduino ide

1537
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:18,480
um there's two sketches that'll let you

1538
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:20,159
test these things

1539
01:51:20,159 --> 01:51:22,639
and i'm just going to run through quick

1540
01:51:22,639 --> 01:51:23,760
how to change them

1541
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:26,960
for these boards i'm not going to load

1542
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:28,320
them

1543
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:30,880
do we need to run the power oh why yes

1544
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:33,040
john we do need to run the power

1545
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:36,560
so let's actually not look at the ide

1546
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:38,719
and actually thank you very much john

1547
01:51:38,719 --> 01:51:40,239
for reminding me

1548
01:51:40,239 --> 01:51:44,400
because you're awesome and i've been

1549
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:48,800
at this workbench way too long today

1550
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:52,080
so we're going to need a red wire

1551
01:52:01,199 --> 01:52:06,799
and so we're gonna take the red wire

1552
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:10,080
and i'm gonna zoom in here to show you

1553
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:17,840
where it goes

1554
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:23,040
okay so if we look at

1555
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:25,599
the bottom right corner of the arduino

1556
01:52:25,599 --> 01:52:27,360
we have these pins down here that are

1557
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:29,280
mysteriously marked

1558
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:34,480
5v rst gnd and vin

1559
01:52:39,679 --> 01:52:41,520
the black wire joining both negative

1560
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:43,520
rails we can actually leave

1561
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:45,280
and as soon as i'm done connecting the

1562
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:48,719
power on the ground i'll show you why

1563
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:54,639
okay so back here so what we need to do

1564
01:52:54,639 --> 01:52:56,800
is we need to provide the leds with five

1565
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:57,440
volts

1566
01:52:57,440 --> 01:53:00,719
so we're going to use this 5v pin

1567
01:53:00,719 --> 01:53:03,360
and hook that into the positive rail or

1568
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:05,280
the plus rail

1569
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:07,599
on

1570
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:13,840
on there

1571
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:22,719
so let's tin one end

1572
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:24,560
give it a little bend and i'm sorry i'm

1573
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:26,960
doing some of these things

1574
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:28,480
the way i would if i didn't have an

1575
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:31,040
audience

1576
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:41,840
so this one we're going to mark up again

1577
01:53:45,599 --> 01:53:49,679
go away all right

1578
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:55,679
and let's

1579
01:53:55,679 --> 01:53:58,880
fade out a little bit here we go and so

1580
01:53:58,880 --> 01:53:59,840
we're back to

1581
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:02,159
cut

1582
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,320
okay we're gonna start at square one

1583
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:08,000
because i was on the wrong camera and i

1584
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:11,440
just messed up my wire so if we got our

1585
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:13,199
length of red wire

1586
01:54:13,199 --> 01:54:17,280
we're gonna take one end strip it

1587
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:19,920
twist it

1588
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:25,280
and tin it and my puddle's almost dry

1589
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:27,679
all right

1590
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:30,740
and there we go there

1591
01:54:30,740 --> 01:54:33,800
[Music]

1592
01:54:34,159 --> 01:54:36,159
and that's not quite perfect so we'll

1593
01:54:36,159 --> 01:54:37,599
just trim off a little bit

1594
01:54:37,599 --> 01:54:41,040
all right and we're going to go back to

1595
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:50,880
the 5-volt

1596
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:55,199
oh come on you stupid piece of it

1597
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:05,679
and there's that and that

1598
01:55:06,639 --> 01:55:09,199
and that

1599
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:14,480
and our friendly blue sharpie

1600
01:55:15,119 --> 01:55:18,080
okay let's not cut on the sharpie line

1601
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:18,719
again

1602
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:22,560
let's cut past the sharpie line

1603
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:27,360
and instead strip to the sharpie line

1604
01:55:27,599 --> 01:55:33,840
all right

1605
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:47,840
okay

1606
01:55:54,159 --> 01:56:01,839
all right

1607
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:15,119
some smooch on there all right

1608
01:56:15,119 --> 01:56:17,360
and so i've just made another little

1609
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:18,400
wire like

1610
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:22,000
all the others yay

1611
01:56:23,199 --> 01:56:26,840
and we're gonna go positive two it looks

1612
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:28,000
like

1613
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,719
row 12 column 12 however you want to

1614
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:33,199
look at it

1615
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:37,519
12 c and positive rail

1616
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:43,040
and let's get that focus

1617
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:48,480
and let's see what haven't we used yet

1618
01:56:51,679 --> 01:56:55,440
there reverse slide why not

1619
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:57,839
okay

1620
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:05,599
and we'll go positive real first

1621
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:11,840
and then up in here

1622
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:16,400
all right

1623
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:25,839
trim off the little tag

1624
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:29,599
and we'll trim off the little tag

1625
01:57:29,599 --> 01:57:34,680
and lay excess there and that looks good

1626
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:36,639
[Music]

1627
01:57:36,639 --> 01:57:38,080
and then we're going to find some black

1628
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:39,679
wire

1629
01:57:39,679 --> 01:57:42,239
black wire

1630
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:47,119
and take that

1631
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:52,480
and that's

1632
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:55,440
and twist

1633
01:57:57,920 --> 01:58:07,840
and then this one is

1634
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:11,760
and wipe and what we're really going to

1635
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:14,159
go here for the black wire

1636
01:58:14,159 --> 01:58:17,520
is um ground

1637
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:19,360
and there's actually more than one

1638
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:20,719
ground

1639
01:58:20,719 --> 01:58:22,080
on this board but we're going to use

1640
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:25,920
this one there's one on the other side

1641
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:28,400
i think and i think there's a third one

1642
01:58:28,400 --> 01:58:30,480
if i would remember where it is

1643
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:31,840
i know there's at least three on an

1644
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:34,639
arduino uno

1645
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:37,920
that that last pin

1646
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:41,199
next to ground is vin

1647
01:58:41,199 --> 01:58:44,400
it's voltage in so if you were going to

1648
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:46,639
say use

1649
01:58:46,639 --> 01:58:50,480
double a batteries four of them

1650
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:54,159
to to power this um instead of say

1651
01:58:54,159 --> 01:58:56,239
a little like lipstick charger or just

1652
01:58:56,239 --> 01:58:58,560
leaving it plugged in on your desk

1653
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:02,320
um you would want to put there because

1654
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:03,040
that will take

1655
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:06,400
unregulated voltage whereas the 5 volt

1656
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:07,040
pin

1657
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:09,920
is actually an out

1658
01:59:11,599 --> 01:59:14,480
whereas the power coming in on the usb

1659
01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:17,040
port is actually regulated

1660
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:20,159
so fun times

1661
01:59:20,159 --> 01:59:24,639
and so i'm not even anywhere okay

1662
01:59:24,639 --> 01:59:26,480
there you go and you'd see it coming in

1663
01:59:26,480 --> 01:59:29,040
and let me pan back out

1664
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:34,000
we're cut back out there we go and

1665
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:45,839
too long

1666
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:52,560
oh there we go

1667
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:59,840
and spin and there we go

1668
02:00:00,239 --> 02:00:02,480
and let's make sure that this fits

1669
02:00:02,480 --> 02:00:05,440
before we tin it

1670
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:08,719
so ground

1671
02:00:10,639 --> 02:00:13,840
and that could be a little shorter

1672
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:40,719
um

1673
02:00:40,719 --> 02:00:55,679
okay all right

1674
02:00:55,679 --> 02:00:59,199
okay this should be good so magical

1675
02:00:59,199 --> 02:00:59,679
puddle

1676
02:00:59,679 --> 02:01:09,840
off screen

1677
02:01:18,719 --> 02:01:20,159
and we did not get this through the

1678
02:01:20,159 --> 02:01:22,239
magical puddle enough let's

1679
02:01:22,239 --> 02:01:26,480
try that again there we go that's better

1680
02:01:30,719 --> 02:01:37,199
all right

1681
02:01:37,199 --> 02:01:38,560
so there we go and we're just going to

1682
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:40,800
trim these down return these down a

1683
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:42,239
little bit

1684
02:01:42,239 --> 02:01:45,119
they're kind of long

1685
02:01:46,239 --> 02:01:48,840
and so this is going to go from ground

1686
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:50,080
gnd

1687
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:54,719
into the negative rail

1688
02:01:55,599 --> 02:01:59,360
and bend and bend

1689
02:01:59,360 --> 02:02:05,839
and bend that way there we go

1690
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:11,520
yeah fly all right

1691
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:16,800
all right and there's our last two

1692
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:20,080
connections for the evening

1693
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:25,599
coming right up and then we'll explain

1694
02:02:25,599 --> 02:02:27,679
why we don't need that black wire that

1695
02:02:27,679 --> 02:02:33,840
we saw that you saw in the prototype

1696
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,560
so there's that one and let's the other

1697
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:38,800
end

1698
02:02:39,040 --> 02:02:47,840
oh good god there it is

1699
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:01,840
and

1700
02:03:06,719 --> 02:03:14,080
all right so

1701
02:03:14,080 --> 02:03:15,760
now the reason we don't need the black

1702
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:19,440
wire is that when i built the prototype

1703
02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:21,920
i did the black wire out of habit i had

1704
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:25,040
i didn't really look at the board i just

1705
02:03:25,040 --> 02:03:27,199
i just out of habit connected the two

1706
02:03:27,199 --> 02:03:28,159
negative

1707
02:03:28,159 --> 02:03:32,159
rails afterwards

1708
02:03:32,159 --> 02:03:35,280
when i looked at it i realized that

1709
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:37,119
the outside here which is the negative

1710
02:03:37,119 --> 02:03:38,320
rail on

1711
02:03:38,320 --> 02:03:41,679
the one side is actually all the way

1712
02:03:41,679 --> 02:03:43,840
around

1713
02:03:43,840 --> 02:03:46,880
and through on both sides

1714
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:48,960
um it does look like we are going to

1715
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:52,239
need to do one little thing though

1716
02:03:52,239 --> 02:03:53,679
and that is we are going to need to

1717
02:03:53,679 --> 02:03:56,560
bridge here

1718
02:03:56,560 --> 02:03:58,560
is that we are going to need to bridge

1719
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:00,400
yeah this one

1720
02:04:00,400 --> 02:04:01,599
is that we are going to need to bridge

1721
02:04:01,599 --> 02:04:03,440
that one side

1722
02:04:03,440 --> 02:04:07,199
but that's going to be a little easier

1723
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:14,560
than having to add more wires

1724
02:04:14,560 --> 02:04:17,440
so we take this

1725
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:19,440
and you just put down a big glob of

1726
02:04:19,440 --> 02:04:21,839
solder

1727
02:04:22,639 --> 02:04:24,810
and if you're lucky you can get it too

1728
02:04:24,810 --> 02:04:26,079
[Music]

1729
02:04:26,079 --> 02:04:27,840
oh sure first time all day i can get

1730
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:29,440
some debris that i wanted to bridge

1731
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:34,400
all right that makes my life awesome

1732
02:04:36,639 --> 02:04:38,000
you kind of put down a big door of the

1733
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,079
solder here

1734
02:04:40,079 --> 02:04:43,280
fine okay so and if it's

1735
02:04:43,280 --> 02:04:46,079
not bridging

1736
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:50,400
um you can add a little piece of wire

1737
02:04:50,480 --> 02:04:52,400
or actually even use like one of these

1738
02:04:52,400 --> 02:04:56,079
it's a leg from one of the leds

1739
02:04:56,079 --> 02:04:57,760
i probably have a little too much flux

1740
02:04:57,760 --> 02:05:00,880
here to get it to bridge right

1741
02:05:04,239 --> 02:05:08,959
yeah it's not going to too much flux

1742
02:05:12,079 --> 02:05:15,760
so bridge it up a little bit

1743
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:20,480
nope all fine

1744
02:05:20,480 --> 02:05:22,000
we'll show this on the other side where

1745
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,920
it's dry

1746
02:05:23,920 --> 02:05:26,239
you just kind of drag a little bit in

1747
02:05:26,239 --> 02:05:28,000
between

1748
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:32,719
and it should connect if it doesn't

1749
02:05:33,679 --> 02:05:36,159
connect

1750
02:05:36,719 --> 02:05:40,159
you can actually cheat it

1751
02:05:41,599 --> 02:05:44,480
by just grabbing the leftover bit from

1752
02:05:44,480 --> 02:05:45,119
say

1753
02:05:45,119 --> 02:05:49,839
a resistor or an led

1754
02:05:53,599 --> 02:05:56,000
like that
