hone your interviewing skills and

121
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,400
i'm going to be focusing on what i call

122
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,919
the big three which are

123
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,919
the three biggest reasons that companies

124
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,960
really struggle

125
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,199
to get the people that they want and

126
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,400
attract the people that

127
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,040
they want so the the three areas that

128
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,040
the mistakes and gaps

129
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,160
in a job description the interview

130
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,360
process

131
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,479
and offer time and i'm a big believer in

132
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,440
lots of kissing

133
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,320
through the whole of all processes keep

134
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,520
it simple

135
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,040
um so it's it's so important we complex

136
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,840
we complicate

137
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,840
far too many things and we really don't

138
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,440
need to so just remember

139
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,400

longer to get back to them
