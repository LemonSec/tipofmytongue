1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,319
hi it's chris rides here from tyro

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:05,440
security

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,359
uh this is video two we've done in

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,599
partnership with the diana initiative

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,599
it's to help hiring managers

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,679
try and stop the bottlenecks that they

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:14,799
might be uh

8
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,680
finding in their hiring process so this

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,880
is the second video

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,640
and it's actually covering the interview

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,960
process

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,599
so i've got a saying i've kind of

13
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:26,640
adapted from

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,160
from something that we see commonly in

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,080
recruitment and i call it time

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,600
kills all fields so what does that mean

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,800
a long poor quality interview process

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,200
that results in candidates that think

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,640
you're not keen on them

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,480
results in candidates that take another

21
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,800
job before they can get to your final

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,840
stages

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,520
candidates that end up with multiple

24
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,680
officer offers and lots of processes

25
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,640
going on

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,840
um which can can completely change what

27
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,559
they

28
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,079
required or what they were looking for

29
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,680
at the beginning of your process

30
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,520
and what they're now looking for things

31
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,879
like salary

32
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,920
um other benefits also

33
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,000
it can also cause you know you'll take a

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,760
lot of time you can then have a lot more

35
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,439
to think about and all of a sudden

36
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,119
you're delaying your hiring and that

37
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,479
might mean that you

38
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,479
don't get your first choice and you miss

39
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:15,759
out on your second and third choice

40
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:16,880
candidates

41
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,560
and so we're going to focus on these

42
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,000
three things

43
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,600
it's going to be focusing on who

44
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,159
interviews going to focus on

45
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,320
how do they interview and then how do

46
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,520
you go around gathering feedback

47
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,439
so talk about interview panels um

48
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,880
i think it's really important that

49
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,200
they're very lean i've got to say in the

50
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,360
20 years i've been in recruitment

51
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,960
it was very common for me to see

52
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,520
processes with just one or two

53
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,920
interview people interviewing literally

54
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,799
two people on

55
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,720
on the interview panel two of them said

56
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,560
yes they bring people in

57
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,320
now it seems much more common to see

58
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,799
maybe four five six different people

59
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,759
interviewing even for non-exec positions

60
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,040
and and i think if

61
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,280
if people were if we were seeing that

62
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,880
people were staying longer in their

63
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,000
positions now

64
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,600
we'd be saying i can understand why

65
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,679
that's happening but the fact is we're

66
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,640
not seeing any any sort of increases in

67
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,959
how long people stay in jobs so

68
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,520
you know i i like to talk about keeping

69
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,640
your interview panel

70
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,120
as lean as possible so if they don't

71
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,480
need to be on the panel

72
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,280
they shouldn't be on the panel if this

73
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,480
is part of

74
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,239
somebody's role growing and you want

75
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,840
them to be part of the interview process

76
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,400
because

77
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,760
they're going to be doing that as part

78
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,440
of their their role at some point you

79
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,800
see them

80
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,560
as somebody that should be involved

81
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,560
that's great but until they're ready to

82
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,840
do an interview on your own

83
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,120
they should maybe just sit in with

84
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,120
somebody else's and and

85
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,480
and do that rather than adding an

86
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,160
additional interview stage

87
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,959
and also if you've got people in your

88
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,080
interview panel

89
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,599
that have very little time for

90
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,920
interviewing you should really think

91
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,400
about

92
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,239
alternatives to that person you know

93
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,440
they're clearly a very

94
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,200
very busy and because the delays that

95
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,120
they can cause

96
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,760
can cause real big issues remember time

97
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,319
kills

98
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,800
all fields and be very aware of extra

99
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,000
people on the panel

100
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
the more people you have on the panel

101
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,360
the less likelihood you're going to get

102
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,319
100

103
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,640
agreement across the board that every

104
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,560
person likes that person

105
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,159
and it's more likely that you're gonna

106
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,239
end up with either no hire at all

107
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,000
and sometimes we see companies come to

108
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,440
us and they've been looking for nine

109
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,400
months and

110
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,239
often it's when we sit down these are

111
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,519
the first things we go through the

112
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,480
processes

113
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,519
we see issues and and

114
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,799
so it can cause no higher at all or

115
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,840
you get a higher and that higher hasn't

116
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,000
got everybody's 100 buy-in because

117
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,840
you've gone with the majority

118
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,760
are you really setting that person up

119
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,599
for success are they going to come in

120
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,120
and work with the team

121
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,000
and do well with somebody there who's

122
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,560
thinking well i said no to this person

123
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,560
and you know do you want somebody that's

124
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,720
like i told you so i told them you told

125
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,000
you they wouldn't work out so

126
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
just bear that in mind let's keep it as

127
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,200
lean as possible

128
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,799
cut through do you really need all those

129
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,560
people on the panel so

130
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,480
once you've got that you then got to

131
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,000
think about what are those people

132
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,879
interview for

133
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,400
so each individual person you've got

134
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,480
what are they interviewing for

135
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,000
look at your essentials on the job

136
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,440
description we did that in the last

137
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,160
video

138
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,000
look at the essentials what are they

139
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,358
interviewing for

140
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,800
this person is interviewing for this

141
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,320
this person is interviewing for this

142
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,400
these two people both interview for this

143
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,080
do you need both of them on there so

144
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,520
start thinking about that

145
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,680
do they understand what they are

146
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,520
interviewing for

147
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,199
um are they all in the same page have

148
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,120
you actually had your whole interview

149
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,199
panel in a meeting and discussed

150
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,400
what's going to happen during that

151
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,919
interview have you discussed well this

152
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,199
person is going to be interviewing for

153
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:43,759
this

154
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,120
this person is going to be interviewing

155
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,320
for this are they all on the same page

156
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,240
have you actually discussed the plan be

157
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,840
surprised how many times people have not

158
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,120
actually done that

159
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,560
so remember as i always say kiss kiss

160
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,040
kiss

161
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,240
keep it simple

162
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,400
so you're thinking about the quality of

163
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,840
your interview process

164
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,320
and and also the quality of the people

165
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,919
interviewing how do they interview

166
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,320
so just remember when they you know when

167
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,000
do they actually interview

168
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,440
have you got the people in the right

169
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,320
order nothing worse than the candidate

170
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,800
or yourself even going through wasting

171
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,400
all this time both your time the

172
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,680
candidate's time going through all of

173
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,560
this process

174
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,720
only to find at the end that it's a no

175
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,320
and it's a no for something that should

176
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,360
have been picked up right at the

177
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,080
beginning

178
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,320
so have you got people in the right

179
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,840
order doing their interviews

180
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,840
right this could save you a lot of time

181
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,120
and it's you've got to think about your

182
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,120
branding and what it says about company

183
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,600
when

184
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,039
people get right the way to the end and

185
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,039
it doesn't work out right also

186
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,080
how do these people interview you this

187
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,600
is such a common issue

188
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,440
and hiring managers

189
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,199
don't like there's a lot of assuming

190
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,639
going on there's a lot of assuming

191
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,960
this is how my colleague interviews they

192
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,160
don't actually know

193
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,160
so as the hiring manager this person's

194
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,360
gonna work for you

195
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,000
have you sat in on an interview with

196
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,960
every single

197
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,840
person on your interview panel if not

198
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,880
why not

199
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,240
you should know exactly how the

200
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,280
interview should know what they're

201
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,319
interviewing for

202
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,680
and you should do that on a regular

203
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,680
basis you don't need to sit in everyone

204
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,199
but you know whether that's if you're

205
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,199
depending on how often you're hiring

206
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,360
you know should that be once a month you

207
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,639
know how often is it but you should

208
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,199
definitely

209
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,880
do that because it does change and

210
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,880
people interview one way in front of you

211
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,800
and then you know give it a couple of

212
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,479
months they might change their interview

213
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,479
style or the questions they're asking

214
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,919
and so it's really important that you

215
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,800
see it on the interviews it can bring

216
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,759
absolutely eye-opening results you know

217
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,680
it's really common to see duplication of

218
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,400
areas

219
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,000
two people interviewing for exactly the

220
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,360
same thing when they're not supposed to

221
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,880
that's not what you discussed

222
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,039
maybe somebody interviewing for one area

223
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,120
and then just going completely off into

224
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,639
a completely different area like a

225
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,160
completely different topic

226
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,360
and not even covering the area they

227
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,800
originally agreed to

228
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,319
and inappropriate questions you know

229
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,120
questions that

230
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,199
hr certainly wouldn't like to know of

231
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,360
being asked and lawyers

232
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,039
love that they're being asked so just

233
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,120
bear that in mind

234
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,560
so last part feedback you know

235
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,560
fast in-depth feedback this is what you

236
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,680
should be looking at

237
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,520
now when you book an hour of somebody's

238
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,199
time to do an interview are you booking

239
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,800
15 minutes straight afterwards

240
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,960
for them to take the time to give the

241
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,160
feedback while it's

242
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,080
fresh in their mind and whether that's

243
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,599
following whatever pro

244
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,400
process your company actually has and

245
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,919
you want to make sure you get detailed

246
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,360
feedback and you want to have the time

247
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,720
you don't want them to think

248
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,800
four days later what was it that was

249
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,880
that person i've actually had feedback

250
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,680
come

251
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,160
from the wrong person because they're

252
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,440
getting mixed up

253
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,879
you know because they've interviewed so

254
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,240
many people they're mixing up the

255
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,800
interview

256
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,160
so it's really important that the

257
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,400
feedback times booked

258
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,599
to do that we constantly see

259
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,960
people on the interview panel give

260
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,800
really superficial feedback

261
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,360
not in depth and that often take days to

262
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,639
actually give it

263
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,479
you know in-depth feedback whether it's

264
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,000
positive or negative

265
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,440
is really useful for recruiters hr

266
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,280
for people to do a better job by you to

267
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,280
make sure that you get people that

268
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,960
are better fit for what you're looking

269
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,960
for so it's really important that

270
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,520
your feedback is given in depth even

271
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,479
positive feedback

272
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,080
positive feedback's so hard to get in

273
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,160
depth just to tell really like this

274
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,520
about this person

275
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,800
this is what we discussed on their

276
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,560
resume it was really interesting it's a

277
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,840
great fit for this

278
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,919
you know just make sure that you know

279
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,240
you're you you do give that detailed

280
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,039
feedback

281
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,200
speed's really important so that kind of

282
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,640
moves us on to getting it to the

283
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,200
candidate quickly as well

284
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,880
you've got to ensure what your company

285
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,839
processes for giving feedback

286
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,519
who gives the feedback how does it

287
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,959
happen when does it happen

288
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,640
you want to make sure there are absolute

289
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,720
minimal delays between

290
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,399
getting that feedback and giving it to

291
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,080
the candidate and moving the process

292
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,200
on right we've seen candidates lost

293
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,760
both from the interviewers not getting

294
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,640
their feedback

295
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,640
quickly enough to hr you know we speak

296
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,959
to hr and internal recruiters baby

297
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,120
and they're telling us we still not

298
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,480
heard from this person well we're

299
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,480
talking to the hiring manager or cso and

300
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,160
they haven't had the feedback yet

301
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,160
so it's really important you emphasize

302
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,720
how the feedback comes very quickly

303
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,200
likewise we've seen feedback where we

304
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,959
get told the feedback's been passed to

305
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,000
hr and they'll get

306
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,480
back to you and you know a day two days

307
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,399
later we're hearing the feedback in some

308
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,480
cases it's actually positive feedback

309
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,080
which is just insane this is something

310
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,600
you need to do quickly

311
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,880
right quick feedback especially when

312
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,720
it's positive makes candidates feel

313
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,839
wanted

314
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,040
right and the opposite's true when

315
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,560
you know the exact opposite is true when

316
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,120
you're you're delaying that feedback

317
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,880
so you know remember let's get it done

318
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,399
let's get it done quickly

319
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,959
and the industry is very very small

320
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:53,440
right

321
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,800
every interview your team

322
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,640
your company you as an individual

323
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,360
is you know you're being looked at by

324
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,079
that candidate

325
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,519
and that can that's going to tell other

326
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,040
candidates going to tell other people in

327
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,760
the industry

328
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,440
what it was like to be interviewed by

329
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,880
you so you've got to think of that when

330
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,720
you're going through this process

331
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,200
so look that's the end of video two

332
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,160
don't forget

333
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,000

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,519
me make sure you put something

341
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,959
in the note that you know you've seen

342
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,640
this talk and

343
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,079
you know something along those lines i

344
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,800
get a lot of junk as i'm sure everybody

345
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,120
else does you know a lot of people

346
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,680
that want to connect that you know are

347
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,040
trying to do all sorts of things

348
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,000
probably nefarious

349
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,920
stuff as well bearing in mind that i run

350
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,920
a cyber security company so i have to be

351
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,720
very careful

352
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,480
so just take time bit time and put a

353
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,560
note in there you can also check out our
