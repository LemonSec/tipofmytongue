an interview this is one of my favorite

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,200
topics because

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,839
it's such a commonly asked question with

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,440
my candidates and it's also

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,279
really fun for me to be able to help

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,680
people be as successful as possible in

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,920

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,920
interview let's talk about

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,640
um how to get through that one to five

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,800
rounds of interviews before

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,559
the offer stage which i hope you get

18
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,239

19
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,520

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,559
preparation is absolutely crucial it

21
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,640
could make or break your success

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,520
and um all of these things that i'm

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,280
covering today are basically

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,320
uh helping you vamp up your interview

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,559
skills so number one i would say

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,039
probably the first thing i would do in

27
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,480
terms of getting ready for

28
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,760
a new interview is preparation research

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,840
the company

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,080
read the company's website start there

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,240
get as much information as you can about

32
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,280
the ceo

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,360
and the cso um google the company and

34
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,360
then click on the news tab

35
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,759
on google and see if there's any recent

36
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,280
news anything that might be

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,720
relevant something that you can bring up

38
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,720
in your interview something that you can

39
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,040
use to sound informed and to show that

40
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,119
you've done your research this is

41
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,479
really huge a lot of kind of

42
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,880
you know interview questions tend to be

43
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,400
what do you know about our company and

44
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,200
you want to be

45
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,360
really you don't necessarily need to

46
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,360
give a laundry list but you want to be

47
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,840
conversational about the company show

48
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,280
that you've done your research

49
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,680
show that you're interested another

50
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,439
really great resource is to go onto

51
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,479
linkedin

52
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,600
and look at the company profile and your

53
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,280
interviewer's profile

54
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,560
so a lot of candidates get a little

55
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,799
squeamish about clicking on someone's

56
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,079
profile because

57
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,639
they might see that you viewed them that

58
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,520
is

59
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,840
not at all inappropriate so sorry for

60
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,120
the double negative it is totally

61
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,160
appropriate

62
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,239
to use linkedin to internet stalk

63
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,840
appropriately um your interviewer that's

64
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,800
what linkedin is for

65
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,800
it's a professional resource online

66
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,520
public tool that everyone can use this

67
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,480
way

68
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,840
also look at the wikipedia history and

69
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,440
often companies will have a youtube

70
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,959
channel sometimes you'll even get a tour

71
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,640
of the inside of the office and see how

72
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,239
people are dressed and

73
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,959
what the office looks like um these are

74
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,480
all great ways to get a sense

75
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,720
for how businessy you need to look for

76
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,160
your interview if it's a zoom

77
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,680
call or you know

78
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,360
other you might find all kinds of

79
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,800
interesting information there

80
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,519
i would say big tip do not look at glass

81
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,000
door

82
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,480
reviews before before your interview

83
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,400
there's a lot of research that suggests

84
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,319
that people are more likely to heed

85
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,920
negative advice or negative reviews

86
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,640
and on top of that people are more

87
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,760
likely to leave

88
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,840
a negative review when they're upset

89
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,760
than a positive review when they're

90
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,400
happy

91
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,840
so this these reviews

92
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,159
tend to put kind of a negative skew on

93
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,120
things

94
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,920
i don't think it's really positive or

95
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,959
beneficial

96
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,319
i would say go through with the

97
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,000
interview process

98
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,480
see how you feel about the interviewer

99
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,760
about the company

100
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,000
about the opportunity with the

101
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,680
opportunity to discuss it

102
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,640
face to face with a human being before

103
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,000
you even look at those things

104
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,280
if you even decide to at all um as you

105
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,120
do this research

106
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,440
make notes as you go along of any

107
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,280
questions that come up for you

108
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,120
about the company the role the culture

109
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,000
the team the hiring manager upcoming

110
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,720
projects

111
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,879
all of that as you're going because you

112
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,159
really want to be prepared

113
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,239
with great questions that you can ask

114
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,000
that those make you a memorable

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,360
candidate

116
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,680
so next i would say read the job

117
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,120
description

118
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,000
if you have a printer print it make

119
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,238
notes on the job description

120
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,120
i would even suggest that you make a

121
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,759
note of

122
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,800
every applicable skill that you have on

123
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,320
the job description

124
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,800
and even give an example these are all

125
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,400
just notes for yourself to kind of get

126
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,560
your juices flowing and thinking about

127
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,639
how talented you actually are and how

128
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,000
skilled you actually are

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,520
these things can help you to feel a

130
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,440
little bit more focused and less

131
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,080
nervous in your interview and then

132
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,199
giving examples

133
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,639
of these specific skills and tools

134
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,120
projects those kinds of things on the

135
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,080
job description

136
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,919
you can then have it in front of you for

137
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,479
the interview and glance down at it

138
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,759
as a reference if you get a brain fog

139
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,160
or get so nervous that you forget what

140
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,199
you're going to say

141
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,600
it happens to me literally all the time

142
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,440
and then i would also say

143
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,919
the next step of preparation print your

144
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:12,560
resume

145
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,560
or have it on a screen next to you maybe

146
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,600
you um

147
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,039
have two screens that you could have

148
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,960
these things pulled up on print your

149
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,600
resume

150
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,199
and reference that you want to review

151
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,120
your work history beforehand

152
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,520
as well make sure that what you say

153
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,520
matches what's on your resume

154
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,919
so reference it during your interview to

155
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,520
answer any questions about your

156
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,560
experience

157
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,639
so that you don't misremember your dates

158
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,080
or leave something out

159
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,520
because you're nervous i also recommend

160
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,039
going through your resume and thinking

161
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,880
about previous work experience

162
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,440
and how it ties into the job description

163
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,720
that you just read

164
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,639
you can make notes on the resume if

165
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,639
you've printed it as well

166
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,680
writing one to maybe three examples

167
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,759
of specific things that you've

168
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,960
accomplished

169
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,240
or statistics it's a great idea to be

170
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,759
able to give some numbers

171
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,880
about a percentage of abundant

172
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,319
with a specific tool or um

173
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,600
you know any kind of kpis or any

174
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,479
different relevant skills that you have

175
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,160
or how you

176
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,440
improved workflow those kinds of things

177
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,759
and then on the topic of forgetting

178
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,680
because you're nervous

179
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,199
have a notepad and pen handy

180
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,680
so that you can make notes of questions

181
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,039
that they've asked you

182
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,520
and any information that they give you

183
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,440
that's really pertinent to the job

184
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,520
because chances are when the interview

185
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,039
is over and the adrenaline

186
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,000
rush wears off not everyone has that but

187
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,199
many people do

188
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,199
chances are that if the adrenaline wears

189
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,960
off you'll have forgotten most of what

190
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,680
was said

191
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,720
or at least enough of it that maybe some

192
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,319
important information about

193
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,800
the team culture or little details about

194
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,319
your interviewer

195
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,720
um you know what their dog's name is

196
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,319
anything like that that they share with

197
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,360
you make a note

198
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,599
because these are all very ways that you

199
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,520
can be more personable in your follow-up

200
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,960
and then finally practice

201
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,080
your interview questions

202
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,080
go through there are a ton of resources

203
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,520
online

204
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,400
of different common interview questions

205
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,680
practice practice practice sit alone

206
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,440
in your apartment and talk to your house

207
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:31,919
plant

208
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,039
or record yourself and watch it

209
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,759
but don't be too critical maybe pay

210
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,240
attention to how many times you say um

211
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,199
i'm trying really hard not to right now

212
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,720
so then

213
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,800
as you research the company and jot down

214
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,759
your questions

215
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,160
this is going any questions that you ask

216
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,919
are going to show that you've done

217
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,960
your research you want them to be based

218
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,520
on

219
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,520
your goals you want your questions

220
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,080
to be about your interview performance

221
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,520
and next steps

222
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,960
so ask about team culture about upcoming

223
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,319
projects

224
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,520
career growth potential performance

225
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,400
expectations what a typical day looks

226
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,680
like in this job

227
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,840
if someone else held this position

228
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,840
before you or if it's a new position

229
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,520
that you would be filling for the first

230
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,840
time

231
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,759
um you know ask a few questions directed

232
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,000
at the interviewer if you get time

233
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,880
anything work related of course so maybe

234
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,679
ask them

235
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,279
how long they've been with the company

236
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,200
but if you've taken my advice and looked

237
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,719
at their linkedin profile

238
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,000
you know how long they've been at the

239
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,760
company so maybe you can ask something a

240
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,880
bit more specific

241
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,720
ask them what they absolutely love about

242
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,920
working there

243
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,640
what drew them to the company what how

244
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:48,959
they

245
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,120
see you fitting in on the team now that

246
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,720
they've spoken with you

247
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,680
but probably the most important question

248
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,720
that i recommend

249
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,399
that you ask is are there any gaps

250
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,720
in answers that i've given you today to

251
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,560
any of these questions

252
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,360
or any gaps on my resume that i can

253
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,320
clarify

254
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,560
while we're still on this call this is

255
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,680
so big because

256
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,720
if you can address any of those problems

257
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,240
while they're still on the phone with

258
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,959
you or on a zoom call with you

259
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,839
then you are more likely to get moved on

260
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,040
to the next step

261
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,560
maybe you thought you answered a

262
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,240
question thoroughly and they felt that

263
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,600
it was a bit vague

264
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,760
or maybe you accidentally said the

265
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,120
opposite of what you meant

266
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,760
it happens when we get nervous so don't

267
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,800
hesitate

268
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,959
to just address it while you still have

269
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,599
them on the phone

270
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,680
okay so if you are

271
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,600
doing a phone interview i have some

272
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
advice for you on both of these points

273
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,720
so let's talk about first

274
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,880
impressions you've already made your

275
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,399
first impression

276
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,240
of your verbal your sorry your written

277
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,800
communication abilities with your resume

278
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,880
so your telephone interview

279
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,839
your voice and the sound of your voice

280
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,680
the tone your enthusiasm

281
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,640
your passion are really going to tell

282
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,720
them a lot about who you are

283
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,839
and your verbal communication skills

284
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,680
in the time of covid so many of us

285
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,880
are now working remotely especially

286
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,560
those of us who can

287
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,519
and it's really really important that

288
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,200
you show that you're capable of

289
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,320
communicating

290
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,839
remotely so first of all find a quiet

291
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:34,720
place

292
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,920
to have this call make sure you have

293
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,959
full service and then have all of your

294
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,000
questions ready

your resume in front of you the job

spec in front of you with your notes and

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,560
then

298
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,680
smile when you talk it

299
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,800
is so weird i'm on the phone

300
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,680
all day every day while staring at

301
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,560
linkedin

302
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,120
and i can hear it when people are

303
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,079
smiling

304
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,839
while they're talking it's so strange

305
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,360
that you can hear it through the phone

306
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,360
but you can it changes the way that you

307
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,160
speak and it changes the way that people

308
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,000
receive the information that you're

309
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,160
sharing with them so it shows

310
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,600
your enthusiasm your passion and

311
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,399
your interest in the role so please

312
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,760
smile while you talk

313
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,040
speak clearly and slowly but not so

314
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,680
slowly

315
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,360
that they find it tedious to speak with

316
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,920
you just take your time

317
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,079
answer their questions thoroughly i

318
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,640
recommend when they ask a question

319
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,959
allow yourself a moment to absorb

320
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,320
plan your answer and then give your

321
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:42,880
answer

322
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,480
as succinctly as you can

323
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,279
if this is a zoom call please make sure

324
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,519
that your wi-fi is working properly

325

326
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,519

clean up your background aka your house

328
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,760
i had to do that before my video because

329
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,040
i have a puppy that's been playing

330
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,720
behind me all day

331
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,720
and dress professionally it doesn't

332
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,560
matter what you're wearing on the bottom

333
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,440
but wear something nice on the top and

334
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,800
you only get to make one first

335
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,279
impression so don't wear your pjs

336
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,120
and let's see definitely groom your hair

337
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,440
brush your teeth if you had a spinach

338
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,200
salad that day

339
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,680
and dress as well if not better than you

340
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,680
anticipate your interviewer

341
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,440
to dress we're all working from home

342
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,680
these days i know things are casual

343
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,320
things tend to be casual in tech anyway

344
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,920
but

345
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,800
it's not an interview is never the time

346
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,279
to wear

347
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,240
a t-shirt and jeans if you really don't

348
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,680
want to get gussied up

349
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,959
then maybe wear a polo shirt or

350
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,480
um you know a nice collared

351
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,079
button shirt or you know a dress or

352
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,880
a decent sweater anything like that as

353
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,320
long as it's appropriate make sure

354
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,240
it's clean and not wrinkled

355
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,279
and then follow up after this is

356
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,360
something this is the most classic

357
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,959
interview advice that so few people do

358
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,920
anymore and it's absolutely critical so

359
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,720
i wrote up

360
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,360
a little bit of an example there um and

361
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,560
it's

362
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,959
you know it's it it's an imagined

363
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,320
response but

364
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,240
always get your interviewer's email

365
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,720
address and send a memorable thank you

366
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,480
note within 12 hours

367
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,560
so the way that i'm recommending that

368
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,800
you write a memorable thank you note

369
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,880
is really you want to be professional

370
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,480
address the interviewer politely

371
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,680
professionally um

372
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,839
in a friendly way you don't need to be

373
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,360
overly formal

374
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,399
and then be specific tell them why you

375
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,480
enjoyed speaking with them

376
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,199
and tell them what what you loved

377
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,320
learning about

378
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,320
how you see yourself fitting in in this

379
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,839
role be specific

380
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,160
this is why you took notes during the

381
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,000
call so that in the follow-up

382
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,560
you can reference the things that really

383
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,000
stood out to you that you maybe

384
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,279
put two underlines after or under

385
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,240
um so tell them why you think you'd be a

386
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,399
great fit and feel free to mention

387
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,320
how your experience matches up with

388
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,399
something specific that you discussed

389
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,079
maybe it was a project that they told

390
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,320
you is coming up or

391
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,399
anything anything like that a technology

392
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,920
or tool

393
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,079
years of experience anything like that

394
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,199
but

395
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,959
don't worry about selling yourself

396
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,560
you just really need to make sure that

397
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,480
that you really show your enthusiasm for

398
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,560
the role and look forward to speaking

399
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,120
with them

400
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,000
again you don't need to make yourself

401
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,399
sound

402
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,480
overqualified for the role like you've

403
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,519
done

404
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,160
this thing ad nauseum but uh it's

405
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,440
definitely a good idea

406
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,360
to let them know that you that you

407
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,639
