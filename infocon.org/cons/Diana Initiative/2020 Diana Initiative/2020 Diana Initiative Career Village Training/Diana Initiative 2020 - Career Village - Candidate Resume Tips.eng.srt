in the professional world and also at

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,120
other career villages on the regular so

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,480
here we go

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,239
um first and foremost have two resumes

19
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,239
what i really mean by this is have one

20
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,559
resume that's super general

21
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,440
way less detail not specific not

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,199
tailored to a specific job

23
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,039
save that one and use it as your

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,399
template for more specific resumes

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,640
tailored to jobs that you're applying

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,440
for

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,239
based on their job description company

28
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,199
culture

29
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,439
all of that stuff the tech stack all of

30
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,960
it

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,080
great so thinking top to bottom

32
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,560
left to right you've got about five

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,000
seconds to catch

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,159
a hiring manager's attention with your

35
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,759
resume so the way you're gonna do that

36
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:20,680
is by

37
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,920
prioritizing if they scan your resume

38
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,640
looking for the details that make them

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,560
think it's worth it to do another scan

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,240
of your resume

41
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,240
and give you a little bit more time

42
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,840
really what they're looking for

43
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,240
besides your name and contact details

44
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,360
they're going to check to make sure that

45
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,320
that's there

46
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,920
and then they want to see the key

47
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,920
phrases so really your objective

48
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,960
statement is something that they're

49
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,320
probably going to look at in their

50
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,600
second scan

51
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,880
but um text stack and skills towards the

52
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,479
top of the resume

53
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,280
um your experience should be listed in

54
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,680
reverse chronological order

55
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,719
please include the months as long

56
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,840
sorry along with the dates um

57
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,000
the years that you worked somewhere

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,920
don't leave that ambiguous that can come

59
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,320
across

60
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,280
as a red flag your education and

61
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,318
certifications

62
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,640
i recommend go at the bottom of your

63
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,239
resume

64
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,080
there are exceptions to this of course

65
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,680
if you're a recent graduate and you

66
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,800
don't have a lot of professional

67
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,080
experience yet

68
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,120
but you do have a lot of education

69
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,480
then maybe um use the education to

70
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,000
flesh out your resume a bit but

71
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,680
otherwise i'd say education

72
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,400
certifications and then security

73
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,920
community involvement

74
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,879
at the bottom if you regularly attend

75
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:37,280
your

76
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,000
local owasp chapter meetings or your

77
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,160
cloud security alliance meetings

78
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,599
um defcon every year if you've spoken

79
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,959
at a community event in the security

80
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,040
community um if you have published

81
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,800
papers if you have taught at

82
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,360
um like a security bootcamp or

83
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,360
participated in bugbounty

84
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,080
or if you have a really awesome github

85
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,239
all of that information put it on there

86
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,519
and your resume should be more than one

87
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,480
page

88
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,680
unless you don't have very much

89
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,920
experience yet so

90
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,040
i know a lot of resume

91
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,920
advice giving people in the world say

92
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,599
that it should be kept to one page it's

93
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,159
a myth

94
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,680
i place people with two to three page

95
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,720
resumes

96
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,200
all the time especially more senior

97
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,920
people

98
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,599
you don't want to leave out

99
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,840
critical important information that

100
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,000
shows that you're qualified for a job

101
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,200
just for the sake of keeping it to one

102
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,440
page 100 security people are not easy to

103
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,400
find

104
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,599
so please show how awesome you are

105
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,760
by taking up a couple of pages

106
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,159
please please please do not make a 55

107
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,159
page resume

108
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,439
that is a joke from actual experience

109
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,799
so formatting errors you really need to

110
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,080
make sure that

111
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,319
um i really don't recommend cutting and

112
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,680
pasting

113
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,720
to add bullet points to your resume um

114
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,360
from job descriptions so definitely want

115
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,478
to have

116
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,959
three to maybe seven bullet points per

117
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,000
job just kind of

118
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,720
highlighting everything that you've done

119
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,680
but

120
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,400
really you don't want to first of all

121
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,240
have multiple different formats going on

122
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,440
your resume

123
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,479
please choose one typeface

124
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,280
use that throughout so highlight all

125
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,840
make sure that it's all highlighted

126
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,880
all one type face and then if you are

127
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,560
copying and pasting from a job

128
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,400
description i don't recommend doing that

129
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,080
but please change the language

130
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,360
into your own words um

131
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,840
so that it's not obvious but maybe just

132
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,040
write it yourself

133
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,560
um spelling and grammar mistakes

134
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,639
i can't help but see them i'm one of

135
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,479
those people it makes me want to throw a

136
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,600
resume away

137
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,560
i'm sorry um but really there are a lot

138
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,479
of hiring managers who feel this way as

139
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,240
well

140
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,320
this is your one and only chance to make

141
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,919
a first impression with your written

142
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,840
communication skills

143
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,639
show them that your resume is a document

144
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,320
that you take seriously

145
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,479
and that you have enough attention to

146
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,600
detail

147
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,360
to run a spelling and grammar check

148
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,400
really really mean that um no missing

149
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,520
employment dates

150
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,240
you if you took a sabbatical or had a

151
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,280
parental

152
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,680
leave of some kind if you were a

153
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,680
homemaker or

154
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,560
you moved you sailed around the world on

155
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,160
a yacht for a year

156
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,759
include that on your resume keep it

157
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,680
really brief maybe you were doing

158
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,360
something security related in which case

159
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,880
you could elaborate

160
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,400
but leaving a gap can make you

161
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,199
can raise red flags so no employment

162
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:55,680
gaps

163
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,440
no missing dates and no irrelevant

164
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,800
information unless it's

165
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,759
somehow related to the job i'd say leave

166
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,160
off

167
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,919
personal information i know sometimes

168
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,680
people get kind of cute with those

169
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,199
things and

170
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,960
you know it's up to it's up to you as an

171
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,479
individual but i i don't really

172
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,600
recommend it

173
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,080
um you could definitely state that you

174
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,440
have

175
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,720
personal interests but also

176
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,919
older experience beyond 10 years please

177
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,960
just list all of that it's okay to show

178
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,800
that you were an accountant in a past

179
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,199
life

180
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,800
or that you you know maybe

181
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,120
started off as a lawyer and now you're a

182
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,199
security engineer or whatever the thing

183
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,240
might be but

184
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,840
um really no need to be super elaborate

185
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,759
that applies to your education as well

186
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,440
we don't need to see your coursework

187
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,120
again unless you're a recent graduate

188
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:56,960
and once your resume is all judged up

189
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,039
log into your linkedin profile if you

190
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,000
don't have one

191
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,639
create one you are missing out on a

192
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,759
personal marketing tool for your career

193
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,919
update your profile to match your resume

194
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,520
make sure that the dates

195
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,199
are all matching that you didn't just

196
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,400
throw in december every year

197
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,639
job or or whatever it might be and i

198
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,520
recommend

199
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,160
taking the time to put up a recent

200
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,440
professional

201
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,240
photo of you because you're gorgeous and

202
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,000
keep it very simple

203
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,479
just list your dates you don't have to

204
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,319
super duper flesh out your linkedin

205
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,840
profile

206
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,400
i do recommend coming up with a great

207
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,120
headline

208
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,479
to show your skills because um this is a

209
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,240
great way to catch people's eye

210
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,280
and also really kind of utilize that

211
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,560
sort of seo type

212
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,199
searching where um you can catch

213
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,160
recruiters

214
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,199
and hiring managers when they're doing

215
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,039
um targeted boolean searches on linkedin

216
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,120
for candidates who have your skill set

217
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,240
so you can

218
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,240
really add that stuff in your headline

219
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,840
for example if you are

220
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,280
a software security guru

221
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,919
