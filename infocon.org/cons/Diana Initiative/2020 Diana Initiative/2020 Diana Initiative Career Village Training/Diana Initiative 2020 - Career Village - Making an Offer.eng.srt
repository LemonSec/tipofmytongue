00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,759
hi it's chris rides from tyro security

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:06,560
here

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,960
and this is the final video in our

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,719
series that we're putting together in

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,519
conjunction with the diana initiative

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,440
and it's basically focusing on trying to

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,000
iron out the most common issues we see

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,119
within the hiring process and hoping to

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,119
just give a few tips that might actually

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,000
help you

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,119
pull more candidates in and and get a

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,080
larger

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,119
pool of people especially diverse

14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,840
uh people coming through to actually

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,520
right the way through the process so we

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:35,840
can

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,000
actually start affecting these

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,719
underrepresented groups that

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,000
we see within cyber security so the last

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,520
video is about making an offer

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,000
so it's really important you put your

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,039
best foot forward

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,039
and the areas we're going to be covering

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,800
i call it knowledge is power

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,239
and making it special start off with

26
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,160
knowledge is power

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,480
at this point you really should have

28
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,840
gathered gathered enough

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,519
information throughout the whole of the

30
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,200
process to know

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,080
how keen your candidate is and also what

32
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,680
it's going to take to get them to

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,159
accept an offer that you put through to

34
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:14,799
them

35
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,520
and it's really important that through

36
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,680
every single stage of the process

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,840
right away from the beginning that

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,280
you're having a discussion

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,479
with them around their expectations what

40
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,000
they're looking for

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,840
because it does change as it goes right

42
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,200
the way through if you only ever did it

43
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,799
right at the start and then you don't do

44
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,680
it again

45
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,000
things change especially if you're

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,280
you've not been

47
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,880
pushing your process through very

48
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,280
quickly plenty of time

49
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,079
has gone past and all of a sudden their

50
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,759
requirements have changed

51
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,439
that's really common to happen so make

52
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,600
sure that before you even start putting

53
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,360
an offer together

54
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,799
you know exactly what they're looking

55
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,119
for so again ask and then re-ask

56
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,280
no offer unless you know what it's going

57
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,880
to take

58
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,479
so the second part making it special you

59
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,320
you really want when you deliver an

60
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,479
offer you want it to be such an

61
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,199
easy decision for them to say yes right

62
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:09,919
that should be

63
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,959
really simple and you always want to put

64
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:13,680
your best

65
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,480
foot forward so don't nickel and dime

66
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,720
your potential employee

67
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,319
when you do that and we've seen it

68
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,440
happen multiple times when you do that

69
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,959
what are you telling them what does it

70
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,040
say about you as a company what does it

71
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,200
say about how much you value them

72
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,319
what does it say about what it's going

73
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,400
to be like to work there

74
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,560
and you really want to put your best

75
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,760
offer forward

76
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,959
so i would say to say to you you want to

77
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,879
look at beating their expectations you

78
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,160
know what it's going to take for them to

79
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,120
say yes

80
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,120
if you can afford to do it beat those

81
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,640
expectations

82
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,080
right if you can offer a higher salary

83
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,840
than they were expecting great if you

84
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,680
can throw in a sign-on bonus we see a

85
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,959
lot of companies doing that at the

86
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:55,599
moment

87
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,080
or if you can give them some extra stock

88
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,680
it's a great way to make them feel

89
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,640
really wanted

90
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,080
and get them totally 100 committed you

91
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,519
gotta remember

92
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,080
time kills all fields and we we said

93
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,720
this in in video two

94
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,720
you've gotta put a realistic time limit

95
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,239
on to your offers if the candidates

96
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,440
gonna take

97
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,080
your offer a majority of the time

98
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,360
they're going to take it within a couple

99
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,400
of days

100
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,519
if you've managed the process well and

101
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,120
you've been discovering discussing

102
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,360
everything right the way through

103
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,799
they're going to have been discussing

104
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,480
everything right the way through with

105
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,000
the people that matter to them

106
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,920
right so if they have to ask somebody or

107
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,519
talk to somebody about the offer

108
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,360
which of course it's a huge decision

109
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,000
that's understandable

110
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,840
if you've been talking to them about

111
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,400
that they should be already having those

112
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,760
conversations that doesn't mean that

113
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,000
they

114
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,519
won't and you shouldn't give them some

115
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,120
time to think about it

116
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,760
um but what it does say is that in my

117
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,000
experience

118
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,840
if it takes them more than a couple of

119
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,760
days you know if you're giving them the

120
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,040
offer on a thursday and friday and

121
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,080
they're not coming back to you on a

122
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,959
monday

123
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,560
or you're giving it to them on a monday

124
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,920
and you're not hearing anything by

125
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,040
wednesday

126
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,879
chances are your position isn't the one

127
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,239
that they want

128
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,799
now of course yes there are reasons you

129
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,560
know specific reasons why that might not

130
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,120
happen

131
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,959
but i'm talking generically here and a

132
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,040
majority of the time

133
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,040
candidates you we know when we go

134
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,320
through this process

135
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,280
we know when an offers when we know what

136
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,479
the offer is

137
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,320
we know at that point whether somebody's

138
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,680
going to take it or not

139
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,160
and if they're sitting and waiting you

140
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,000
know holding on to that or

141
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,120
you know if you're giving them a crazy

142
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,479
length of time oh think about you can

143
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,680
take a couple of weeks and they're

144
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,520
taking the full two weeks

145
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,199
then the chances are they're either

146
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,800
using it to

147
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
get another offer elsewhere they're

148
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,479
telling them i've got this offer

149
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,040
and they could even be sharing the offer

150
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,560
if you've given it to them in writings

151
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,800
just to be aware that that does happen

152
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,080
they may not supposed to be do it but

153
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,840
that does happen um

154
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,440
they could also just be using it to try

155
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,040
and get a counter off for where they are

156
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,880
at their current employer

157
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,840
and what there may be other you know the

158
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,039
other third thing they could be doing is

159
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:03,680
maybe just

160
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,520
buying themselves time to get through

161
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,520
another interview interview process for

162
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,199
their favorite job

163
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,960
so just be very aware time still

164
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,840
kills all fields show them you value

165
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,240
them

166
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,680
it's really important that you're doing

167
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,800
that if you want to hire a person

168
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,960
this offer stage is absolutely key and

169
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,160
making sure that you've

170
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,520
done the right things throughout the

171
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,919
