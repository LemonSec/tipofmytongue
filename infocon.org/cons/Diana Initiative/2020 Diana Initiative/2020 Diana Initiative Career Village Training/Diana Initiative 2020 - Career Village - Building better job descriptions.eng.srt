00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,120
hi it's chris rides here from tyros

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,319
security

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,720
i'm excited to do our first video in

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,519
partnership

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,920
with the diana initiative and the first

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,559
video

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,679
um entitled where it went wrong

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,359
is regarding the job description

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,480
so it's just a few tips on um what we

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,320
think you need to really be doing so job

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,119
description

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,920
often comes up as an area where when

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,960
we're looking

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,800
and working with certain clients and we

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,120
look at where parts of their process

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,520
aren't really working and why they're

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,200
not really receiving the

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,920
number of candidates uh the quality of

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,960
candidates

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,520
and also you know it's so important that

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,719
the more candidates they bring in the

22
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,320
more likely they'll have a

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,320
more of an ability to to look and

24
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,520
interview people

25
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,360
um that are coming in from various

26
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,280
diverse backgrounds people that

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,039
and groups that are underrepresented in

28
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,719
cyber security

29
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,120
so first things first when we talk about

30
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,160
job descriptions

31
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,039
i'm a believer that two job descriptions

32
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,319
is a good way to go

33
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,520
so two job descriptions a simple one

34
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,439
that just contains the essentials and

35
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,520
the tasks and then expanded one

36
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,159
there's a little bit more detailed uh it

37
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,080
has more essentials and desirable

38
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,040
still has the tasks and also the tools

39
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,439
so

40
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,920
talking a bit more detail um this is one

41
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,560
of my

42
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,080
sayings when you're working out with

43
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,080
your essentials

44
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,600
you don't want to be really adding a

45
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,880
certification within that because

46
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,439
certifications are a quick way to lose

47
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,560
a pool of candidates that have a lot of

48
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,320
great experience and may well be very

49
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,439
good for your role

50
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,880
so what you should be really doing there

51
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,200
is your essentials you want to

52
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,479
really look at when i pick up a resume

53
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,640
and i look at a resume and i'm going

54
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,880
through the things that i really must

55
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,920
see

56
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,520
the things that before i even decide you

57
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,720
know am i going to look through the

58
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,320
whole of this resume it might even be

59
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,600
what are the core

60
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,399
competencies that this person must have

61
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,079
that's what you should be looking for

62
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,320
unless you're getting too many qualified

63
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,439
candidates which

64
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,318
in our industry isn't really happening

65
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,758
you want to make this as broad as

66
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:10,639
possible

67
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,560
um and so you want to keep your

68
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,040
essentials to the absolute essentials

69
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,360
so again good way to do it look at the

70
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,120
resume what's the first things you look

71
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,720
for on that resume

72
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,319
write them down write them down in the

73
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,800
order that you look or notice them

74
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,480
right and then sanity check that with

75
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,239
yourself whether that's a

76
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,640
personal preference or is that and

77
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,040
really an essential need for the job

78
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,200
i always say try to keep these things to

79
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,200
sort of five or less

80
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,599
use very broad descriptions rather than

81
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,800
specific skills

82
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,800
just be aware what you're trying to do

83
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,560
is in with this job description

84
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,680
and and if you are going to be doing

85
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,959
some advertising and things like that

86
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,080
this is what you're probably going to

87
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,879
use

88
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,040
you want this job description to attract

89
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,040
as many people as possible

90
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,400
right it needs to bring in now the right

91
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,319
type of people certainly which is why

92
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,159
it's important it's accurate but you

93
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,599
want to bring in as many people as

94
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,560
possible

95
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,879
so you've got options right so be wary

96
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,239
when you're looking at essentials when

97
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,840
you're when you're doing this

98
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,920
i'd be very wary of putting tools

99
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,680
specific tools in this job spec

100
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,239
unless when i say job spec is another

101
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,440
word for job description

102
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,680
unless it's an absolute non-negotiable

103
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,720
that somebody has that

104
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,280
if they can't do this job and they won't

105
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,040
be successful in the short term

106
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,360
without having that specific skill then

107
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,400
add it

108
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,480
however if it's something somebody can

109
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,599
learn

110
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,280
and somebody somebody can pick up very

111
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,840
quickly then you don't need to have that

112
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,840
specific skill you might have to have

113
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,640
knowledge of tools that do certain

114
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,680
things

115
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,080
but not specifically maybe that's all so

116
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,760
just think about that and then tasks are

117
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,640
very simple

118
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,840
you want to make sure that people

119
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,519
understand what the tasks of the job are

120
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,000
and that they're

121
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,159
on the same page it's no good having a

122
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,360
load of people

123
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,959
replying to your job only to find that

124
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,360
they don't want to do the actual what

125
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,640
the actual job is so

126
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,280
so just bear that in mind so um

127
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,200
your second one is the expanded job

128
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,879
description

129
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,720
and when i look at this sort of stuff

130
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,640
i'm thinking here you want to keep

131
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,799
the essentials from your first one so

132
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,640
your simple job description should cover

133
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,599
all of that

134
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,360
it should cover your shirts short-term

135
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,079
needs because your medium and long-term

136
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,759
what you're hopefully able to do

137
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,079
is work with that that candidate and

138
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,600
work with a successful kind of build

139
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,639
their knowledge up

140
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,400
you know that's something that actually

141
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,000
helps retain staff if you're

142
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,240
investing into them and and the medium

143
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,440
to long-term skills

144
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,600
they should be the investment it's the

145
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,960
short-term ones that should be

146
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,639
the essentials now when we come down to

147
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,160
desirables

148
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,160
these are nice to haves these are the

149
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,160
skills and experience that would benefit

150
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,960
your team

151
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,280
maybe in the medium to long term or

152
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,560
they're the things that would benefit in

153
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,520
the short term

154
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,800
but aren't essential and and

155
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,720
like doing this it's a great way to find

156
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,520
out if your your long term goals

157
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,680
meet the areas that that candidate's

158
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,360
long-term goals are right if you're

159
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,000
looking

160
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,199
to for that to be a fit and then tasks

161
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,120
again really easy you take those tasks

162
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,800
from your your simple job spec

163
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,639
the the job description the first one

164
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,240
that you're doing

165
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,520
and then last one tools used so

166
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,880
i was wary about putting this um this is

167
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,520
more about

168
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,600
information i did put i think on the

169
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,039
first slide that we talked about

170
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,360
internal and external and a simple job

171
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,000
spec is a great one to use externally

172
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,039
the more complex and and

173
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,120
sort of more detailed job spec that's

174
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,440
the one that you probably want to use

175
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,240
internally or once somebody's already in

176
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,840
the

177
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,759
process you know and and

178
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,880
the reason why tools should go on this

179
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,600
one

180
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,000
if you're going to do it is because that

181
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,280
gives you an idea of what what

182
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,120
specifically they've been using what

183
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,000
you're using

184
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,400
gives them an idea of your environment

185
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,440
the one thing you have to be very

186
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,400
careful of

187
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,360
is when you give lists of tools people

188
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,560
without

189
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,560
uh without necessarily the technical

190
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,479
knowledge so it might be

191
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,520
recruiters internal hr and they could

192
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,199
use those tools just as keywords and

193
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,720
that's not going to be very useful if

194
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,319
those tools aren't essential

195
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,880
so just be very very careful about that

196
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,600
and

197
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,360
i know this sounds really strange i

198
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,280
recommend lots of kissing through the

199
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,400

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,520
