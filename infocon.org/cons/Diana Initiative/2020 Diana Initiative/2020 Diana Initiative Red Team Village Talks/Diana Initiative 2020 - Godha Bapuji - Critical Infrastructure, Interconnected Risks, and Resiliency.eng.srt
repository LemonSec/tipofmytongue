00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,960
hello everyone

2
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,039
this is goda bapuji thank you red team

3
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,640
village and the dinah initiative for

4
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,000
inviting me here

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,680
today i'm going to talk about critical

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,760
infrastructure interconnected risks and

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,280
why we should care

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,200
as a woman in tech this is particularly

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,040
an important matter for me

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,800
and i'm going to share why this is so

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,640
so this is what we're going to do i'll

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,680
tell you a little bit about what

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,800
critical infrastructure

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,920
is what we mean by industry 4.0

15
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,000
and we'll also try and understand some

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,600
general terms that we use in cyber

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,239
security

18
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,559
and understand the interrelated risks

19
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,239
and then we go on to look at

20
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,760
some of the more threats and

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,519
vulnerabilities but

22
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,280
on top of that we're also going to

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,799
understand what cognitive and

24
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,960
sociocultural limitations are

25
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,000
and how and why we need to understand

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,159
this in order to build resilience

27
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,600
through preparedness and capacity

28
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,000
planning we'll look at some of the gaps

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,240
and some of the barriers especially from

30
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,159
a gender perspective and this is

31
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,200
why women should

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,640
specifically be looking at this

33
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,240
presentation

34
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,439
thank you and let's begin so what is

35
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,159
critic

36
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,479
critical infrastructure critical

37
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,360
infrastructure

38
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,360
are those essential public services such

39
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,200
as hospitals banking

40
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,119
schools water treatment plans etc

41
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,000
and traditionally what has happened is

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,560
these

43
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,159
systems have existed for many years

44
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,280
but in the modern context these systems

45
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,399
are now connected

46
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,040
increasingly via the internet and we are

47
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,439
automating them so that we can remotely

48
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,960
administer them

49
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,640
this is in short what we call the

50
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,520
industry 4.0

51
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,919
and here's a really good definition that

52
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,360
i really like from the

53
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,720
center for protection of national

54
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,959
infrastructure united kingdom

55
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,319
national infrastructure are those

56
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,480
facilities systems sites information

57
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,239
people networks and processes

58
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,720
necessary for a country to function and

59
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,160
upon which daily life

60
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,800
depends so pay attention to the keyword

61
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,760
daily life

62
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,160
dependency it also includes some

63
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,800
functions

64
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,480
sites and organizations which are not

65
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,160
critical to the maintenance of essential

66
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,959
services

67
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,440
but which need protection due to the

68
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,280
potential danger to public

69
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,959
example chemical sites

70
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,760
so here's a really good graphic and if

71
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,640
you guys see

72
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,840
um all of the links that i've used for

73
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,200
different graphics and different

74
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,920
references

75
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,400
for this presentation i have listed them

76
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,120
at the bottom

77
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,319
of the slide so you will be able to

78
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,159
go to this website and look at it in

79
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,080
much more detail

80
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,360
so if you look at the history of our

81
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,879
industries on sort of a timeline

82
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,640
there was an original um inventions of

83
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,120
steam engines mechanization and water

84
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,080
power

85
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,239
and then when electricity was invented

86
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,319
we went on to we discovered

87
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,319
electric based industries and we went on

88
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,560
to mass production

89
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,480
in the um after the war we discovered a

90
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,159
lot of technology

91
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,239
that revolved around internet the

92
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,640
internet was created which actually

93
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,959
created a whole different world in which

94
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:37,760
we could work

95
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,599
in and then when electronics took hold

96
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,159
we had the whole automation take on a

97
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,319
completely different meaning

98
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,840
now we come to what we call as the

99
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,680
fourth industrial revolution

100
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,920
what does that mean it's basically just

101
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,959
an extension

102
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,000
of everything we have until today

103
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,959
including the internet but there's more

104
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,120
automation and there's more remote

105
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,480
administration

106
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,879
and we also sometimes call it the cyber

107
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,879
physical systems because now the

108
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,720
traditional physical systems that have

109
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,480
existed across the three

110
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,360
uh past industrial revolutions are now

111
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,000
more being brought onto the internet

112
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,519
so this graphic is a really good one

113
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,759
um what is an industrial control system

114
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,880
so i

115
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,720
i'm giving you a very simplistic

116
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,479
definition here industrial control

117
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,479
systems are a set of components devices

118
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,240
and systems that together

119
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,400
control administer and manage the

120
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,479
critical infrastructure

121
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,759
and you will hear of this terminology

122
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,479
the ics folks may talk about this so you

123
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,160
hear of things like process control

124
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,320
system distributed control system

125
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,960
plc's programming uh programmable logic

126
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,040
controllers scada systems

127
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,520
um just remember that these are all

128
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,080
different

129
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,840
systems that are now additionally

130
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,600
accessible remotely via the internet

131
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,880
on the cyber realm

132
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,560
i've been asked this question a few

133
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,280
times

134
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,199
so i see a security is it not the same

135
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,720
as i.t security

136
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,280
and of course i've also heard a bit of

137
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,479
confusion between

138
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,600
it security and information security

139
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,639
but here's the thing ics security varies

140
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,039
from

141
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,759
i.t security because the attack vectors

142
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,880
and the impact surface

143
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,840
bleed into civilian lives if you

144
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,880
remember the first

145
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,360
slide our lives depend on the services

146
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,520
that we receive from hospitals banking

147
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,320
schools

148
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,000
and different infrastructure so we

149
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,919
depend on these services on a day-to-day

150
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,440
basis

151
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,919
which means if something happens to any

152
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,440
of these services

153
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,160
our lives directly get impacted so as

154
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,000
you can see this is completely

155
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,960
different from how a a cyber attack may

156
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,840
impact an i.t

157
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,160
infrastructure and ics basically works

158
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,840
in two main types of scenarios

159
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,759
now this is um it goes to bit of

160
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,919
engineering uh terminology and

161
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,360
those of you folks who come from an

162
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,440
engineering background might easily

163
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,960
understand this

164
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,759
the two main scenarios are process-based

165
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,400
industries and discrete-based industries

166
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,720
now what's happening is electrical and

167
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,280
mechanical have converged

168
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,080
on the cyber realm which means

169
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,280
previously

170
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,759
um whatever was protected through

171
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,319
obscurity is now exposed because of the

172
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,919
internet and because

173
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,000
um the internet allows remote

174
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,400
administration we are able to

175
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,680
con control different aspects

176
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,520
at the physical state remotely

177
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,160
so just imagine a pivoted attack in a

178
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,479
process-based industry

179
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,840
the entire downward cycle gets impacted

180
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,919
whereas in a typical industry

181
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,080
process-based industry or discrete-based

182
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,120
industry

183
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,520
safety is a top priority then comes

184
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,919
reliability of the process

185
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,400
and then the information security cia

186
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,319
triad which is the confidentiality

187
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,880
integrity availability triad comes next

188
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,039
but we have to remember the golden rule

189
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,800
must not harm people

190
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,160
and that is key here for ics security

191
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,639
they care more about safety

192
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,400
so here's a little graphic that i

193
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,319
thought was really good and

194
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,080
summarized the difference between

195
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,560
process versus discrete based industry

196
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,759
so you can see here process

197
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,759
manufacturing industries food beverages

198
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,800
pharmaceuticals cosmetics chemicals

199
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,479
these are all examples of process-based

200
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,759
manufacturing whereas discrete

201
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,680
manufacturing as you can see here

202
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,919
they are parts based manufacturing so

203
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,280
examples are

204
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,479
in medical devices electrical electrical

205
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,120
equipment

206
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,759
automobile manufacturing and things like

207
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,000
that

208
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,440
so if you now look at the whole picture

209
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,680
at a very high level you understand that

210
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,479
what we call

211
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,039
cyber security cyber in the sense

212
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,160
network security

213
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,160
everything that we do on the internet

214
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,960
impacts every aspect of our life

215
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,199
so i put together a little graphic to

216
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,000
show us this

217
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,639
interconnection cyber security provides

218
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,199
overall

219
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,080
human security it ensures service

220
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,360
availability

221
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,800
it assures integrity and it impacts

222
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,120
all of these services now these are not

223
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,520
exhaustively listed on this graphic but

224
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,280
you get the idea based on the previous

225
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,360
discussion that we had

226
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,639
so why should we as civilians care well

227
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,120
i already told you that internet of

228
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,839
things

229
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,519
blurs a line between electrical and

230
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,200
mechanical

231
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,559
and what we thought was previously

232
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,839
secure because it was just a physical

233
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,920
safety aspect and not on the internet

234
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,920
you could simply lock the door

235
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,600
put a padlock on it and think it's

236
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,519
secure but now

237
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,200
that is exposed on the internet

238
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,000
so the security through obscurity no

239
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,080
longer seems valid

240
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,160
which also means that engineering

241
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,760
operational architecture and design

242
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,600
professionals can no more

243
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,600
say oh security does not impact us

244
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,519
cyber attacks don't impact us we cannot

245
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,200
say that anymore

246
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,959
which means also that when operational

247
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:17,680
folks

248
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,560
when engineers design infrastructures

249
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,720
for cities and industrial systems

250
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,279
we not only have to think about safety

251
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,279
but we have to think about security

252
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,320
and privacy as well

253
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,880
because our lives depend on these daily

254
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,200
services

255
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,920
so what what are the risks of connecting

256
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,160
these devices to the internet

257
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,839
and there's that term that we used

258
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,519
internet of things

259
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,000
so you might be very familiar looking at

260
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,640
these

261
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,920
acronyms iot and iiot internet of things

262
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,399
and

263
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,959
industrial internet of things now here

264
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,240
is a little question for you to think

265
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,120
about

266
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,959
do we really need our profe personal

267
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,480
coffee maker our toaster our

268
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,000
refrigerator our smart tv on the

269
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,800
internet

270
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,519
think about it is it necessary i don't

271
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,079
think it is

272
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,920
so we need to understand the risks

273
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,160
before we do something before we put our

274
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,560
enable the smartness on our tv we need

275
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,160
to think is it really necessary

276
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,519
do you really need to check your egg

277
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,079
levels from your iphone

278
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,760
in the refrigerator so let's

279
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,279
look at the risks threats

280
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,079
vulnerabilities and some of those things

281
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,279
now here's a really good picture that i

282
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,720
like sharing and this is from the world

283
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,200
economic firm's global risk report

284
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,640
you can see the link at the bottom this

285
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,279
is from the 2020 report

286
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,880
this is a great visual to help you see

287
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,000
what i mean by interconnected risks

288
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,079
typically when you think of risk you

289
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,839
know we might think okay

290
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,040
if i do this something happens

291
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,959
but then in an interconnected risk you

292
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,959
have to think if i do this

293
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,040
what are the different things that might

294
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,480
happen or

295
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,480
if something happens somewhere how is it

296
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,160
going to impact me

297
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,200
and that is the meaning of

298
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,360
interconnected risks so as you can see

299
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,079
this is not

300
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,200
linear it is almost like a node in a

301
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,320
graph

302
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,040
so there are multi-point variables from

303
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,600
where

304
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
you could be impacted because something

305
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,120
is happening which is causing something

306
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,519
else

307
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,760
somewhere and you could be impacted

308
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,959
because of that

309
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,640
that's how we need to think in our

310
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,720
modern context and that's why i really

311
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,839
like this picture

312
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,800
there's another important thing defense

313
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,120
and military organizations like nato

314
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,440
have formally recognized cyberspace as a

315
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,279
new frontier in defence

316
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,959
along with land arc which means

317
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,600
the cyber realm could be used to wage

318
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,240
cyber warfare

319
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,560
on the computer networks what does it

320
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,440
mean

321
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,120
it means that the alliance could use

322
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,800
cyber weapons to manage global threats

323
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,079
to systems and infrastructure

324
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,639
used by nato allies remember this

325
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,079
keyword

326
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,920
allies north america and european

327
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,120
countries

328
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,200
what about other countries are they

329
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,200
prepared

330
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,360
in short is the civilian world ready for

331
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,440
the impact from new generation warfare

332
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,040
that's the key question we need to ask

333
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,360
ourselves

334
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,639
let's look at this now it's an

335
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,240
interesting map and it's from

336
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,880
imperva.com

337
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,040
and just not to

338
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,440
sort of take it out of context but

339
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,200
actually to bring it into context if you

340
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,639
look at this map today you might think

341
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,480
maybe these are coveted infections covet

342
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,839
19 infections

343
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,480
but actually not this is from 2016 when

344
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,000
the mirai botnet

345
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,360
infected computers all over the world

346
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,519
and surprisingly it was a very simple

347
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,440
attack a distributed denial of service

348
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,079
attack

349
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,600
and it targeted cctv's cameras

350
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,440
dvrs routers so you see what i mean

351
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,000
of how pervasive internet attacks can

352
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,480
get

353
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,519
and control our lives

354
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,760
the international federation of red

355
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,160
cross actually helps us

356
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,000
divide disasters into um five

357
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,760
big types so you've got the geophysical

358
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,000
disasters you've got biological you've

359
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,079
got climate disaster

360
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,160
and you've got weather related disasters

361
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,639
and you've got hydrological disasters

362
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,120
but think about this on top of the

363
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,399
existing

364
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,720
disasters that we already know that are

365
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,680
quite complex

366
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,200
as it is earthquakes fires

367
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,320
tsunamis on top of these things think

368
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,480
about the social inequities that exist

369
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,800
in our societies

370
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,560
and then think about the irreversible

371
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,120
damage we are doing to our ecosystems

372
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,639
to our biodiversity and think about the

373
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:47,519
unsustained

374
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,920
unhindered development policies that put

375
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,839
profits over people

376
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,120
these are all the counteracting forces

377
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,440
on top of that think about inequitable

378
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,560
technological

379
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,000
developments which means if you don't

380
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,240
really pay attention to the stuff that

381
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,160
we're putting online

382
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,160
to the type of code we are writing to

383
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,680
the security and safety of our systems

384
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,079
when something happens now think about

385
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,639
the interrelated risks picture that i

386
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,519
showed you the innermost circle that you

387
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:19,920
see

388
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,120
a geophysical disaster like an

389
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,639
earthquake

390
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,000
might impact infinite systems

391
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,079
which means people who are already in

392
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,720
poverty may not be able to access

393
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,680
services that are provided online kovid

394
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,320
19

395
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,399
has actually shown us how life can be

396
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,360
during a global pandemic something that

397
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,360
affects everybody across the world

398
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,240
the entire world was shut down but we

399
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,199
all got along

400
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,079
we all kept together one reason we had

401
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,760
the internet with us

402
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,440
but just imagine if the internet were to

403
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,120
be impacted

404
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,519
the internet cannot become our single

405
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,399
point of failure

406
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,240
and this is why it's important for us to

407
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,440
pay attention to this fact

408
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,040
so what are the types of vulnerabilities

409
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,839
that the internet faces and why is this

410
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,800
important

411
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,120
more than you can believe the internet

412
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,800
actually allows us

413
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,000
to conduct several types of attacks

414
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,480
sometimes human become the weakest links

415
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,720
because what happens usually is we pay a

416
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,320
lot of attention

417
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,920
to um you know installing

418
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,839
um ssl certificates to doing a giving a

419
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,880
great ux ui on our systems but some of

420
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,199
the

421
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,399
core services that start at the physical

422
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,120
level

423
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,279
or some of the core services that are at

424
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,120
the database level

425
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,279
we typically tend to ignore them or

426
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,880
forget them

427
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,199
or think that oh this is on the

428
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,160
innermost network

429
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,880
nobody is able to access it that's the

430
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,839
typical excuse that we hear

431
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,639
but then just imagine with more and more

432
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,639
interconnected systems

433
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,279
it is harder for us to find out where

434
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,480
the attack is coming from

435
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,320
which means we are not sure of the

436
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,320
vectors of the attack

437
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,199
it could be from anywhere and this

438
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,720
graphic is really neat because this

439
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,519
gives us sort of

440
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,279
a high level overview of the different

441
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,240
types of attacks that could happen in an

442
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,120
industrial system

443
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,639
on top of that as you may already know

444
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,959
mobile phones have their own problems

445
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,800
they are not completely secure

446
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,240
well you might say yeah i'm going to

447
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,000
turn off my locations

448
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,720
setting in in the settings but turning

449
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,399
off location settings does not

450
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,199
completely resolve the issue the device

451
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,000
itself

452
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,399
has location tracking abilities and

453
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,519
there are

454
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,759
several issues within the device

455
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,279
software itself

456
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,519
so mobile phones have their own set of

457
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,320
problems that complicate issues further

458
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,559
so just think if you're using the mobile

459
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,039
phone to remotely administer

460
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,119
your systems your critical systems

461
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,319
that's not a very good idea

462
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,359
over that you've got networking

463
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,640
protocols that have their own

464
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,559
limitations a lot of these protocols

465
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,520
have been

466
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,119
are legacy protocols they have been

467
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,559
written many years ago

468
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,919
are they forward compatible we

469
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,160
try to patch them every now and then

470
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,320
right we try to do our maintenance on

471
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,200
our systems

472
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,000
yes but inherently a lot of these

473
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,880
protocols

474
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,240
have limitations within themselves and

475
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,960
you may have heard a lot about the

476
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,400
issues around the 5g

477
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,440
network but do your research don't

478
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,039
believe what the media tells you don't

479
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:49,919
believe what you

480
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,400
see on the internet i suggest you do

481
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,840
your own research

482
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,240
read scientific journals read

483
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,000
engineering journals

484
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,520
make sure they come from reputable

485
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,720
sources look at the number of citations

486
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,360
for each of these articles and then you

487
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,559
understand

488
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,799
the type of issues that your networking

489
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:09,760
protocols

490
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,360
have software maintenance brings

491
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,559
additional complexity

492
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,720
in highly interconnected systems

493
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,000
especially now if you

494
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,640
couple them with your critical systems

495
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,520
and that's why

496
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,840
it's important for us to critically

497
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,039
think

498
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,679
if and how we should connect our

499
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,600
industrial systems to the network

500
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,440
and not just our industrial systems but

501
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,520
also our daily

502
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,120
life stuff that we say

503
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,440
as in internet of things within our

504
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,240
homes

505
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,640
onto the network because here's a

506
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,160
thought

507
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,320
although we might say oh i don't have

508
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,400
any important data on me

509
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,960
there's nothing expensive that i hold or

510
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,679
there's nothing confidential that i hold

511
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,840
but what usually happens is if you don't

512
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,440
pay attention to the security of your

513
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,000
devices

514
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
at your home or in your small business

515
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,200
your system could be used

516
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,720
as one of the routes through which

517
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,280
other attacks could be launched so you

518
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,799
have to really pay attention to even

519
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,679
your security

520
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,840
and here's the fact as humans we have

521
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,919
cognitive limitations

522
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,600
which means you also have to remember

523
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,600
that artificial intelligence code can

524
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,840
also have this bias and limitation built

525
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,640
in as a result because the way we think

526
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,200
the way

527
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,760
we make decisions those decisions will

528
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,640
be reflected

529
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,559
in the way we program and write these

530
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,400
aii code and the way we

531
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,000
train ml to recognize

532
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,360
the the learning patterns so it's very

533
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,080
important to

534
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,320
recognize that we have cognitive

535
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,559
limitations that will impact

536
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,320
security and safety and here's a

537
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,160
nice uh matrix on a grid this comes from

538
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,240
a the very famous book thinking fast and

539
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,559
slow by kahneman and swirsky

540
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,480
and it's called a four-fold pattern of

541
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,080
preferences what it basically

542
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,679
tells you is that as humans

543
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,960
we have fallacies which means depending

544
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,400
on whether we are winning

545
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,200
or losing

546
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,600
how much risk we are willing to take

547
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,640
changes

548
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,880
and this matrix is a very good way to

549
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,440
look at it

550
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,280
and we also work under many limitations

551
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,440
for example you've got

552
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,799
laws that give you the overarching rules

553
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,240
of how you have to

554
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,200
work within your environment you've got

555
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,159
regulations

556
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,760
and then you've got contractual

557
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,200
obligations

558
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,559
but on top of that you've got

559
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,120
geopolitics and you've got your social

560
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,000
cultural norms

561
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,520
that tell you whether or not you should

562
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,360
be doing something how much integrity do

563
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,240
you have whether

564
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,240
the commit you know whether you carry

565
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,760
out your business operations with

566
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,640
integrity

567
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,760
there are so many aspects that impact

568
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,320
how we think about security and safety

569
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,600
and how we make

570
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,159
decisions about risk so when you want to

571
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,840
know how you make decisions about risk

572
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,640
think about the

573
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,039
matrix that i showed you we tend to make

574
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,720
decisions based on

575
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,440
whether we are winning or losing and our

576
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,720
risk attitude changes

577
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,520
according to that

578
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,760
so what's the best way to get out of all

579
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,880
of this the best way

580
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,640
is to be prepared we need to prepare

581
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,320
really well we need to understand what

582
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,440
we are preparing for

583
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,880
and that's why capacity planning

584
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,679
one of the um biggest deficiencies that

585
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,320
i note i've noticed over the past

586
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,080
you know over two decades that have been

587
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,880
in the industry is that

588
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,640
most of the companies most of the

589
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,000
organizations many

590
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,360
of us don't really have a tab

591
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,559
on what our assets are what are critical

592
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,600
assets are be it

593
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,320
information be devices so asset

594
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,320
management is really poor

595
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,200
even today and what do we mean by asset

596
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,559
management

597
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,559
if you really don't know what your

598
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,240
empire looks like

599
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,480
or what your organization looks like

600
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,799
what are the key

601
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,039
assets that you need to protect what is

602
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,880
important to you

603
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,720
if we don't have that classification

604
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,960
categorization and prioritization

605
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,120
it is very hard to protect because you

606
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,159
cannot literally

607
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,720
protect put a bubble around everything

608
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,799
so that's why asset recognition is very

609
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,880
important we need to characterize it

610
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,600
based on priority that way it becomes

611
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,880
easier for us to

612
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,480
segregate our assets give them priority

613
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,200
in terms of security and confidentiality

614
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,640
and whether or not they have to be

615
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,960
available 24 7

616
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,280
and depending on these decisions we can

617
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,159
then provide

618
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,880
the relevant safety and security for

619
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,600
these assets

620
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,880
now that you have a very high level a

621
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,000
very quick overview

622
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,320
of what critical infrastructure is what

623
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,760
do we mean by ics

624
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,679
and how does cyber security relate to

625
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,200
all of these things you might be

626
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,720
wondering so what can i do to help

627
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,280
protect our ics

628
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,440
of course as i say here you must join in

629
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,200
the workforce for the future

630
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,360
skills required to defend rics now here

631
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,039
are some of the skills that i

632
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,840
recommend learning um the first i would

633
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,200
start with understanding network

634
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,799
protocols and how they might differ in

635
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,240
industrial systems

636
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,480
so take time to actually study network

637
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,360
protocols

638
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,520
take time to study operating systems how

639
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,200
the kernel and the core of the operating

640
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,159
systems work

641
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,760
because most of the security

642
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,720
vulnerabilities exist within this core

643
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,559
so it's very important for us to

644
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,880
understand how legacy systems work how

645
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,000
new systems work

646
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,360
and what are the um middle

647
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,279
layer applications that connect these

648
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,640
two

649
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,240
we really need to understand that so you

650
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,840
could start with that

651
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,600
on top of that you could understand what

652
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,279
policy and safety regulations

653
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,440
mean in industrial zones they look very

654
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,440
different compared to the safety

655
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,360
the security policies that you might see

656
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,360
in an i.t sector

657
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,799
so it's very important for us to

658
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,640
understand

659
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,400
what these safety regulations are

660
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,159
and you also have to remember that every

661
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,440
country has a

662
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,000
different set almost similar but they

663
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,440
there could be some differences

664
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,679
in the way a country recognizes their

665
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,120
critical infrastructure

666
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,200
for in some countries for example there

667
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,240
are about

668
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,279
in in the u.s we have about 16 sectors

669
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,200
that we classify under critical

670
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,840
infrastructure

671
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,200
in uk i think we have 13.

672
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,320
so you have to understand the definition

673
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,400
of critical infrastructure wiles remains

674
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,679
the same

675
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,679
what is designated as a critical

676
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,440
infrastructure may vary between

677
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,559
countries

678
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,720
so it would be a nice step forward to

679
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,840
understand

680
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,559
apart from the policies and regulations

681
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,000
in industrial zones

682
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,840
what are critical sectors in each of

683
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,600
these countries that you're working with

684
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,200
so it would be nice to understand learn

685
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,240
that

686
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,880
and some of the basic things it's good

687
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,880
to understand how electrical electronic

688
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,640
and mechanical devices work together in

689
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,480
industrial systems

690
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,120
so it might be really nice perhaps if

691
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,880
you're considering taking a degree now

692
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,400
you're at that stage then maybe you

693
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,000
should consider an engineering degree

694
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,080
you could study engineering so you know

695
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,679
the question how does engineering relate

696
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,039
to cyber security will i become a hacker

697
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,559
yes that's not the question to think

698
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,880
about now that is a very single focused

699
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,760
question

700
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,600
you have to think about interconnected

701
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,000
risks you have to think about all these

702
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,679
things that i have shared in the past

703
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:30,400
few minutes

704
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,720
to say why should i be looking at these

705
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,720
things and how does it relate with cyber

706
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,279
security

707
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,360
the next one understanding risks

708
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,960
vulnerabilities threats and

709
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,880
impact on communities due to an

710
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,720
industrial system failure

711
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,320
now i've told you about the different

712
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,279
aspects of why industrial security and

713
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,039
critical systems are important to us as

714
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,799
civilians

715
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,720
which means we have to understand the

716
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,720
interconnected risks that these systems

717
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,360
bring if they are on the internet and

718
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,159
available via remote administration

719
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,880
if something fails in the systems how

720
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,279
does it impact our daily life

721
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,080
so one example is a water treatment plan

722
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,000
what happens if a water treatment plant

723
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,440
the actuator goes shuts off

724
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,240
maybe the sewage system doesn't work our

725
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,320
water systems get polluted

726
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,679
just imagine what might come out of your

727
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,480
tap is it safe enough to drink

728
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,840
so you have to think about

729
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,400
interconnections at that level

730
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,640
start from the industry think about your

731
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,559
own life and think about how these two

732
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,840
things are connected now

733
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,960
we cannot only think about information

734
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,320
in the modern context we have to think

735
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,279
about physical safety and security

736
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,279
therefore we have to understand what are

737
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,640
the defenses

738
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,799
what do we mean by business continuity

739
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,159
and what do we actually mean by

740
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,799
resilience

741
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,039
for each of these systems which means

742
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,960
when something happens

743
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,679
do we have a backup plan if the internet

744
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,440
were to go down in a certain part of the

745
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,240
region

746
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,200
do we have backup of working without the

747
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,640
internet

748
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,240
it almost seems um pervasive how we tend

749
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,799
to google everything

750
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,919
can you do that can you think of options

751
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,320
and solutions without googling do you

752
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,320
have access to telephone directories and

753
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,320
information at your fingertips written

754
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,360
down somewhere

755
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,679
do you have a physical backup of things

756
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,039
these are the type of things that you

757
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,559
have to think about in order to become

758
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,440
resilient

759
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,360
in the modern context and that's why

760
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,520
this matters

761
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,520
beyond all these things you also have to

762
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,520
understand the cultures and geopolitics

763
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,039
of the world what's going on

764
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,840
in the world is very important because

765
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,760
what happens elsewhere

766
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,600
will now impact our lives directly

767
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,720
be it a health pandemic or be it a cyber

768
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,240
security issue

769
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,000
we really have to pay attention to what

770
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,520
is going on in the world

771
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,120
which means we have to understand the

772
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,279
politics that's going on in the world

773
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,880
and how those politics can play into

774
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,679
the services that we have and perhaps

775
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:08,159
how

776
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,080
the services could be used as a tool

777
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,840
to conduct cyber warfare

778
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,039
now this is not an endorsement of aws

779
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,159
but i just thought

780
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,600
um because i really like um these are

781
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,080
these services and um they're one of my

782
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,640
favorites

783
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,559
i thought i should share this with you

784
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,200
so pick up your favorite cloud service

785
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,760
any from any vendor and look at what

786
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,440
type of cloud services they offer

787
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,520
what type of specifically with respect

788
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,880
to iot

789
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,640
and ics look at what

790
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,279
software they offer look at what kind of

791
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,919
equipment and devices they offer

792
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,399
and maybe go ahead and learn the skills

793
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,840
because these are the type of skills

794
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,879
we'll need for future

795
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,840
and you could learn about threat

796
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,679
modeling that's a nice

797
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,399
start as well to understand what exactly

798
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,360
happens

799
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,600
in the mind of an attacker and how do

800
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,919
you go about resolving that or counter

801
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,279
attacking that or defending that so

802
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,440
this slide gives you some sort of a

803
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,159
start to that with a few links here

804
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,480
some of my favorite links but also if

805
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,679
you look at this

806
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,000
little graphic on the right hand side

807
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,840
you see that the adversary group

808
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,000
uses techniques and this is by mitre

809
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,480
the techniques accomplish certain

810
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,720
tactics

811
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,200
and the adversity group also uses

812
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,559
software

813
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,200
and social engineering to achieve what

814
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,200
they want to achieve

815
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,799
in terms of a cyber attack so this is

816
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,799
a really nice graphic and i highly

817
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,159
recommend

818
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,760
going through the mitre attack and the

819
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,360
cyber kill chain

820
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,799
to understand how exactly an attacker

821
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:57,360
thinks

822
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,360
so that you can defend in the same way

823
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,840
by following the tracks now i mentioned

824
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,520
about geopolitics so this is another

825
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,720
area where i would highly recommend

826
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,679
you looking into is international

827
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,640
relations and international security

828
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,559
take these courses take get a degree

829
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,159
maybe and study how

830
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,120
nations perceive cyber security it's a

831
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,399
very different lens

832
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,080
you'll get by studying international

833
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,760
relations and world politics and

834
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,720
security

835
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,840
at the global level to understand how

836
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,520
countries think about

837
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,840
cyber security what kind of systems do

838
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,279
they have in place

839
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,679
so you're taking a very high level view

840
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:38,960
at security

841
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,799
and it helps you understand the

842
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,799
interconnections when you zoom out and

843
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:43,760
look at things from

844
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,720
a higher level and then you also

845
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,320
understand what type of international

846
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,760
laws apply to the field of

847
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,399
cyber security so here i recommend a

848
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:53,919
good place to start would be the nato

849
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:54,640
website

850
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,679
they have wonderful resources for you to

851
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:58,640
go look at

852
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,399
and and study if you like the talent 2.0

853
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,240
manual is also a great start is one of

854
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,840
my favorite places to

855
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,480
understand um cyber laws it is available

856
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,080
online so you could look at

857
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,159
the online resource and look at all the

858
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,760
different laws that they have created it

859
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,960
is not a

860
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,080
um a binding law but it is sort of

861
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,039
put together as a guidance for the cyber

862
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,519
security community

863
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,679
and here's a learning map that i offer

864
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:26,720
so you could

865
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,399
say you know understand the key terms

866
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,000
and this is basically the learning map

867
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,039
that i have

868
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,919
designed the slide deck as well so make

869
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:34,799
sure you

870
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,559
use this as sort of help to my help you

871
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:39,200
go from

872
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,600
point to point in navigating the cyber

873
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,919
security field

874
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,600
and now the next thing is to understand

875
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,919
gaps why and how all these matter

876
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:52,080
and what are the issues we face today

877
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,799
so we've already talked about this

878
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,640
digital technologies increasingly

879
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,399
feature in what we call the asymmetric

880
00:31:58,399 --> 00:31:59,440
warfare

881
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,600
what is asymmetric warfare they are

882
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,679
attacks by smaller countries

883
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,080
and less powerful countries and

884
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,000
non-state actors on larger

885
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,120
powerful states

886
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,000
so you can look at more at this in the

887
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,519
global risks report

888
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,000
from the world economic forum very

889
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,919
important point to remember is war zones

890
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,519
are now no longer limited

891
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,399
to a distinct geographic area because of

892
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:24,880
how

893
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,799
industrial systems are now connected on

894
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,360
cyber realm

895
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,919
cyber warfare can actually impact our

896
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,360
physical lives

897
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,039
and that's why i say war zones are no

898
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:39,039
longer limited to a geographic area

899
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,519
now here's the state and this is why

900
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,679
it's important for us to pay attention

901
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,000
to the cyber security workforce this is

902
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,279
a report from 2019 from ise squared

903
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,200
and the report clearly shows us that

904
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,960
there aren't enough people to monitor

905
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,679
prevent

906
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,960
and deter cyberspace

907
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,039
and this is a picture that you can see

908
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,120
by region by different regions of

909
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,679
the workforce gap in each of these

910
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,080
regions

911
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,080
and here's a very interesting statistic

912
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,600
that i thought i must share

913
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,880
um as a piece of data that is relevant

914
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,279
now this there is a global cyber

915
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,880
security index

916
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,960
and they rank countries based on several

917
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,000
factors you can

918
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,440
see what those factors are in the

919
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,440
methodology of the report i've

920
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,039
put in the link at the bottom of the

921
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,080
slide but according to the 2018

922
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,240
report india regionally in the

923
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,120
asia pacific region stands ranks 10

924
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,159
number 10

925
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,600
and globally it ranks 47 on global

926
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,200
cybersecurity index

927
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,080
ranking which means this tells us there

928
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,760
is a lot of work to do

929
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,120
for us to prepare to become much more

930
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,880
proactive and resilient as a country

931
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,760
to secure the resources and our people

932
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,880
and here's another graphic that has a

933
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,159
piece of data

934
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:08,879
i like giving you these pieces of data

935
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,480
because it makes more sense when you

936
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,320
look at facts

937
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,199
what this slide tells you is that the

938
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,159
potential

939
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,520
that females give us in terms of labor

940
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:19,918
force

941
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:23,280
is much higher compared to the potential

942
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,800
label force of men

943
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,359
and this is um quite consistent across

944
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,399
the different

945
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,320
income groups as you can see here and

946
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,839
i've marked it

947
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,599
with the red blocks here

948
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,599
so this effectively means that we must

949
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,839
match potential to workforce gaps

950
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,000
so you saw the previous slide where i

951
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,839
said that we don't have enough cyber

952
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,399
security professionals in our workforce

953
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,599
to protect and defend our countries and

954
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,839
here in this slide you're seeing that

955
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,440
there are women

956
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,400
available who are ready to contribute to

957
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,400
the workforce but we are not utilizing

958
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,000
their services and skills

959
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,960
in the right way there is a gap between

960
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,680
the supply

961
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,640
and the demand so we must close this gap

962
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,119
so why aren't we able to close these

963
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,119
gaps because there are barriers

964
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,280
what are those barriers now i haven't

965
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,720
tried to be very exhaustive

966
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,400
in listing out the barriers but here are

967
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,240
some of my favorites

968
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,280
women in stem now although

969
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,400
we think by if you if you try to google

970
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,280
data on

971
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,680
um women in science and technology

972
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,560
fields

973
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,960
we might be under an impression that

974
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,560
let's say a country like india

975
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,800
has many women in engineering streams

976
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,040
but that does not actually translate to

977
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,320
quality outcomes

978
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,040
in terms of workforce so there is still

979
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,079
a gap

980
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,720
but the fact being that globally we

981
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,760
still have

982
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,240
far less women in science and technology

983
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,040
fields

984
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,000
and without onboarding women into stem

985
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,680
fields we will not be able to

986
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,079
close the highly skilled workforce gaps

987
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,839
that cyber security requires

988
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,880
and without women already in the stem

989
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,960
fields we will not be able to mentor

990
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,760
women for future positions which means

991
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,240
it becomes our duty all the women that

992
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,119
are in the field today for example

993
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,320
someone like me

994
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,880
it becomes my duty to be available to

995
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,400
mentor other women

996
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,520
for future positions

997
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,000
and this is another graphic that's

998
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,839
really interesting it's from

999
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,160
a cyber crime magazine as you can see

1000
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,200
here

1001
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,800
is that they anticipate so this is the

1002
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,400
current state of women

1003
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,240
and they anticipate that we'll have

1004
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,359
roughly about 3.5 million women

1005
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,880
in by 2021 although no one might have

1006
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,240
anticipated

1007
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,760
the kovid 19 global pandemic which means

1008
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,200
all of the numbers that have been

1009
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,280
projected before 2020

1010
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,280
are literally um in a manner of skew now

1011
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,440
because of the pandemic so the numbers

1012
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,520
vary

1013
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,599
now here is another graphic that tells

1014
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,680
you the male versus female cybersecurity

1015
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,960
workforce composition

1016
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,320
by region so if you look at asia pacific

1017
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,839
there's only 10 percent

1018
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,320
of the population are female in

1019
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,800
cybersecurity workforce

1020
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,560
whereas if you look at north america

1021
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,079
although it's not very great but

1022
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,280
it's 14 so you have to

1023
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,079
look at all of this data to understand

1024
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,119
why

1025
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,440
having women in cyber security is such

1026
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,320
an important

1027
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,720
topic for us and why we have to really

1028
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,359
work towards it

1029
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,240
this is another graphic that that shows

1030
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:44,640
the

1031
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,920
ratio of men versus women

1032
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,320
in the types of roles that they do

1033
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,440
and then as you can see

1034
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,520
engineering data ai engineering and

1035
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,040
cloud computing

1036
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,040
it progressively gets lesser and lesser

1037
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,040
so you've got barely 12 percent

1038
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,760
of females working in cloud computing so

1039
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,000
these are some of the more granular

1040
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,800
data that you can look at to understand

1041
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,440
where

1042
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,400
gaps exist and what are those areas that

1043
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,800
you can potentially get into

1044
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,720
as you think about workforce joining the

1045
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,839
workforce

1046
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,760
and about learning skills that are

1047
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,359
relevant to help you

1048
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,640
get into that workforce

1049
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,800
here's another graph that tells um where

1050
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,280
are

1051
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,280
male and female distributed across

1052
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,720
different roles

1053
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,599
so you can see um the blue slice of pie

1054
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,400
that you see is a share of women

1055
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,040
across all of those roles that you see

1056
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,839
here

1057
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:47,359
and the rest is all dominated by men

1058
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,760
which means we really have a lot of work

1059
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,640
to do

1060
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,200
as women

1061
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,280
but it's not just about women not

1062
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,240
getting into stem

1063
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,640
enough or it's not about women not being

1064
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,079
in the workforce enough

1065
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,240
there are issues why women aren't able

1066
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,680
to get into stem

1067
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,480
and there are issues why women aren't in

1068
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,359
the workforce

1069
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,480
as we might want them to and one of

1070
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,359
those issues

1071
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,000
are comes around to gender

1072
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,119
discrimination

1073
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,839
and this is a a piece of data that you

1074
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,200
can see here

1075
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,079
that shows unconscious discrimination as

1076
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,079
a majority the major reason

1077
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,920
that women do not continue

1078
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,760
to um thrive in the industry

1079
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,680
and that's a pretty high number 87

1080
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,680
percent of unconscious discrimination

1081
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,640
what does it mean

1082
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,200
that means we don't even realize that we

1083
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,079
are discriminating

1084
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,359
women eighty-seven percent of women say

1085
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,599
think that that there is a lot of

1086
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,359
unconscious discrimination this is one

1087
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,359
of the most easiest and one that we can

1088
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:52,400
tackle by

1089
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,520
understanding that human as human beings

1090
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,599
we have bias and fallacies

1091
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,280
and by recognizing those bias and

1092
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,000
fallacies we can actually overcome

1093
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,880
some of this unconscious discrimination

1094
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,440
and then

1095
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,640
across the other factors we can

1096
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,560
definitely work through

1097
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,040
gender policies within our organizations

1098
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,400
within even within

1099
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,400
it and cyber security organizations to

1100
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,160
make sure that there are good gender

1101
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,880
policies

1102
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,359
to support women to support your

1103
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,280
colleagues women colleagues

1104
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,920
and mentor them and make sure that they

1105
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,400
feel

1106
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,560
wanted and invited as part of the team

1107
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,680
across different roles

1108
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,079
so some of the suggestions that i have

1109
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,880
is um

1110
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,599
we really have to mentor women we have

1111
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:42,720
to help them

1112
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,359
we have to recognize to begin with what

1113
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,800
are the barriers that women face

1114
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,599
and some of these barriers will be easy

1115
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:52,880
to tackle

1116
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,599
through policies and sometimes by

1117
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,280
education and awareness

1118
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,720
those are some of the easiest one that

1119
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,119
we can resolve but then there are the

1120
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,160
harder ones

1121
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,160
the harder ones are getting more women

1122
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,760
into stem

1123
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,160
even harder ones are in certain part of

1124
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,040
the culture

1125
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,920
perhaps a woman has difficulty staying

1126
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,520
in her field of work

1127
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,760
because either she's of a marriageable

1128
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,560
age

1129
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,200
or she needs to get married or she needs

1130
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,640
to have children

1131
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,960
there are different social and cultural

1132
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,680
norms

1133
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,920
that bind women to duties

1134
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,680
that the gender stereotypical duties

1135
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,720
that we ask of them so perhaps by

1136
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,480
becoming aware

1137
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,400
and creating policies that are much more

1138
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,599
conducive

1139
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,760
and women friendly we'll be able to have

1140
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,920
more women and retain more women in our

1141
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,560
industry

1142
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,599
in cyber security

1143
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,400
um i do have a few links at towards the

1144
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:50,800
end

1145
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,079
of this slide i put them in appendix but

1146
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,079
please do feel free to go through them

1147
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,160
because they are quite useful resources

1148
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,599
although i will not be going through

1149
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,640
them in our presentation here

1150
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,680
so i hope this brief overview of what

1151
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,760
industrial security is how cyber

1152
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,440
security is interconnected with our

1153
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,240
lives

1154
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,480
and now why this matters in our present

1155
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,359
context of

1156
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:17,040
industrial industry 4.0

1157
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,920
is relevant and especially relevant to

1158
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,640
women

1159
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,880
because the workforce lacks women

1160
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,640
visibly lacks women

1161
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,440
and then there are barriers that prevent

1162
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,599
women from coming into the workforce

1163
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,079
staying in the workforce if we address

1164
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:33,040
these barriers

1165
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,000
we will have more people available to

1166
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,880
defend

1167
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,040
the growing number of attacks that we

1168
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,760
face as we bring more and more devices

1169
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,000
onto the internet so i hope this is

1170
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,800
helpful

1171
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:51,040
and thank you very much for joining us
