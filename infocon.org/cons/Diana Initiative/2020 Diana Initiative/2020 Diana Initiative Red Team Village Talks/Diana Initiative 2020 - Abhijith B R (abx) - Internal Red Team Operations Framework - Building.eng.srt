1
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,160
hello everyone

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,759
good morning afternoon and good evening

3
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,400
the title of my talk uh would be uh

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,720
internal red team operations framework

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,600
building your practical internal writing

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,400
uh let's

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,920
move on to the intro slide my name is

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,039
abhijit

9
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,238
i'm also known by this euro name abx um

10
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,320
right now i'm leading offensive security

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,640
operations or in a global

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,680
fintech company uh formerly uh the

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,000
deputy manager for cyber security as

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,559
at nissan motor corporation prior to

15
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:45,280
that uh

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,039
i was working with ebay as a senior

17
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,640
security analyst

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,640
so i have more than uh 10 years of

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,879
experience in the information and

20
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,320
security domain i'm also the founder of

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,199
rectum village community uh no uh it is

22
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,960
not associated with uh you know

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,159
dc i'm also acting as the lead

24
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,520
organizer at uh defcon group tavantam um

25
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,159
i recently started running a blog called

26
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,040
tactical

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,000
dot io which is uh dedicated to

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,360
adversarial simulation and

29
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,400
returning tactics moving on to the

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,920
next slide so let's make some things

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,080
very clear first i don't really want to

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,159
do an introduction about vulnerability

33
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,000
assessment fantastic or you know

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,880
security assessments but i just wanted

35
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,759
to make some statements uh very clear

36
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,759
before we go ahead so

37
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,159
uh a couple of things are there you know

38
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,840
this just needs to be uh

39
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,560
you know clarified number one

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,560
vulnerability assessment it is not

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,520
redeeming

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,200
so you all know that right what is

43
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,799
vulnerability assessment

44
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,799
so it's like uh you know if you are

45
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,000
targeting a system

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,399
application or a network so we will be

47
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,920
listing out all the possible

48
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,360
vulnerabilities in there

49
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,600
and uh you know of the pocs for the

50
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,040
vulnerabilities how to remedy these

51
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,399
vulnerabilities everything would be

52
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:04,799
there

53
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,640
so that is what basically vulnerability

54
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,399
assessment mendes so again

55
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,000
vulnerability assignment it is not

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,680
redeeming

57
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,840
uh the next slide again fantastic it is

58
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,720
also not redeeming uh i'll tell you

59
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,760
something uh you know

60
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,560
pentesting on the other hand it is more

61
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,560
focused towards a goal

62
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,080
you know maybe we are targeting an

63
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,160
application or infrastructure

64
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,640
or only gold would be uh compromising

65
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,840
that system and

66
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,879
you know get access to that system so

67
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,000
the pendulum report

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,400
also reflects it should also reflect the

69
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,840
same rather than

70
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,879
listing all the vulnerabilities uh

71
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,760
because uh i'll tell you uh you know uh

72
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,120
the reason behind that

73
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,200
so we are facing a problem right now

74
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,640
nowadays they cannot

75
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,720
differentiate between uh vulnerability

76
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,800
assessment and pen testing reports

77
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,959
so usually uh vulnerability the

78
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,120
vulnerability assessment report

79
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,319
uh we are expecting it to be uh having

80
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,000
uh you know all vulnerabilities which

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,480
may be exist in the target system

82
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,560
a punishing report it may list all the

83
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,560
vulnerabilities in the target system

84
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,200
instead of uh you know the exploitation

85
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,599
and how the attacker got into the system

86
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,360
like you know the actual attack path

87
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,440
would be there so that would be the

88
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,599
core difference between va and pendulum

89
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,560
report

90
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,200
so you know also i used to see external

91
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,280
pen testing reports or you know with ssl

92
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,640
issues only like you know

93
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,879
instead of listing down the attack path

94
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,040
and how they got access to the system

95
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,959
and nowadays uh the modern fantastic

96
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,959
report they are only you know listing a

97
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:37,680
couple of

98
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,159
useless vulnerabilities not i'm not

99
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,680
supposed to say useless but

100
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,360
something like uh low severity

101
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,120
vulnerabilities instead of you know the

102
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,760
actual exploitation path

103
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,760
it is kind of confusing now you know we

104
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,879
cannot blame uh

105
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,599
anyone here uh you know uh by courting

106
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,640
them but if it is

107
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,840
but it is what happening nowadays i also

108
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,720
uh want to

109
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,760
uh point out once again pen testing is

110
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,239
also

111
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,200
not redeeming

112
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,080
next slide so we have a very cool

113
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,640
definition uh you know from the

114
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,599
redteams.net blog

115
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,159
it's like historically a team origins

116
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,599
from the military

117
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,079
tents which would imitate the role of

118
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,120
adversaries

119
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,720
or you know they will try to mimic

120
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,800
attacks against the military bases

121
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,600
or other targets so based on the outcome

122
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,280
like you know based on the

123
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,440
findings of which they had revealed you

124
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,199
know they would be

125
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,440
increasing the defense and uh security

126
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,280
measures at their base

127
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,840
so actually uh the the term red team it

128
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,360
came originally came from

129
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,600
military background

130
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,080
then we have you know another

131
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,320
explanation here this is also taken from

132
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:48,639
uh

133
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,440
you know redteams.net so in case of uh

134
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,199
that's a that's a very pretty

135
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,360
very very uh you know very very simple

136
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,479
explanation

137
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,720
error team is a group of highly skilled

138
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,680
people

139
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,240
that continuously challenge the plants

140
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,680
defensive measures

141
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,800
and security concepts that is that is

142
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,400
pretty simple

143
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,160
so in case of pen testing uh you know

144
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,160
there is a well defined target and a

145
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,639
gore

146
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,680
it is more into god oriented for example

147
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,479
an application

148
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,039
when it comes into red teaming uh this

149
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:19,680
is a

150
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,680
very much full scope adversarial

151
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,720
simulation

152
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,280
so the adversaries uh they could target

153
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,320
infrastructure

154
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,680
applications or surveys even employees

155
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,720
physical you know office promises etc

156
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,400
so they will have they will be having a

157
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,840
set of objectives

158
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,960
very hardcore objectives which will be

159
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,759
focused on

160
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,320
actual advanced attack scenarios or you

161
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,759
know they'll be working on they'll be

162
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,800
working based on

163
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,600
their goals based on their objectives

164
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,720
but which is

165
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,360
uh not similar to fantastic it's like

166
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,440
you know like it mentioned before

167
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,840
this is like you know full scope we are

168
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,360
not uh limited to

169
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,880
perform assessment against an

170
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,199
application or a server you know we are

171
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,080
targeting the organization you know in

172
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,600
every aspect of is

173
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,039
you know it's business continuity or

174
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,600
business or range

175
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,759
so this is also called uh adversarial

176
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,680
simulation uh along with the

177
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,400
time red team uh you know basically both

178
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,880
of the same that is what i believe

179
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,080
moving on to the next slide

180
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,199
i think uh you have seen this picture

181
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,840
right you know uh for example a security

182
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,080
sales guy from uh the security company

183
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,400
called

184
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,440
xac is saying that our red team will be

185
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,120
doing pen test and vulnerability

186
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,720
scanning for the clients

187
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,199
so usually the security services our

188
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,720
sales executives

189
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,039
are there doing this you know i'm not

190
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,639
knocking anyone here

191
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,720
it is also very sad that many people are

192
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,120
seeing the teams of fantasy interstates

193
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,240
so by you know by using the time

194
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,000
internal team there are they are

195
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
actually meaning internal fantasy

196
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,400
that is not true that is what i'm you

197
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,960
know trying to establish here

198
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,440
to explain the actual job along with the

199
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,639
team professional

200
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,360
you know for example their title is like

201
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:07,919
a

202
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,720
retime optional or a team operator so

203
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,840
along with that

204
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,840
many many security folks are also using

205
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,960
the time uh

206
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,440
adversarial simulation specialist or

207
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,800
adversarial simulation

208
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,440
uh you know professional uh in their uh

209
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,120
you know linkedin or resumes

210
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,120
so i have recently seen a couple of

211
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,919
similar job titles in linkedin.com

212
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,800
uh you know uh which which is using uh

213
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
the title uh adversarial simulation

214
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,160
instead of red tv

215
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,160
or instead of uh reclaiming tactics or

216
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,840
something like that

217
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,280
moving on to the next slide

218
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,039
so i really wanted to uh you know show

219
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,319
off this image

220
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,840
you know this is the perfect symphony

221
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,000
between attackers and the different days

222
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,759
you know the blue teams and uh

223
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,120
ratings so we created this picture

224
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,360
uh you know for there for a ctf

225
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,400
competition at a

226
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,319
conference called you know which is one

227
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,759
of the biggest cyber security conference

228
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,000
in

229
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,520
india so it was created based on the

230
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,479
uh native kerala martial art form color

231
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,120
repeat

232
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,560
this is something similar to you know

233
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,120
other martial arts but it is very old

234
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,800
uh you know it is traditional martial

235
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,160
arts uh in

236
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,680
in our location which is scala

237
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,599
i think uh you know you like this

238
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,520
picture you know we are also

239
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,440
allowing uh this picture to be

240
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,039
downloaded as a wallpaper

241
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,199
maybe i can share you that link as well

242
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,080
okay uh let's uh you know coming back to

243
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,279
the actual topic here

244
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,719
let's go and build a an internal vetting

245
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,799
so most of the things mentioned here it

246
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,839
is from uh

247
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,320
my own experience on the awesome

248
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,800
contributors of the security community

249
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,519
so let's say most of the computer i mean

250
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,560
so i'm sorry

251
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,160
let's say most of the companies are

252
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,320
there already have their own abstract

253
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,120
and internal pen to steam right so what

254
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,000
if they want to

255
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
uh move to a more matured attack

256
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,440
simulation activities

257
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,279
so they are already you know established

258
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,360
their active teams or internal

259
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,440
vulnerability assessment or pentax teams

260
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,279
so now it is the time to you know move

261
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,480
on to a more matured uh you know

262
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,480
offensive team a more matured attack

263
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,600
simulation or

264
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,560
adversary simulation team so i think uh

265
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,240
this talk would be helpful for such

266
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,240
people who are planning to

267
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,440
uh organize or implement such kind of

268
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,480
internal offensivity

269
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,240
uh you know here is a very cute uh

270
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,920
diagram uh this is still a working

271
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,800
progress

272
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,120
so we have created something called

273
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,040
internal team operations framework you

274
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,440
know which can be said as irtof

275
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,240
so we devised you know the the functions

276
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,720
or

277
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,839
or activities of internal offensive team

278
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,680
into uh you know five different phases

279
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,480
here

280
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,480
i think uh you know you guys seen this

281
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,240
maybe you guys have seen

282
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,920
the picture from superman movie or

283
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,440
something you know uh from the current

284
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,160
stage the

285
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,680
flying stage so uh we uh i mean we have

286
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,360
used uh you know uh

287
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,600
we took the idea from there and based on

288
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
that we have divided

289
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,360
the actual operations into five

290
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,959
different steps

291
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,160
uh moving on to the next slide uh i mean

292
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,600
the very first slide of

293
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,040
iit of the face on

294
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,360
crawling so this is a very very basic

295
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,240
step of

296
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,000
irto antenna the team operations

297
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,079
framework let's say building from the

298
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,600
scratch building the team from the

299
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,000
scratch

300
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,600
uh the very first thing would be uh get

301
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,399
the budget

302
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,000
approval so if you are planning to build

303
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,079
the team uh you know budget is always

304
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,760
important right so you need the budget

305
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,640
to

306
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,800
get the tooling uh you know hire the

307
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,240
talent and all those things

308
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,720
uh you know you need uh internal budget

309
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,959
to be approved so get the budget

310
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,079
approach

311
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,000
and defend practical goals and

312
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
objectives the objectives must be

313
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,200
crystal clear

314
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,600
because each organization has different

315
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,200
set of crown jewels

316
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
you know it may be their sensitive data

317
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,480
or their assets

318
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,000
their formulas you know their ips so

319
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,440
there is a difference between you know

320
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,040
each company

321
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,440
so it is uh you know the secondly uh you

322
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
know rules of engagement that is also an

323
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,120
important thing you know based on the

324
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,959
organization and their

325
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,200
uh you know cultural work culture that

326
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,000
may differ

327
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,959
that may differ it's like also you know

328
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,800
getting assistance from the legal

329
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,720
department and management that is very

330
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,480
very critical

331
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,240
uh then understand the secret the

332
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,480
current existing of you know security

333
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,320
post of your organization

334
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,920
uh because in order to have an interim

335
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,760
red team you need to find out what are

336
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,600
the security messages or

337
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,600
uh you know different systems which is

338
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,120
already there in your company already

339
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,360
there in your organization

340
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,200
it is always or you know not about

341
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,720
owning the domain admin or

342
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,440
obtaining domain name conventions it is

343
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,000
always

344
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,160
about the critical assets or crown

345
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,120
jewels of

346
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,120
of an organization or you know of your

347
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,399
organization

348
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,800
so the critical assets needs to be uh

349
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,920
identified uh

350
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,160
critical people needs to be identified

351
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,760
they are more vulnerable to an attack

352
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,320
right

353
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,480
so all these things comes under

354
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,639
understanding the security cost of the

355
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,120
organization existing security posture

356
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,160
and finally

357
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,720
hire the talent aka the red team that's

358
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,160
uh that's one of the

359
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,320
biggest stepping phase on hire the

360
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
talent because you need to

361
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,240
you need to have you know experienced

362
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,560
people so that you can you know

363
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,800
move on with the uh team implementation

364
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,480
right

365
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,000
next slide i think you have seen this uh

366
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,360
you know series of

367
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,079
the a team uh that is very very awesome

368
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,920
this is a very awesome series i really

369
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,959
like it

370
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,360
so it's like the team and skill set so

371
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,399
this is the

372
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,120
most important part to build an internal

373
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,320
team

374
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,000
because uh just imagine you have

375
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,519
everything you have touring you have

376
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,240
budget

377
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,079
you have like you know office very very

378
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,519
cool office premises

379
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,000
but uh you don't have uh the that i mean

380
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,560
uh

381
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,279
you don't have uh the very skilled

382
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,959
people uh you know and uh

383
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,959
in inverting tactics or address

384
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,160
assimilation so

385
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,240
that is not going to do well right so

386
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,079
this is very important this is the most

387
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,360
important part to build an internal

388
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,480
vector

389
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,880
so just look at 18 this is how a team

390
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,680
should be

391
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,839
the team must be diverse skilled in

392
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,160
different areas of attack simulation

393
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,600
or adversity so they will have to work

394
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,839
together as a team or watch solo

395
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,839
and work under you know ecstasy i want

396
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,279
to pressure because you know

397
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,240
you know this is very much important to

398
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,760
uh you know have the

399
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,079
ability to work under you know pressure

400
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,560
nowadays that is very important

401
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,880
as you know like uh carol hannibal you

402
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,560
know he is also a leader

403
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,440
and sometimes or he's also act as a solo

404
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,320
player

405
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,839
uh you know he get things done

406
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:48,000
single-handedly

407
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,279
the 18 they are strong individually

408
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,000
and they are stronger as a team so

409
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,800
that's how a tune should team should be

410
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,880
so each team member covers his teammates

411
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,560
weakness and you know other

412
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,279
other issues and you know enhances them

413
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,079
the team should

414
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,480
also contain non-technical people that

415
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,760
is also critical

416
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,320
because just imagine you know a hardcore

417
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,920
technical guy is writing

418
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,480
a phishing campaign or phishing campaign

419
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,199
email

420
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,920
against a bunch of business executives

421
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,160
because of being technical people

422
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,240
being technical guys you know we always

423
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,920
have the tendency to use

424
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,920
more tech jargon right you know we'll be

425
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,120
using a lot of

426
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,720
you know techno weights in you know in

427
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,560
our email so uh

428
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,240
if you are targeting uh your business

429
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,880
executives or other other normal people

430
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,480
uh it won't work that way you know they

431
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,160
will find it very hard to you know

432
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,839
connect to that made right

433
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,600
so it is always important to have

434
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,680
non-technical teams or non-technical

435
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,800
advices

436
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,440
within your team so that you know you

437
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,760
get an extra opinion from an outside guy

438
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,079
and

439
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,959
also you can use their skill set to you

440
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,040
know uh

441
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,279
a handful of things that is also

442
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,880
important

443
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,399
moving on to the next slide uh this is

444
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:02,720
the

445
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,199
phase two of uh irt internal rating

446
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,519
operation framework

447
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,160
uh it's like uh

448
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,560
so uh we need uh like you know a team

449
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,920
external infrastructure

450
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,720
uh that includes uh not only

451
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,079
infrastructure not only cloud

452
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:20,959
infrastructure

453
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,760
we also need uh you know domain names uh

454
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,839
you know uh email services email hosting

455
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:26,560
services

456
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,120
so and so uh that is uh you know

457
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,040
external info is essential to mimic an

458
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,959
adversary's action so that is very much

459
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,000
important

460
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,079
for the beginning uh you know uh just

461
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,759
start with open source c2s

462
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,440
open source or command and control

463
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,959
surveys implants

464
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,600
framework and other tools uh mode we can

465
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
modify these tooling uh you know based

466
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,240
on your requirement

467
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,199
and uh you know uh that's what is what

468
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,360
it says here you know corporate tools or

469
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,800
interface open source tooling

470
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,560
capabilities so you know you should be

471
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,440
able to

472
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,440
modify a couple of exiting open source

473
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,480
tools and you know

474
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,720
make it uh very useful for your current

475
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,040
your accessing scenario

476
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,360
next point would be uh always be friends

477
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,959
with your company's blue team

478
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,920
or company's cyber defense team it is it

479
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,639
is always

480
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,199
uh good to be uh in a good very good

481
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,639
relationship with your

482
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,440
companies or you know uh blue team or

483
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,440
security options too

484
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,839
because all of your adversarial actions

485
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,519
are you know they are

486
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,759
there to make the blue teams much

487
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,040
stronger than

488
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,920
stronger and enhanced you know whatever

489
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,560
you do

490
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,240
you know that you're not attacking your

491
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,399
own company right whatever vulnerability

492
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,040
or whatever

493
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,120
weakness or whatever misconfession you

494
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,519
find so that is there to

495
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,480
enhance the blue team's capabilities so

496
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,360
that is very much

497
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,839
important but once i try to be uh you

498
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,680
know friends with an organization so you

499
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,480
know blue team

500
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,360
you know aka security operation center i

501
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,600
think uh you know i had gone too far you

502
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,399
know

503
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,959
that is not supposed to happen and uh

504
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,880
you know she's my girlfriend now

505
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,440
that is very funny to you know think so

506
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,199
just take it an easy way you know

507
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,880
you can be friends with your blue teams

508
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,359
organize your organization blue team

509
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,439
but you know just keep it on a limit

510
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,839
okay this is just a fair warning from my

511
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,119
end

512
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,079
the next point so start with additional

513
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,199
emulation using

514
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,119
you know so-called open source spine

515
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,240
water we have atomic

516
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,520
team here we can cadre here so it's like

517
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,520
you know metra is your friend so they

518
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,120
have all the resources

519
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,679
in the world you know to help you with

520
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,120
adversarial emulation and

521
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,679
apt emulation so this would uh help you

522
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,120
to understand

523
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,200
the detection capabilities of your

524
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,559
antivirus and

525
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,120
area products along with your stock

526
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,120
implementation like you know log cooling

527
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,080
implementation

528
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,919
so how much of these activities are

529
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,360
being logged and being detected by your

530
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,520
uh blue team you know how many of these

531
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,880
attacks they're blocked by your

532
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,840
antivirus

533
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,600
how many of these attacks like you know

534
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,440
sensitive actions

535
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,640
was blocked by your edr software so

536
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,600
these kind of things

537
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,760
can be understand understandable from

538
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,720
you know

539
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,799
adversarial emulation or apt emulation

540
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,400
or you can also validate you know

541
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,559
current defense mechanisms with the

542
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,360
blue team or by the by the help of meter

543
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,600
attack matrix

544
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,080
the next point start with simple and

545
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,080
pretty common phishing campaigns against

546
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,919
your employees you don't have to

547
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,880
uh you know don't have to raise the uh

548
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,000
like quality here

549
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,960
just just start something simple maybe

550
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,880
easy to uh you know organized

551
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,200
from the from an employee's perspective

552
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,919
so just

553
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,440
just start simple and pretty common

554
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,760
fishing campaigns uh you could just uh

555
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,520
classify the ranks of your employees

556
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,679
based on you know their levels right

557
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,840
and you can try various levels of

558
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,280
phishing campaigns against your

559
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,320
companies

560
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,200
uh like you know organ of like employees

561
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,039
so it will help you to understand

562
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,360
the response from your victims so that

563
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,679
we can validate your organization has a

564
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,640
male or fishy size filtering of you know

565
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,919
for example

566
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,720
a web proxy or you know to filter or new

567
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,039
or

568
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,919
unorganized websites or there is a mail

569
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,919
filtering mechanism to filter

570
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,320
suspicious emails so you can validate

571
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,200
all these

572
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,120
uh you know security council security

573
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,480
meshes by

574
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,960
performing such kind of phishing

575
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,880
campaigns

576
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,360
you can also use uh these findings to

577
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,000
improve

578
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,120
the the existing defense mechanisms

579
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,160
uh just keep in mind that both systems

580
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,480
and

581
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,919
the people uh you know it needs to be

582
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,160
enhanced like you know people awareness

583
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,400
and systems of enhancement that needs to

584
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,320
be done here

585
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,320
uh next one would be uh external attack

586
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,080
surface discovery and mapping so

587
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,080
we know that i think most of the people

588
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,760
you know they know this part

589
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,840
so it is very much important to identify

590
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,360
the internet facing assets of your

591
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,039
organization or you know we should help

592
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,400
the addresses to

593
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,440
gain a foothold into your network so it

594
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,400
is always

595
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,679
a good thing to map the attack surface

596
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,840
on the construction of an addressable

597
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,080
you know

598
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,480
then descending a remination process to

599
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,080
altas issues so that should be there

600
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,760
that must be there you know

601
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,000
all these findings and all these issues

602
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,600
or this there must be

603
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,919
a very very defined remediation process

604
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,440
to take care of all these issues

605
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,360
now the phase three so this is where you

606
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,640
know we begin to work

607
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,080
as per our irto plan so you can use

608
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,559
improved tools techniques and procedures

609
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,120
so uh we know about the current section

610
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,320
security mechanism

611
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,360
uh from the face online too so what if

612
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,280
your organization is not allowing

613
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,960
partial or any other skills

614
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,320
because you are trying something

615
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,880
internal like you're trying to uh you

616
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,600
know

617
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,120
run some tools on uh like you know

618
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,520
assuming uh using an assumption scenario

619
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,240
in a usage laptop or a server

620
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,080
so what if you know your uh your

621
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,159
organization is not allowing the partial

622
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,440
or in your steps

623
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,240
so you can just try the next best thing

624
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,039
right

625
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,120
we should find the next feasible option

626
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,400
in this case

627
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,480
we can try unmanaged powershell you know

628
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,760
it may be the

629
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
defense teams are not considering the

630
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,360
use of unmanned porsche

631
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,480
so that is just the basic improvisation

632
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:20,799
of

633
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,280
existing tools and scenarios just to

634
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,320
make sure

635
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,640
what is the actual limit of your

636
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,320
security products

637
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,559
for example this blocking power shell

638
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,000
but if you are using unmanaged

639
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,720
powershell we are

640
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,640
we are able to execute powershell

641
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,280
commands right so that is not good right

642
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,840
so by doing this by you know doing step

643
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,000
by step modification and

644
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,240
step based upon you know testing we can

645
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,280
understand that

646
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,200
what is the actual capabilities of our

647
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,679
you know security implementation

648
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,080
so try to bypass your edr and antivirus

649
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,840
software continuously you know it would

650
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,520
benefit the defense team and

651
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,520
systems very much so that's also

652
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,280
important

653
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,480
to be considered in phase three so

654
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,880
from phase one to phase three uh we had

655
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,200
identified the crown jewels and people

656
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,559
account jewels and

657
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,600
key people right so these i mean there

658
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,000
should be

659
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,240
a wonderful path you know which leads to

660
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,520
the account jewels or

661
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,039
uh the key people maybe there's a

662
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,039
pitching campaign uh maybe

663
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,880
uh you know that's some weaknesses in

664
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,799
the in your activity infrastructure or

665
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,640
maybe your cloud implementation

666
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,360
so whatever it is the vulnerable path

667
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,880
towards these you know crown

668
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,240
jewels it needs to be fixed that is uh

669
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,679
you know that is uh

670
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,000
that's important so next thing

671
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,880
evaluation of

672
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,000
instant response process so this is also

673
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,280
important like you know what is the

674
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,200
organization's process once it's

675
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,159
been compromised how much time it did

676
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:46,799
take to

677
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,520
uh detect uh the incident and respond to

678
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,039
it you know the time

679
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,679
of the defense team uh you know uh taken

680
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:54,080
to

681
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,799
uh contain the actual uh incident the

682
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:57,760
actual bridge

683
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,080
so that is very much important because

684
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,880
um

685
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,840
we we always have to us you know assume

686
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,799
that

687
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,120
we had uh bridge somehow you know that's

688
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,080
a very

689
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,679
best strategy out there uh because um

690
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,760
also that is the importance of instant

691
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,720
response process

692
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,520
because what if we got compromised or

693
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,880
what if we got breached

694
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,960
what is our data would bridge what is

695
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,240
our next plan

696
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,240
how do we deal with this so everything

697
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,919
comes under this insulin response

698
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:26,640
process

699
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,799
along with the roles and responsibility

700
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,320
so

701
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,039
one of the goal of the red team should

702
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:33,760
be

703
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,760
testing out the instant response

704
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,600
management uh you know

705
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,679
process okay and

706
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,600
also we can perform automate adversary

707
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,760
emulation and automatic campaigns or

708
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,440
sustains can be done

709
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,919
and we can also perform automated

710
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,200
adversary emulation in

711
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,480
random surveys and machines on cinewile

712
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,279
just to assess our you know uh the the

713
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,480
security teams just

714
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,080
the blue teams their detecting

715
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,919
capabilities

716
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,480
uh also using the output of three

717
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,320
previous phases of phase one

718
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,760
two and now three we get improvise

719
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,240
and always make a new red team

720
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,480
operations process documentation

721
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,840
because from phase online two we have

722
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,600
learned a lot of things right you know

723
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,240
of the

724
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,279
our company is accessing um like you

725
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,200
know security mechanisms security

726
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,880
existing cyber defense or security

727
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,679
porsche

728
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,919
so based on that you know we also did a

729
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,840
couple of address reemulation and

730
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,600
campaigns and all those stuff right

731
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,080
so based on that we have a in a very

732
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,120
good list of

733
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,039
items with our you know in our

734
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,679
repository so using that

735
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,000
we can create an improvised you know set

736
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
of process documentation for

737
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,039
our internal team operations

738
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,559
moving on to the next slide

739
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,120
this is the face on irto start running

740
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,279
you know this is where we start running

741
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,960
in our framework

742
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,400
so the very first thing would be

743
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,000
collaborative and continuous

744
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,080
built-in exercise i think you guys

745
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,600
already know what is purple team is

746
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,159
right

747
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,000
so we need to have continuous and

748
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,720
collaborative exercises joining hands

749
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,640
with our blue team

750
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,799
uh because like i mentioned in the

751
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,240
previous slides

752
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,520
uh our uh our our extreme goal is to

753
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,240
uh you know enhance the cyber defense

754
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,520
capabilities right

755
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,320
so it is very important to organize

756
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,080
collaborative and continuous purple team

757
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,840
exercises

758
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,480
and enterprise to of course enterprise

759
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,600
tooling capabilities

760
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,919
so bring in more doing capabilities you

761
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,600
know many interesting platforms and

762
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,720
tools are in the

763
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,120
or out there we should empower you know

764
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,080
the team and

765
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,159
both the teams and blue teams because

766
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,440
there are many

767
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,279
uh ready-made tools right if you are

768
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,360
buying if you are like conquering that

769
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,159
tools

770
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,279
and using it instead your organization

771
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,600
you know the ready-made tools so you you

772
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,279
can verify like you know how much of

773
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,640
these tools can be

774
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,559
i mean the actions of these tools are

775
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,720
can be detected by the blue teams

776
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,240
because it's a ready-made tool right you

777
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,480
know it is supposed to get detected by

778
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,080
the blue teams and you know our cyber

779
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,760
defense softwares

780
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,919
so you can check that and you can also

781
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,440
use uh the

782
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,200
like you know the enterprise touring

783
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,480
capabilities to uh

784
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,440
extend your operations like you know on

785
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,679
a white skate

786
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,679
and you know targeted uh campaigns

787
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,760
against the counters and key people

788
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,240
in the face in the previous phases uh we

789
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,960
did some

790
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,880
you know pretty simple uh campaigns

791
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,559
against or the usage

792
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,159
just to make sure that what is their

793
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,320
response you know are they falling to

794
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,919
these kind of very simple phishing

795
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,440
campaigns or you know

796
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,679
are they reporting to uh you know uh

797
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:46,480
like uh

798
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,120
spam uh or putting it as a spam or

799
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:49,919
reporting it

800
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,200
to defense team so that things has been

801
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,159
done there

802
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,679
but here we can go for 30 focused and

803
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,279
targeted campaigns

804
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,440
against the business executives

805
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,000
leadership or the management

806
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,080
so we can ensure like you know how what

807
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,679
is the percentage of the people or

808
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:08,640
percentage of

809
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,720
the management folks you know who are

810
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,320
vulnerable to fishing campaign or

811
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,440
vulnerable to

812
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,840
targeted uh you know uh or spear

813
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,039
phishing campaigns

814
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,960
so there are many many awesome

815
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,880
frameworks are out there i would also

816
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,679
always

817
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,440
prefer to use custom uh you know

818
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,360
phishing campaign instead of using a

819
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,200
framework because most of the frameworks

820
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,399
and their headaches

821
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,720
will be detected by uh like you know the

822
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,320
security meshes and you know it will get

823
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:32,880
blocked

824
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,279
so always try to make something from the

825
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,480
from this crash

826
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,720
and try to uh you know do it in a manual

827
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,320
way so so that it will be more effective

828
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,559
so then our physical security assessment

829
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:45,440
or you know

830
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,000
it is like you know uh overt is like

831
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,520
you're not breaking anything you know

832
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,039
you're just uh

833
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,360
observing things and trying to find

834
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,960
physical security weaknesses

835
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,799
this like identify the most important

836
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,120
data center is manufacturing plans if

837
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,440
you are

838
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,080
you know like if you're into

839
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,039
manufacturing

840
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,120
uh processing center or anything based

841
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,320
on your company's business

842
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,120
business you know it may vary based on

843
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,799
debtors and these plans and you know

844
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,200
business and this so and so so you could

845
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,159
just go there

846
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,559
officially and you can work around the

847
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,480
premises or with the person in charge

848
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,600
maybe

849
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,679
maybe your supervisor or maybe your

850
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,840
teammates or maybe the person in charge

851
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,279
in that facility

852
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,919
so you can just more i mean roam around

853
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,000
observe the physical systems and you

854
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,880
know maybe

855
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,520
doors locks rfid uh you know entry

856
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,159
points

857
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,120
uh you know cctv cameras such things so

858
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:37,919
you can just

859
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,520
roam around and you can just perform

860
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,120
your review in front of or you know the

861
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,559
person in charge

862
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,320
that is called our physical security

863
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,679
assessment you are not

864
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,520
uh no it's like you know you don't get

865
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,360
to break any doors or load you don't get

866
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:49,840
to

867
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,919
clone our fairy clones uh maybe you can

868
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,039
check for that

869
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,440
rfid inner cloning vulnerability or you

870
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,640
know some kind of things

871
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,159
or you don't get to break anything

872
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,240
because you are doing it in in an hour

873
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,640
manner right so just to do a review to

874
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,159
identify the vulnerabilities in physical

875
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:04,880
systems and

876
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,600
report it so that is what mean by our

877
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,279
physical security assessments most of

878
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,159
the companies are doing it nowadays

879
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,720
so you can uh refer the work of deviant

880
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,080
olum uh in youtube

881
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,559
like you know he's a best out there uh

882
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:19,679
like in the

883
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,679
physical security assessments oh there

884
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,679
is a very his youtube channel

885
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,360
uh that would be a very good reference

886
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,720
for you

887
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,720
so also continuous training process for

888
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,559
operators and defenders because

889
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,200
most of the organizations uh they have

890
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,279
their own internal training programs and

891
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,799
certifications

892
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,279
for their employees especially the teams

893
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,520
in offensive security and you know

894
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,919
in the cyber defense teams asset so you

895
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,600
should also always have a plan

896
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,919
to train your employees into the you

897
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,200
know

898
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,799
i mean new certifications and new

899
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,399
training programs you should be there

900
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,399
also our proactive remediation process

901
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,080
and plan because in the previous

902
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,640
phases we did create a couple of

903
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,720
remediation plans right like you know

904
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,799
uh for example if the teams are coming

905
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,720
with a couple of findings a couple of

906
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,640
critical issues that needs to be

907
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,960
remediated within a certain amount of

908
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,919
time right

909
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,240
so in order to do that you should have a

910
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,760
proactive remediation

911
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,640
process and plan so by by the time we

912
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,159
reach phase four

913
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,760
because in the previous slide we

914
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,200
mentioned about creating a revelation

915
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,159
process right

916
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,039
so by the time we reach phase four so it

917
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:27,679
should be

918
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,120
more powerful like you know more

919
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,039
proactive compared to the previous

920
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,240
uh remediation process so there is an

921
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,840
operational security tip

922
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,240
regarding our security physical security

923
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,279
assessments

924
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,360
so do not uh if you're going to the uh

925
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,120
you know your office or i mean your

926
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,559
company's uh

927
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,200
like you know like officers or in other

928
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,159
locations

929
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,240
do not show up in a military pulse or a

930
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,480
you know or with a tactical backpack

931
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,440
or a laptop with full of stickers so i

932
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,960
do not uh you know

933
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,039
go into the client side or you know

934
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,480
wearing any of this

935
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,480
it replaces a lot of eyebrows even if

936
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,600
you are doing

937
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,840
uh an award physical security assignment

938
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,880
then just

939
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,200
imagine about or you know how that would

940
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,799
be if you are doing uh

941
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,360
i know what a a covert or you know

942
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,279
physical security

943
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,360
so always just you know make sure to

944
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,600
trust accordingly

945
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,760
so i have to your phase five welcome to

946
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,880
the fifth phase

947
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,600
it is the time to blow your angel wings

948
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,039
and fly away

949
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,159
so this is the step this is the phase

950
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,559
uh where we would have matured team

951
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,080
operations

952
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,480
so uh it's like by the time you should

953
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,279
have uh

954
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,440
by this time by the way you reach phase

955
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,039
five you should have

956
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,679
or you must have significant improvement

957
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,279
in your organizational

958
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,480
organizations security posture it's like

959
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,679
both systems and

960
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,559
people like you know um the improvement

961
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,320
of security i mean the security

962
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,240
improvement uh you should

963
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,279
cover the people as well of the systems

964
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,399
in your organization so skyler

965
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,799
highly skilled operators you know uh by

966
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,559
the time you reach 55

967
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,519
uh you you should also have you should

968
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:10,640
also reach a

969
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,559
level where your operators are highly

970
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,480
skilled in different set of

971
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,480
adversarial simulation and you know

972
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,640
teaming activities

973
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,440
uh next point will define purple team

974
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,000
model

975
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,640
to measure the progress of red team and

976
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,960
gluten capabilities

977
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,399
so again this should help the management

978
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:31,919
to understand

979
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,840
the gaps which are there in the

980
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,720
organization's security portion

981
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,720
uh there is like what is the what are

982
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,000
the activities

983
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,720
done by the team what are the activities

984
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,159
of you know done by the

985
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,720
blue teams what are the new weaknesses

986
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,679
which was

987
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,080
uncovered by the teams and what is

988
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,840
actual coverage for the

989
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,159
blue team so there should be a very

990
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:55,039
matured

991
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,760
set of you know a panel like you know

992
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,039
let's say matrix

993
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,519
to identify to measure the progress of

994
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,559
each team

995
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,039
and their complaint exercises so it

996
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:05,760
should be there

997
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,880
by the time we reach phase five next

998
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,399
point

999
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,480
uh covered physical security uh

1000
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,799
assessment so you can also start doing

1001
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,640
the covered security assessment uh by

1002
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,399
the time you reach face file

1003
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,519
so i have added the covert assessment in

1004
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,919
phase five only because a couple of

1005
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,519
reasons are there

1006
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,159
some uh organizations uh they have some

1007
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:29,519
difficulties to

1008
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,080
allow their employees uh to do covert

1009
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,200
assessments

1010
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,360
uh you know the team model needs to be

1011
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,399
used to end

1012
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,760
the trust and uh confidence of the

1013
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,799
management

1014
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,799
uh then you can move on to the covered

1015
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,480
sector adjustment uh that would be a

1016
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,240
better approach it is not

1017
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,440
um you know recommended to uh like

1018
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,360
jump into covert or physical security

1019
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,120
assessment from phase online page 2

1020
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,080
onwards

1021
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,399
always just wait to uh you know gain the

1022
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,159
confidence and trust of your

1023
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,360
management um you know gain some

1024
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,600
skill in i mean put some skill into your

1025
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,799
team operations

1026
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,519
then move on to uh covered security

1027
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,440
cloud physical security estimate

1028
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,280
that is always an you know recommended

1029
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,719
model

1030
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,960
so custom tooling capabilities or custom

1031
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,800
tooling capabilities in the sense

1032
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,040
internally developed command and control

1033
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,320
you know platforms

1034
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,359
or custom implants very specific exposed

1035
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,359
to uh you know exploits

1036
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,320
and uh custom scripts to automate uh the

1037
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,320
operations within your organization

1038
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,560
so these capabilities must be there uh

1039
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,440
by the time

1040
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,199
you know you start to fly and

1041
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,679
continuous advisory simulation uh to

1042
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,480
keep

1043
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,918
uh the different days on their toes uh

1044
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,159
it's like uh you know just control it as

1045
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,520
a normal game

1046
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,320
it's a game a regular game uh which you

1047
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,159
you would play with your friends like

1048
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,199
you know you guys are

1049
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,359
detecting issues and uh the blue teams

1050
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,560
are

1051
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,200
enhancing the coverage and you're coming

1052
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,800
with coming up with something

1053
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,560
some something new like you know some

1054
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,720
ways to maybe for example some ways to

1055
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,960
bypass the edr software or some

1056
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,680
um some techniques to some tools or

1057
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,720
techniques to

1058
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,720
uh bypass the monitoring capabilities or

1059
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,800
routines so just cancel us again

1060
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,720
you know there should be a continuous

1061
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,520
rdc simulation and emulation

1062
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,760
to keep the different days you know

1063
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,440
updated or you know that is very

1064
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,920
important

1065
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,400
and continuous rto

1066
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,640
uh you know with well defined process so

1067
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,160
because we are

1068
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,720
uh what what are we doing from phased on

1069
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,680
onwards

1070
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,400
we are creating we have created a rta

1071
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,240
process in phase one and phase two

1072
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,440
and by the time we reach these phases we

1073
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,560
are making it much

1074
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,480
better and better right you know we are

1075
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,640
just uh you know sharpening it

1076
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,920
our uh internal rtr process so just

1077
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,200
repeat the process

1078
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,760
make this process cycle uh like you know

1079
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,400
continuous

1080
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,400
team operations with a well-defined

1081
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,520
process

1082
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,599
uh just like i mentioned uh and just

1083
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,280
like i mentioned earlier

1084
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,960
this framework is still a working

1085
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,480
progress like you know

1086
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,480
there may be some things or which i am

1087
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,560
missing i will add more and more

1088
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,119
stuffing

1089
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,440
you know here to uh make the framework

1090
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,520
look much better it's like uh

1091
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,920
i'm also trying to uh you know make some

1092
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,320
some kind of uh

1093
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,320
like you know model uh to make it uh

1094
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,320
very much use make it very much useful

1095
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,480
and uh usually for the both the teams

1096
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,839
and bluetooth you know so that

1097
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:34,960
they can build a team uh internally and

1098
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,560
monitor the progress

1099
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,240
so moving on to the next slide

1100
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,320
so this is also uh very very much

1101
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,520
important we have

1102
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,400
strategy plans and tactical plans so

1103
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,240
strategy plans are focusing on

1104
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,640
long-term objectives right so where the

1105
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,240
tactical banks focuses on

1106
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,920
short-term engagement short-term

1107
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,359
tactical engagement

1108
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,359
so you can derive a couple of tactical

1109
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,599
plans and chain them together

1110
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,040
to reach a strategical plan for example

1111
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,480
uh in here our strategical plan is to

1112
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,520
have a matured team operations

1113
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,800
within your organization right so we can

1114
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,880
in order to achieve that long-term

1115
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,119
objective or long-term goal

1116
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,040
you can devise a couple of tactical

1117
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,280
plants so in our case

1118
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,560
tactical plants are each phasers so ioto

1119
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:26,880
has

1120
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,880
different faces right phase one to phase

1121
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,760
five so each faces can be considered as

1122
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,520
a tactical plant

1123
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,560
so in order to reach you know a long

1124
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,680
long time goal just take a tactical plan

1125
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,800
for example we are taking uh face on we

1126
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,720
can consider that as a tactical pan

1127
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,000
on so we are taking tactical pan one

1128
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,160
and we are giving it as time frame maybe

1129
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,400
let's say uh three to six months for

1130
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,839
example

1131
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,400
so with within three to six months we

1132
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,280
will be covering

1133
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,640
all the items mentioned in tactical plan

1134
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,839
on which is

1135
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,880
irto face on we are calling right so all

1136
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,000
these uh items

1137
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,640
all these activities listed in there we

1138
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,839
can take them

1139
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,320
and we can complete them on a time frame

1140
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,119
start with

1141
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,720
you know start from three months to six

1142
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,599
months so after finishing that tactical

1143
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:18,320
plan

1144
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,880
we can move on to the next phase phase

1145
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,200
two which is statical point two

1146
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,440
so like that you know you can achieve

1147
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,200
your long-term objective you know based

1148
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,800
on your organization's

1149
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,040
uh current security porsche and

1150
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,800
constructing the business activities and

1151
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,760
other things

1152
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,320
you can always devise your own plan like

1153
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,760
you know how much time

1154
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,240
uh which will it will which is needed to

1155
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,359
uh you know

1156
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,440
have a fully mature team or

1157
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,880
international team operations

1158
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,800
or fully matured internal offensive

1159
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,160
security operations

1160
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,079
so you can set that as a strategy plan

1161
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,320
like you know a long time objective

1162
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,560
and you can also use always use the face

1163
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,920
onto phase five

1164
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,320
these steps to create tactical fans and

1165
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,200
based on that

1166
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,359
you know we can move step by step right

1167
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:02,240
so that is the

1168
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,359
point of creating uh these uh

1169
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,280
five phases of internal rating

1170
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,520
operations

1171
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,240
and uh moving on to the next slide

1172
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,119
ah now this is the time for uh q one day

1173
