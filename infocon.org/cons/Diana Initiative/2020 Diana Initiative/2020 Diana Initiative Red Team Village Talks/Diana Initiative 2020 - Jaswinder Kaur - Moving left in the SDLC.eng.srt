1
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:12,799
okay

2
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,040
today i'm going to talk about web

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,239
application security

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,920
risk involved in web application

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,359
security and

6
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,920
how we can improve the security in web

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,560
applications

8
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,920
uh something about me i'm a senior

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,960
security engineer at t-mobile washington

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,600
prior to that i worked in dc government

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,280
and bank of america

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,360
i have expertise in web application

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,559
security testing

14
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,040
architecture risk analysis vendor

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,680
assessment

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,840
and security training solutions

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,480
like i said my agenda for today is to

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,600
talk about how

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,399
software and the software complexity is

20
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,320
increasing and how security needs to

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,680
catch up

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,480
risk and breaches and how we need to

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,199
improve

24
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,920
and uh application security risk the

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,000
solution which i'm proposing is

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,840
which we all are doing but we are still

27
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,280
missing a lot of things

28
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,960
how to do it right we're going to talk

29
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,280
about talking about moving left in the

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,400
stlc

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,920
and then we'll be going through all the

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,320
phases of sdlc

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,920
and then after that if you have any

34
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,840
questions we can obviously talk about

35
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,080
those

36
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,479
there was a time when last software

37
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,479
application used to take long time to

38
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,640
complete which is not the case today

39
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,040
agile streams can deliver application

40
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,200
software in weeks and days now

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,600
speed of software development has

42
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,439
increased and so are the software

43
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,079
security

44
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,560
risk development team is focused on

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,720
speed and pushing applications into

46
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,000
production

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,479
which sometimes committing causing like

48
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,600
hundreds of commits

49
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,680
every day organizations are taking

50
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,280
advantages of cloud

51
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,320
platforms on demand services and

52
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,000
continued delivery pipeline

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,079
all of these are basically increasing

54
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,399
delivery cycle time

55
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,079
but the main question is where is

56
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,000
security in all of these

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,600
what does security look like in the

58
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,160
world of continuous change

59
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,720
and how can security team can possibly

60
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,959
keep up with all these changes

61
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,280
we do have some gating control in place

62
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,680
we have security testing we have das

63
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,920
which is my bread and butter we have

64
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,520
penetration testing

65
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,040
but are these all sufficient

66
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,680
let's talk about some stats verizon

67
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,560
recently published its 2020 data breach

68
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,840
investigation report

69
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,680
dbir report which analyzed 32 000

70
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,040
security incidents

71
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,599
in 16 different industries and four

72
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,120
different world regions

73
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,920
majority of these breaches 86 percent of

74
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,239
them

75
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,640
are financially motivated more 70

76
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,840
percent are caused by

77
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,040
outsiders and most important

78
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,040
the worth noting fact is this

79
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,560
application were part of

80
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,599
more than 43 percent of breaches

81
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,280
more than the double the amount from

82
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,519
last year dbir found

83
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,280
that the cause of the increase in web

84
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,800
application breaches

85
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,519
was a result of more people moving their

86
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,319
workflows

87
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,360
to the cloud there was another report

88
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,680
which was stated in state of software

89
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,560
security

90
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,560
which found out that retail industry 40

91
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,680
of applications are only scanned once a

92
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,080
year

93
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,959
can you imagine that only once a year by

94
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,799
increasing the number of scams the

95
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,959
retail industry could find

96
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,000
and remediate more flaws and address

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,879
security issues the higher the

98
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,319
percentage of british

99
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,720
breaches will the applications were the

100
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,319
primary attack vector

101
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,879
this shows us that improvement requires

102
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,720
an application security

103
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,040
this is how the critical criticality is

104
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,798
there in the application security

105
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,360
now i'm going to talk about application

106
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,959
security risk

107
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,200
in the light of current pandemic with

108
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,879
more and more businesses

109
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,680
undergoing digital transformation number

110
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,360
of web application breaches

111
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,760
will definitely likely to increase no

112
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,280
doubt in that

113
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,519
application security is becoming an

114
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,399
important priority for all organization

115
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,399
whether you are a multinational company

116
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,560
like netflix or twitter

117
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,560
if your business is online web

118
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,160
application is important

119
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,320
even if your small mom and pop store if

120
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,000
you're going online this is important

121
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,639
for you

122
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,199
it's your customer data it's your brand

123
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,080
value which is at stake

124
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,160
third developments in web applications

125
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,560
and services have improved the way

126
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,479
that company used to do business like 10

127
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,400
years ago or 20 years ago

128
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,720
they have also increased the risk of

129
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,560
malicious attack as well

130
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,720
simply put the current weak link and

131
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,000
most organization

132
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,160
is the application security which is a

133
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,759
main important discussion we are going

134
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,280
to have right now

135
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,040
let's think does everybody in the

136
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,360
organization know that how many apis you

137
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,160
are using

138
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,479
do you even know what data is being

139
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,320
shared in those apis

140
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,320
and how it's being shared how your

141
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,400
customers your partners or vendors are

142
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,320
using those api

143
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,800
many organization are not even keeping

144
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,759
their api

145
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,240
inventory up to date and if you're not

146
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,000
aware of your apis

147
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,479
how will you protect secure and monitor

148
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,280
it

149
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,160
you need to enter all your apis and api

150
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,039
registry

151
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,639
whether it's new api old api ask your

152
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,199
application security team to find those

153
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:39,840
apis and assess them as well

154
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,000
over here i'm talking about application

155
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,280
security risk

156
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,360
it's important for everyone to know

157
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,759
about some common application security

158
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,400
issues

159
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,199
such as broken authentication exercise

160
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,360
sensitive information disclosure

161
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,840
injection session management i know a

162
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,840
lot of us are familiar with all of these

163
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,520
so i'm not going into detail all of

164
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,600
these on all of these issues

165
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,759
but yes i'm going to highlight over stop

166
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,440
then here which is a top 10

167
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,160
vulnerability

168
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,000
and it's an industry standard we have to

169
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,479
cover those

170
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,280
so what is moving lessons sdlc

171
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,039
let's talk about what's happening in the

172
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,120
organizations organizations are trying

173
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,880
to secure the application

174
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,440
they're following industry standard best

175
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,319
practices

176
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,560
to invest in penetration testing with

177
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,240
application firewall

178
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,680
but despite these efforts many apsec

179
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,880
initiatives fall short and they fail to

180
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,120
adequately secure business critical

181
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,560
functions

182
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,600
so what to do the best solution is to

183
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,160
use a secure software development

184
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,199
lifecycle

185
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,240
secure stlc and start security

186
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,039
discussion

187
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,240
right from the design phase so

188
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,319
whether you are developing application

189
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,440
in-house

190
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,599
outsource development or purchasing

191
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:00,639
application from

192
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,120
outside window you must be able to

193
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,840
ensure

194
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,240
that secure development practices are

195
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,560
being followed

196
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,440
interestingly there are many studies

197
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,400
that shows

198
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,840
it's faster easier and cheaper to find

199
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,039
and fix secure

200
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,360
software issues early in the development

201
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,560
cycle

202
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,120
when coders are actually writing their

203
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,759
code

204
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,000
rather than waiting in the testing on

205
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,120
the qf phase

206
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,960
and in the production hopefully we are

207
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,800
not doing that in production

208
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,199
but yes we it's important to assess your

209
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:33,919
application

210
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,840
and the early stages of the sdlc cycle

211
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,840
security should be baked into the

212
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,479
process from the start

213
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,080
so we need to move left moving left

214
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,720
eliminate

215
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,840
unnecessarily workload instead of fixing

216
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,479
the issue

217
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,199
identified in penetration testing which

218
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,000
happens

219
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,720
after your code is already in production

220
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,680
development team

221
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,199
should work instead in the earlier cycle

222
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,120
to find security vulnerability

223
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,520
security team should be involved from

224
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:12,639
the start of the sdlc cycle

225
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,720
here i'm talking if you can see on a

226
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,120
slide here are the different phases of

227
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,720
sdlc cycle

228
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,240
each step in the sdlc requires its own

229
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,840
security enforcement and tooling

230
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,919
from design to the test to the

231
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:28,960
deployment

232
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,919
each phase is extremely important and we

233
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,519
have to make sure we are following

234
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,320
security in each and every phase

235
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,719
i'm going to walk you through each and

236
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:39,760
every phase

237
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,159
and we will talk about how application

238
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:42,880
team

239
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,959
and security engineer have to work

240
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:45,920
together

241
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,640
to achieve the common goal of defense in

242
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,440
depth

243
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,080
and secure your application and customer

244
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,839
sensitive data

245
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,680
security requirements should cover

246
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,839
security policies mechanism

247
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,080
to enforce those security policies

248
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,160
authentication authorization

249
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,399
so you don't have to wait you need to

250
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,560
involve your security engineer right

251
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,920
from the design phase

252
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,959
right from the beginning

253
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,200
let's talk about the design phase first

254
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,080
it is critical to involve security team

255
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,480
to review the design document perform

256
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,680
threat modeling

257
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,320
write down all the security requirement

258
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,240
that needs to be considered

259
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,399
it is extremely critical when

260
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,560
application requirements are defined

261
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,440
the corresponding security requirements

262
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
should also be defined

263
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,480
yes that's where we are lacking

264
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,320
security requirement should cover

265
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,920
security policies

266
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,600
cia mechanism to enforce those policies

267
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,080
so you don't have to wait it means you

268
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,320
should involve a security engineer

269
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,399
when you're creating a design document

270
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,920
and i'm repeating here because it's

271
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,760
really really important

272
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,600
security engineer will review your

273
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,800
design document

274
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,959
work with the application team to

275
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,959
improve the security posture of the

276
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:05,440
entire

277
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,800
application so let's talk about

278
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,200
what a security engineer gonna do so

279
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,040
there are common questions the security

280
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,560
engineers gonna ask about

281
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,279
and about the development team about the

282
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,399
application

283
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,120
so on this let's go to next slide first

284
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,279
on this slide you can see a list of few

285
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,160
questions

286
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,880
which you need to think about and most

287
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,959
importantly security engineer

288
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,519
will ask you these questions while doing

289
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,600
a design review of your application

290
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,880
so the first question is is there a data

291
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,560
flow architecture diagram of an

292
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,519
application

293
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,760
and you'll be like it seems so simple

294
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,920
right but it's not

295
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,399
that's where we are missing i hate to

296
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:52,959
say

297
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,600
not all applications have a data flow

298
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,560
diagram

299
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,560
and i'm not talking about legacy

300
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,680
application

301
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,079
it's extremely important to have a data

302
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,000
flow architecture diagram

303
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,399
you need to understand all the entry

304
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,079
points of your application

305
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,240
you need to know all the components

306
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,120
involved

307
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,720
and assess them individually

308
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,120
next is you need to know what is the

309
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,519
data classification is it restricted is

310
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,560
it confidential

311
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,839
is it pci so if it's going to be

312
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:24,720
restricted

313
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,079
if it's involving ssn yeah if

314
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,880
uh if you have date of birth if you have

315
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,680
billing information it's all restricted

316
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,000
if there is a payment history your

317
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,040
credit rating

318
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,320
then it's pci information if you are

319
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,000
dealing with the

320
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,560
ein number your ipn number then it's

321
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,040
your

322
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,839
confidential information depending upon

323
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,680
the type of the data you are dealing

324
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,000
with

325
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,880
you need to have controls in place and

326
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,160
the main reason

327
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,800
why we are discussing this because you

328
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,680
need to set

329
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,839
appropriate controls based on the

330
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,160
classification of your data

331
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,880
you will be surprised to know how many

332
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,920
developers

333
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,240
keep the confidential information in the

334
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,079
plain text

335
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,800
so imagine if you're a hacker and you

336
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,279
found

337
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,560
unencrypted credit card information

338
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,839
yes it's unencrypted it will it will

339
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,160
make

340
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,639
hacker's job super easy he doesn't need

341
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,240
to do anything

342
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,639
think about it think about it when that

343
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,800
credit card information is stolen

344
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,839
it's attacked as an attacker's hand

345
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,079
so how what about customer trust and

346
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,200
business it's impacted big time

347
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,160
so what we need to do so it's if it's

348
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,279
confidential data

349
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,639
you should encrypt it and not only that

350
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,880
you need to make sure you are using

351
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,880
latest algorithm

352
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,440
because obsolete algorithms are not

353
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,000
going to help

354
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,399
you obsolete algorithm have their own

355
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,600
security flaws

356
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,720
which make them insecure and vulnerable

357
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,959
so you have to make use of latest

358
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,599
algorithm

359
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,480
so next we talk about if there are any

360
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,000
apis involved

361
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,360
how those apis are exposed so if your

362
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,200
application has apis so let's say yes

363
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,040
you have those apis so the question

364
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,600
comes is

365
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,399
is it intended for internal use external

366
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,279
use or

367
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,120
how who is going to access those apis

368
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,000
who's the end user

369
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,639
so it is intended for internal use it

370
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,040
should not be exposed to public

371
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,079
in my experience i have seen many

372
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,720
internal apis which were exposed to

373
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,680
public

374
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,360
yes it sound crazy right some of those

375
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,399
api had restricted information

376
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,120
and as it has a restricted information

377
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,160
it was a high

378
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,680
critical security issue sorry about that

379
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,399
how critical security issue to expose

380
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,160
those internal apis

381
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,360
any hacker could have it easily exploit

382
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,279
those apis over the internet

383
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,800
and since this has a restricted

384
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,720
information is a biggest impact on the

385
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,440
business

386
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,880
and and the brand value of course i have

387
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,920
seen many application owners who don't

388
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,920
know they are unaware of the security

389
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,399
what they are doing is they are exposing

390
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,360
this api

391
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,519
so that their third-party vendor can

392
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,880
access it

393
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,160
because they that's the reason they

394
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,480
think about it but in that case

395
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,480
what you can do if you have a similar

396
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,600
scenario

397
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,160
you should set some restrictions based

398
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,760
on ip address

399
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,800
only those provision ip addresses can

400
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,560
access those apis

401
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,560
nobody else if your api

402
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,399
is intended for external use for public

403
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,440
use

404
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,279
make sure it's behind your web

405
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,959
application firewall

406
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,000
it should also be registered in your api

407
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,199
inventory record now

408
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,399
let's talk about vendors are vendors or

409
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,839
third party involved within that

410
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,880
application

411
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,880
did those vendors have a security

412
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,800
evaluation

413
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,800
interesting questions right this is a

414
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,600
blind spot in many organizations

415
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,680
not just the new vendors you are dealing

416
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,959
with if there is an

417
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,199
old vendor you are working from last

418
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,120
five or let's say 10 years

419
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,360
you have to make sure there's a security

420
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,720
engineer assigned

421
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,600
to perform vendor assessment on that if

422
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,240
there is an

423
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,000
old contract that doesn't have a

424
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,440
security requirement

425
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,079
then you have to make sure your supplier

426
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,040
management team

427
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,600
can renew contract only when there is a

428
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,720
security requirement in place

429
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,720
that's where your security engineer will

430
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,320
help you

431
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,800
just like your internal application when

432
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,560
they have to go through the regular

433
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,240
testing design reviews

434
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,480
penetration testing because it's your

435
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,240
customer data at the end

436
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,720
and it has and you are the company as a

437
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,079
company you have to review

438
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,839
that vendor is doing what they are

439
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,240
supposed to do

440
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,959
now let's talk about is there a regular

441
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,079
patch management

442
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,880
code scan internal external testing been

443
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,000
done

444
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,320
so you have to ask the application owner

445
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,600
when was the last time

446
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,040
the application was assessed

447
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,320
is it the part of the patch management

448
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,199
if it's not

449
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,560
it's a red flag same goes to the regular

450
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,199
white box testing and annual penetration

451
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,880
testing

452
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,560
there's a general recommendation

453
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,120
industry-wide that you should always do

454
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,079
patch management

455
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,720
once a month uh now we are actually

456
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,519
going

457
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,399
more frequent uh that's actually the

458
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,240
bare minimum once a month

459
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,240
white box vulnerability management

460
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,000
quarterly and annual penetration testing

461
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,720
similarly there are many other things i

462
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,800
can talk about

463
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,399
there are big lists you can see right

464
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,079
now i can go launch

465
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,399
in each and every uh list the many other

466
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,920
questions which are very important and

467
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,120
you have to ask

468
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,800
your application owner like

469
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,360
infrastructure your network security

470
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,160
your authentication method the big list

471
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,359
i'm not going through

472
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,880
all of the lists because the time

473
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,799
constraint but yes that's really

474
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,079
important to think in mind

475
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,679
okay so next move to the next

476
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,240
build phase

477
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,359
this is a time when developers start

478
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,799
writing their code

479
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,200
there are many plugins which can be used

480
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,840
to find

481
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,720
security flaws right away it's essential

482
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,280
to assess security code regularly

483
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,919
and the best way is to integrate code

484
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,120
scanning with ci

485
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,559
cd pipeline which means every time

486
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,919
you build you commit a code a new scan

487
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:46,640
will be done

488
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,000
and new issues will be identified

489
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,559
code scanning is really really important

490
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,240
many high critical issues

491
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,960
such as hard-coded password can be

492
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,880
identified in the code scanning

493
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,080
right in the build phase fixing such

494
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,799
issues a lot quicker in the build phase

495
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:05,440
without

496
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,799
causing any delay in the release cycle

497
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,880
fix some issues identified in the source

498
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,559
code is really really important because

499
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,919
it's a low hanging fruit

500
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,600
you really don't want to miss it because

501
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,200
it has a really high

502
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,400
potential risk impact

503
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,360
industry wide number of core scan issues

504
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,720
are generally higher

505
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,320
when you compare it with your web

506
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,000
application your penetration

507
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,880
testing but it is critical to address

508
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,000
those findings

509
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,360
and verify if it's fixed or not and most

510
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,120
importantly we have to make a

511
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,480
plan to fix any open issues you have to

512
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,240
track those issues have

513
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,120
slas someone should be accountable for

514
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,640
those potential risk

515
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,799
otherwise it will never get fixed

516
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,120
another critical thing in this phase is

517
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,760
to give security awareness training

518
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,880
to the deaf team educate them educate

519
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,000
them about the security best practices

520
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,320
it's it's your job at the end you're a

521
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,080
security engineer

522
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,720
many a time deaf teams are not aware of

523
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,160
key risk factor

524
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,080
then they know they don't know what the

525
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,280
risk involved with the

526
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,320
data security privacy some employees are

527
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,280
misinformed

528
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,559
confused ignore it yeah

529
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,559
many don't understand that cyber

530
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,919
security is their personal

531
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,120
responsibility

532
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,360
and even there are few they don't even

533
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,240
know about

534
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,400
sensitive data privacy best practices

535
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,160
which is really important

536
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,360
security is everybody's responsibility

537
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,919
even a small mistake can have bigger

538
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,440
consequences

539
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,679
so that's why security awareness

540
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,760
training will help everyone in the

541
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,880
organization to be on the same page

542
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,960
and eventually this will reduce risk

543
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,160
into the incident

544
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,840
and help the entire workplace

545
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,919
now i'm going to the next phase which is

546
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,679
our test and release phase

547
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,440
so it's really important to perform

548
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,200
testing in the non-production

549
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,039
environment before going into the

550
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,640
development phase

551
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,280
here we want to test our web application

552
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:11,840
which it

553
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,080
should be yes that's really important

554
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,159
which should be a middle image of your

555
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,919
production environment

556
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,679
in this phase we will test web

557
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,919
applications apis

558
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,679
before they actually go into the

559
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,960
production

560
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,200
in this phase we're going to test about

561
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,120
many scenarios like session management

562
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,200
cross-site scripting

563
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,280
however in the last phase where we

564
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,360
perform the source code testing which is

565
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,520
independent of this testing this here

566
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,960
we're talking about web application and

567
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,840
api

568
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,679
the last time that you talk about the

569
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,159
hard coded password let's say

570
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,760
those are different than the issues

571
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,679
identified in this phase

572
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,440
because here we are dealing with the

573
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,520
real time application

574
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,039
and the last one we were dealing with

575
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,840
the scanning the static code

576
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,480
but it's really important to test both

577
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,000
and both are really individually

578
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,720
important

579
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,799
and we are supposed they're not supposed

580
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,760
to miss any of those

581
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,799
last is our deployment phase in this

582
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,640
phase your code is already in production

583
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,720
you have already done all the checklist

584
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,400
so what's next

585
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,200
very important your security is still

586
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,760
important

587
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,240
security does not stop because you have

588
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,960
reached deployment and implementation

589
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,600
because even after deployment and

590
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,720
implementation

591
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,000
security practices need to be followed

592
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,159
we need to be continuously test our

593
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,480
application for any new vulnerabilities

594
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,000
there are tons of zero-day

595
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,080
vulnerabilities so we need to make sure

596
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,400
that we are continuously testing those

597
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,320
it's a good practice to perform a

598
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,080
regular penetration test on the

599
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,120
production environment

600
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,320
so now what's next we talked about all

601
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,760
the phases

602
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,480
implementing security sdlc helps you

603
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,720
follow security best practices

604
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,280
integrating security activities and

605
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,520
checkup across development phase

606
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,360
this will help you increase the

607
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,760
basically the posture of your security

608
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,840
posture of your organization

609
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,760
but you have to create a security

610
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,120
culture you have to

611
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,120
work with the development team not

612
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,240
against them

613
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,559
you it's a collaborative effort you have

614
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,080
to make it fun you have to make it

615
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,840
education for them

616
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,760
so there are various ways to make it fun

617
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,520
you can have team competitions you can

618
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,880
have hackathon

619
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,200
there are fun ways to involve everyone

620
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,000
in your journey

621
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,240
of securing web application because it's

622
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,400
your own organization and it's your own

623
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,440
customer data and the

624
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,120
last thing that i'm going to talk about

625
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,720
measure the practices

626
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,360
have a dashboard track your high-risk

627
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,720
application

628
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,440
number of open security issues how much

629
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,039
time people are spending

630
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,120
in fixing those open issues are they

631
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,799
actually getting fixed or they are open

632
00:22:58,799 --> 00:22:59,760
from a long time

633
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,679
because if they are open for a long time

634
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,520
then you have to escalate it you have to

635
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,960
make somebody accountable

636
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,120
so have a dashboard and make sure it's

637
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,600
being regularly updated

638
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,080
and have list all the top 10 security

639
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,080
issues in your organization

640
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,280
and last measure plan and keep improving

641
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,480
with moving left in the sdlc that's all

642
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,159
i have for today

643
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,200
um now it's qna uh i will be in the

644
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,799
booth for q a section

645
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,919
and you can also tweet me uh my tutor
