1
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:17,920
hello everyone

2
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,039
good morning afternoon and good evening

3
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,240
uh the title of my talk uh would be uh

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,560
internal red team operations framework

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,679
building your practical internal rating

6
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,200
let's move on to the intro slide

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,840
my name is abhijit i'm also known by

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,760
this euro name abx

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,600
um right now i'm leading offensive

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,480
security operations or in a global

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,520
fintech company uh formerly uh the

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,840
deputy manager for cyber security as

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,399
at nissan motor corporation prior to

14
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,120
that uh

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,879
i was working with ebay as a serious

16
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,480
security analyst

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,480
so i have more than uh 10 years of

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,239
experience in the information and

19
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,199
uh security domain i'm also the founder

20
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,160
of

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,879
red team village community uh no uh it

22
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,799
is not associated with uh you know

23
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,640
dc i'm also acting as the lead organizer

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,119
at

25
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,000
defcon group terranton um i recently

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
started running a blog called

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,799
tactical advocacy.io which is uh

28
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,840
dedicated to

29
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,680
advaitial simulation and returning

30
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,280
tactics

31
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,640
moving on to the next slide so let's

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,759
make some things

33
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,920
very clear first i don't really want to

34
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,000
do an introduction about vulnerability

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,840
assessment fantastic or you know

36
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,720
security assessments but i just wanted

37
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,600
to make some statements uh very clear

38
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,600
before we go ahead so

39
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,000
uh a couple of things are there you know

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,680
this just needs to be uh

41
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,399
you know clarified number one

42
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,479
vulnerability assessment it is not

43
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,360
redeeming

44
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,040
so you all know that right what is

45
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,640
vulnerability assessment

46
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,640
so it's like you know if you are

47
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,840
targeting a system

48
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,240
application or a network so we will be

49
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,759
listing out all the possible

50
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,200
vulnerabilities in there

51
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,439
and you know the poc pocs for the

52
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,878
vulnerabilities how to remedy these

53
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,318
vulnerabilities everything would be

54
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:10,720
there

55
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,480
so that is what basically vulnerability

56
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,239
assessment is so again

57
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,840
vulnerability assumption it is not

58
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,520
redeeming

59
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,680
uh the next slide again fantastic it is

60
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,599
also not redeeming

61
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,360
uh i'll tell you something uh you know

62
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,440
uh pendleton on the other hand

63
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,480
it is more focused towards a goal you

64
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,920
know maybe we are targeting an

65
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,000
application or infrastructure

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,560
or only gold would be uh compromising

67
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,680
that system and

68
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,720
you know get access to that system so

69
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,400
the pendulum report also

70
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,640
reflect it should also reflect the same

71
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,680
rather than

72
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,800
listing all the vulnerabilities uh

73
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,599
because uh i'll tell you uh you know uh

74
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,959
the reason behind that

75
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,040
so we are facing a problem right now

76
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,480
nowadays they cannot

77
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,560
differentiate between uh vulnerability

78
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,640
assessment and pen testing reports

79
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,800
so usually uh vulnerability the

80
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,000
vulnerability assessment

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,280
report uh we are expecting uh it to be

82
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:07,760
uh

83
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,680
having uh you know all vulnerabilities

84
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,319
which may be exist in the target system

85
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,400
a punishing report it may list all the

86
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
vulnerabilities in the target system

87
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,040
instead of uh you know the exploitation

88
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,440
and how the attacker got into the system

89
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,200
like you know the actual attack path

90
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,280
would be there so that would be the

91
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,440
core difference between va and pendulum

92
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,400
report

93
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,040
so you know also i used to see external

94
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,120
pen testing reports or you know with ssl

95
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,480
issues only like you know

96
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,720
instead of listing down the attack path

97
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,879
and how they got access to the system

98
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,799
and nowadays uh the modern fantastic

99
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:41,920
report they are only

100
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,920
you know listing a couple of useless

101
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,519
vulnerabilities not

102
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,519
i'm not supposed to say useless but

103
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,200
something like uh low severity

104
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,080
vulnerabilities

105
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,280
instead of you know the actual

106
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,599
exploitation path

107
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,599
it is kind of confusing now you know we

108
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,720
cannot blame uh

109
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,680
anyone here uh you know by courting them

110
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,000
but

111
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,040
it is but it is what happening nowadays

112
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,920
i also uh want to uh point out once

113
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,720
again

114
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,040
pentesting is also not redeeming

115
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,920
next slide so we have a very cool

116
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,519
definition uh you know from the

117
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,519
redteams.net blog

118
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,000
it's like historically a team origins

119
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,440
from the military

120
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,919
teams uh which would imitate the role of

121
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:24,960
adversaries

122
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,560
or you know they will try to mimic

123
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,639
attacks against the military bases

124
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,440
or other targets so based on the outcome

125
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,120
like you know based on the

126
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,280
findings of which they had revealed you

127
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,040
know they would be

128
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,360
increasing the defense and security

129
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,120
messages at their base

130
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,680
so actually uh the the term red team it

131
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,199
came originally came from

132
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,080
military background

133
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,919
then we have you know another

134
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,160
explanation here this is also taken from

135
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,160
uh you know redteams.net

136
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,400
so in case of uh that's a that's a very

137
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,720
pretty very very uh you know very very

138
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,440
simple explanation error team is a group

139
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,520
of highly skilled people

140
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,080
that continuously challenge the plants

141
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,520
defensive measures

142
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,639
and security concepts that is that is

143
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,240
pretty simple

144
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,000
so in case of pen testing uh you know

145
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
there is a very different target and the

146
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,479
goal

147
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,520
it is more into god oriented for example

148
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,680
an application when it comes into

149
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,240
red teaming uh this is a very much full

150
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,800
scope

151
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,960
adversarial simulation so the

152
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,919
adversaries

153
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,160
uh they could target infrastructure

154
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,000
applications or surveys

155
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,720
even employees physical you know office

156
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,560
promises etc

157
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,240
so they will have they will be having a

158
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,680
set of objectives

159
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,800
very hardcore objectives which will be

160
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,600
focused on

161
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,160
actual address attack scenarios or you

162
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,280
know they'll be working on

163
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,919
they'll be working based on their goal

164
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:52,720
based on their

165
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,440
objectives but which is uh not similar

166
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,560
to fantastic

167
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,720
it's like you know like it mentioned

168
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,360
before this is like you know full scope

169
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,680
we are not uh limited to perform

170
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,600
assessment against an application or a

171
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,080
server

172
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,759
you know we are targeting the

173
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,680
organization you know

174
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,919
in every aspect of this you know its

175
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,000
business continuity or business or

176
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,360
range so this is also called uh address

177
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,520
rail simulation uh along with the

178
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,319
time red team you know basically both of

179
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,720
the same that is what i believe

180
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,919
moving on to the next slide

181
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,280
i think i have seen this picture right

182
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,319
you know

183
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,880
for example a security sales guy from uh

184
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,240
the security company called

185
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,280
xac is saying that our team will be

186
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:39,759
doing

187
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,520
pen test and vulnerability scanning for

188
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,440
the clients so usually

189
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,440
the security services or sales

190
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,560
executives

191
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,880
are there doing this you know i'm not

192
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,479
knocking anyone here

193
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,560
it is also very sad that many people are

194
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,960
seeing the teams of plantation justice

195
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,080
so by you know by using the time

196
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,840
internal team there are they are

197
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,080
actually meaning internal fantasy that

198
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,360
is not true

199
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,960
that is what i am you know trying to

200
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,800
establish here

201
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,360
to explain the actual job along with the

202
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,479
team professional

203
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,280
you know for example their title is like

204
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,759
a

205
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,560
relational or reductive operator so

206
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,680
along with that

207
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,360
memory many security folks are also

208
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,720
using the time uh

209
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,280
adversarial simulation specialist or

210
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,000
address

211
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,160
simulation uh you know professional uh

212
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,280
in their

213
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,360
you know linkedin or resumes so i have

214
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,039
recently seen a couple of

215
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,160
similar job titles in linkedin.com uh

216
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,639
you know uh which uh which is using uh

217
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,639
the title uh adversarial simulation

218
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,000
instead of red tv

219
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
or instead of uh reclaiming tactics or

220
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,680
something like that

221
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,120
moving on to the next slide

222
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,960
so i really wanted to or you know show

223
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,160
off this image

224
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,680
you know this is the perfect symphony

225
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,840
between attackers and the different days

226
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,599
you know the blue teams and uh

227
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,039
ratings so we created this picture

228
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,199
uh you know for there for a ctf

229
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,240
competition at a

230
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,160
conference called you know which is one

231
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,599
of the biggest cyber security conference

232
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,960
in india

233
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,400
so it was created based on the uh native

234
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,960
kerala martial art form color repeat

235
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,400
this is something similar to you know

236
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,759
other martial arts but

237
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,680
it is very old it is uh you know it is

238
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,360
traditional martial arts

239
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,440
uh in in our location which is scale

240
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,440
i think uh you know you like this

241
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,360
picture you know we are also uh

242
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,280
allowing uh this picture to be

243
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,879
downloaded as a wallpaper

244
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,039
maybe i can share you that link as well

245
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,919
okay uh let's uh you know coming back to

246
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,120
the actual topic here

247
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,559
let's go and build a an internal vetting

248
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,640
so most of the things mentioned here it

249
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,680
is from uh

250
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,160
my own experience and the awesome

251
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,640
contributors of the security community

252
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,360
so let's say most of the computer i mean

253
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,399
so i'm sorry

254
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,000
let's say most of the companies are

255
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,160
there already have their own access

256
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,959
and internal pentas team right so what

257
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:01,839
if they want to

258
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,920
uh move to a more matured attack

259
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,279
simulation activities

260
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,200
so they are already you know established

261
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
their active teams or internal

262
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,160
vulnerabilities

263
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,320
or painters teams so now it is the time

264
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,240
to you know move on to

265
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,800
a more matured uh you know offensive

266
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,959
team or more matured attack simulation

267
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:19,440
or

268
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,080
adversarial simulation team so i think

269
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,080
uh this talk would be helpful for such

270
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,399
people who are planning to

271
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,279
organize or implement such kind of

272
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,399
internal offensivity

273
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,560
uh you know he said very cute uh diagram

274
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,640
uh this is still a working progress

275
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,040
so we have created uh something called

276
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,880
internal team operations framework you

277
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,279
know which can be said as irtof

278
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,440
so we devised uh you know the the

279
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,640
functions or

280
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,680
or activities of internal offensive team

281
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,519
into uh you know five different phases

282
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,320
here

283
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
i think uh you know you guys seen this

284
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,080
maybe you guys have seen

285
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,760
the picture from superman movie or

286
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,279
something you know from the crowding

287
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,000
stage the

288
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,519
flying stage so uh we uh i mean we have

289
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,200
used uh you know uh

290
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,440
we took the idea from there and based on

291
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,440
that we have divided um

292
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,200
the actual operations into five

293
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,800
different steps

294
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,000
uh moving on to the next slide uh i mean

295
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,440
the very first slide of

296
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,880
iit of the face on

297
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,200
crawling so this is a very very basic

298
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,079
step of

299
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,839
irto and general team operations

300
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,920
framework or let's say building from the

301
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,440
scratch building the team from the

302
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,839
scratch

303
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,440
uh the very first thing would be uh get

304
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,120
the budget approval so if you are

305
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,560
planning to build the team

306
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,320
uh you know budget is always important

307
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,480
right so you need the budget to

308
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,640
get the tooling uh you know hire the

309
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,079
talent and all those things

310
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,560
uh you know you need uh internal budget

311
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,760
to be approved

312
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,720
so get the budget approach and defend

313
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,720
practical goals and objectives

314
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,040
the objectives must be crystal clear

315
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,040
because each organization has

316
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,440
different set of crown jewels you know

317
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,360
it may be their sensitive data or

318
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,760
their assets their formulas you know

319
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,839
their ips so

320
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,279
there is a difference between you know

321
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,880
each company

322
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,279
so it is uh you know secondly uh you

323
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,279
know rules of engagement that is also an

324
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,959
important thing you know based on the

325
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,800
organization and their

326
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,880
uh you know cultural or what culture

327
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,839
that may differ

328
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,800
that may differ it's like also you know

329
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,000
getting assistance from the

330
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,320
legal department and management that is

331
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,320
very very critical

332
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,079
uh then understand the secret the

333
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,320
current existing of you know security

334
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,160
post of your organization

335
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,000
uh because in order to have an entire

336
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,760
team you need to find out what are the

337
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,440
security messages or

338
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,440
uh you know different systems which is

339
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,959
already there in your company already

340
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,200
there in your organization

341
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,040
it is always or you know not about

342
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,639
owning the domain admin or

343
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,040
obtaining uh domain name conventions it

344
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,839
is always

345
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,000
about the critical assets or crown

346
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,959
jewels of

347
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,959
of an organization or you know of your

348
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,320
organization

349
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,639
so the critical assets needs to be uh

350
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,760
identified uh

351
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,000
critical people needs to be identified

352
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,600
they are more vulnerable to an attack

353
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,160
right

354
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,320
so every all these things comes under

355
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,480
understanding the security post of the

356
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,959
organization existing security posture

357
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,000
and finally

358
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,560
hire the talent aka the red team that's

359
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,000
uh that's one of the

360
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,880
biggest stepping face on hire the talent

361
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,160
because you need to

362
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,079
you need to have uh you know experienced

363
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,399
people so that you can you know

364
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,639
move on with the uh team implementation

365
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,320
right

366
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,839
next slide i think you have seen this uh

367
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,200
you know series of

368
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,920
the a team uh that is very very awesome

369
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,519
this is a very awesome series i

370
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,399
really like it so it's like the team and

371
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,240
skill set so this is the

372
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,959
most important part to build an internal

373
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,160
team

374
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,839
because of just imagine you have

375
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,360
everything you have touring you have

376
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,079
budget

377
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,920
you have like you know office very very

378
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,440
cool office premises

379
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,399
but uh you don't have uh the that i mean

380
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,600
you don't have

381
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,160
uh the very skilled people uh you know

382
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,800
and uh

383
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,800
in in writing tactics or address

384
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,000
assimilation so

385
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,160
that is not going to do well right so

386
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,920
this is very important this is the most

387
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,320
important part to build an internal team

388
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,720
so just look at 18 this is how a team

389
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,519
should be

390
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,760
the team must be diverse skilled in

391
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,000
different areas of attack simulation

392
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,959
or adversarial installation so they will

393
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,880
have to work together as a team or work

394
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,680
solo

395
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,760
and work under you know excessive amount

396
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,120
of pressure because you know

397
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,160
you know this is very much important to

398
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,639
uh you know have the ability to work

399
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,279
under

400
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,959
you know pressure nowadays that is very

401
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,399
important

402
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,720
as you know like uh carol hannibal you

403
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,399
know he is also a leader

404
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,279
and sometimes or he's also act as a solo

405
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,240
player

406
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,240
uh you know he get things done

407
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,839
single-handedly

408
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,120
the a team they are strong individually

409
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,839
and they are stronger as a team so

410
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,639
that's how a tune should team should be

411
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,720
so each team member covers his teammates

412
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,399
weakness and you know other

413
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,120
other issues and you know enhances them

414
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,920
the team should

415
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,320
also contain non-technical people that

416
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,600
is also critical

417
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,240
because just imagine you know a hardcore

418
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,760
technical guy is writing

419
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,320
a phishing campaign or phishing campaign

420
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,040
email

421
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,760
against a bunch of business executives

422
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,000
because of being technical people

423
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,160
being technical guys you know we always

424
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,760
have the tendency to use

425
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,760
more tech jargon right you know we'll be

426
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,040
using a lot of

427
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,839
you know techno ways in in our email so

428
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:36,399
uh

429
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,079
if you are targeting uh your business

430
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,720
executives or other other normal people

431
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,320
uh it won't work that way you know they

432
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,000
will find it very hard to you know

433
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,160
connect to that mate right so it is

434
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,519
always important to have

435
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,519
non-technical teams or non-technical

436
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,639
advices

437
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,279
within your team so that you know you

438
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,600
get an extra opinion from an outside guy

439
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:55,920
and

440
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,800
also you can use their skill set to you

441
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,240
know uh

442
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,120
a handful of things that is also

443
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,720
important

444
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,240
moving on to the next slide uh this is

445
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,560
the

446
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,040
phase two of iit or internal team

447
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,360
operation framework

448
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,320
uh it's like uh

449
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,399
so uh we need uh like you know a team

450
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,760
external infrastructure

451
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,560
uh that includes uh not only

452
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,920
infrastructure not only cloud

453
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,800
infrastructure

454
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,600
we also need uh you know domain names uh

455
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,360
you know uh email service of email

456
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,480
hosting services

457
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,959
so and so uh that is uh you know

458
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,880
external info is essential to mimic an

459
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,839
adversary's action so that is very much

460
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,360
important for the beginning uh you know

461
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:41,680
uh

462
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,839
just start with open source t2s open

463
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,079
source or command and control surveys

464
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,800
implants framework and other tools uh

465
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,040
mode we can modify these tooling uh you

466
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,079
know based on your requirement

467
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,199
and uh you know that's what is what it

468
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,199
says here you know corporate tools or

469
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,639
interface open source tooling

470
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,399
capabilities so you know you should be

471
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,279
able to

472
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,279
modify a couple of exiting open source

473
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,320
tools and you know

474
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,560
make it uh very useful for your current

475
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,880
your accessing scenario

476
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,199
next point would be uh always be friends

477
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,800
with your company's blue team

478
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,839
or company's cyber defense team it is it

479
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:18,800
is always

480
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,040
good to be in a good very good

481
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,480
relationship with your

482
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,279
companies or you know uh blue team or

483
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,120
security opportunity

484
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,120
uh because all of your adversarial

485
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,360
actions are you know they are

486
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,600
there to make the blue teams much

487
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,880
stronger than

488
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,759
stronger and enhanced you know whatever

489
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:38,399
you do

490
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,079
you know that you're not attacking your

491
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,240
own company right whatever vulnerability

492
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,880
or whatever

493
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,959
weakness or whatever misconfession you

494
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,440
find so that is there to

495
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,320
enhance the blue team's capabilities so

496
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,079
that is very much important

497
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,160
but once i try to be uh you know friends

498
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,920
with an organizations or you know blue

499
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,320
team

500
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,199
you know aka security operation center i

501
00:16:59,199 --> 00:16:59,519
think

502
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,240
uh you know i had gone too far you know

503
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,240
that is not supposed to happen

504
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,240
and uh you know she's my girlfriend now

505
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,160
oh it's that is very funny to you know

506
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,039
think

507
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,199
so just take it an easy way you know you

508
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,720
can be friends with your blue teams

509
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,119
organ

510
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,520
uh do your organization blue team but

511
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,280
you know just keep it on a limit

512
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,679
okay this is just a fair warning from my

513
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:20,959
end

514
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,919
the next point so start with additional

515
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,039
emulation using

516
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,199
you know so-called open source spine bar

517
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,960
we have atomic red team here

518
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,520
we can cadre here so it's like you know

519
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,039
metra is your friend

520
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,360
so they have all the resources in the

521
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,640
world you know

522
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,640
to help you with adversarial emulation

523
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,240
and apt emulation

524
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,120
so this would help you to understand the

525
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,039
detection capabilities of your

526
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,080
antivirus and edr products along with

527
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,559
your

528
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,559
stock implementation like you know log

529
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,919
cooling implementation

530
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,760
so how much of these activities are

531
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,440
being logged and been detected by your

532
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,360
blue team you know how many of these

533
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,720
attacks they're blocked by your

534
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,679
antivirus

535
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,440
how many of these attacks like you know

536
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,960
sensitive actions

537
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,240
uh was blocked by your edr software

538
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,919
so these kind of things can be

539
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,320
understand understandable from you know

540
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,640
uh i do emulation or apt emulation

541
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,320
or you can also validate you know

542
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,400
current difference mechanisms with a

543
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,200
bloating or by the by the help of meter

544
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,440
attack matrix

545
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,919
the next point start with simple and

546
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,919
pretty common fishing campaigns against

547
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,840
your employees you don't have to

548
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,720
um you know don't have to raise the uh

549
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,840
like quality here

550
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,559
just track just start something simple

551
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,919
may be easy to uh you know

552
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,840
organized from the from an employee's

553
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,039
perspective

554
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,039
so just just start simple and pretty

555
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,480
common fishing campaigns

556
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,559
uh you could just uh classify the ranks

557
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,240
of your employees based on you know

558
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,520
their levels right

559
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,679
and you can try various levels of

560
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,200
phishing campaigns against your

561
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,160
companies

562
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,039
uh like you know organ of like employees

563
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,960
so it will help you to understand uh the

564
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,640
response from your victims

565
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,240
so that we can validate your

566
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,000
organization has a male

567
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,760
or fishy size filtering of for example

568
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,559
a web proxy or you know to filter or new

569
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:12,880
or

570
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,760
unrecognized websites or there is a mail

571
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,840
filtering mechanism to filter

572
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,160
suspicious emails so you can validate

573
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,039
all these

574
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,960
uh you know security counter security

575
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,320
measures by

576
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,799
performing such kind of phishing

577
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,720
campaigns

578
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,200
you can also use these findings to

579
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,840
improve

580
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,679
the the existing defense mechanisms

581
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,320
just keep in mind that both systems and

582
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,559
the people or you know

583
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,039
it needs to be enhanced like you know

584
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,400
people awareness and

585
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
systems of enhancement that needs to be

586
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,160
done here

587
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,160
uh next one would be external attack

588
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,240
surface discovery and mapping so we know

589
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:52,880
that i think

590
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,640
most of the people you know they know

591
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,559
this part so it is very much

592
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,160
important to identify the internet

593
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,160
facing assets of your organization or

594
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,240
you know we should help the addresses to

595
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,039
gain a foothold into your network so you

596
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,240
see it is always

597
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,520
a good thing to map the attack surface

598
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,679
on the construction of an addressable

599
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,919
you know

600
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,320
then descending a remination process to

601
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,159
altas issues so that should be that that

602
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,600
must be there you know

603
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,840
all these findings and all these issues

604
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,440
or this there must be

605
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,760
a very very defined remediation process

606
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,280
to take care of all these issues

607
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,200
now the phase three so this is where you

608
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,480
know we begin to work

609
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,919
as per our irto plan so you can use

610
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,400
improved tools techniques and procedures

611
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,960
so uh we know about the current security

612
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,159
security mechanism

613
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,440
uh from the face on i2 so what if your

614
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,080
organization

615
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,240
is not allowing partial or any other

616
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,159
skills because you are trying something

617
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,720
internal like you're trying to uh you

618
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,440
know

619
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,039
run some tools on uh like you know

620
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,360
assuming uh using an assumption scenario

621
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,080
in a usage laptop or a server

622
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,919
so what if you know your uh your

623
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,120
organization is not

624
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,600
allowing partial or linear strips so you

625
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,320
can just

626
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,200
try the next best thing right we should

627
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,960
find the next feasible option

628
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,520
in this case we can try unmanaged

629
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,440
powershell you know it may be the

630
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,600
uh defense teams are not considering the

631
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,200
use of unmanned portion

632
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,320
so that is just the basic improvisation

633
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:26,640
of

634
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,120
existing tools and scenarios just to

635
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,159
make sure

636
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,480
what is the actual limiter of your uh

637
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,159
security products

638
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,400
for example it is blocking powershell

639
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,840
but if you are using unmanaged

640
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,559
powershell

641
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,480
we are able to execute powershell

642
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,120
commands right so that is not good right

643
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,679
so by doing this by you know doing step

644
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,840
by step modification and uh

645
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,080
step based upon you know testing we can

646
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,120
understand that

647
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,039
what is the actual capabilities of our

648
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,520
you know security implementation

649
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,919
so try to bypass your edr and antigua

650
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,679
software continuously you know it would

651
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,360
benefit the defense team and

652
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,440
systems very much so that is also

653
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,120
important

654
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,320
to be considered in phase three so

655
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,720
from phase one to phase three uh we had

656
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,039
identified the crown jewels and people

657
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,400
account jewels and

658
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,440
key people right so these i mean there

659
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,120
should be a wonderful path

660
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,039
you know which leads to the crown jewels

661
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,880
or the key people maybe there's a

662
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,159
pitching campaign

663
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,000
uh maybe uh you know that's some

664
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,919
weaknesses in the in your activity

665
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,440
infrastructure or maybe your cloud

666
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,480
implementation

667
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,200
so whatever it is the vulnerable path

668
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,600
towards these you know crown jewels

669
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,159
it needs to be fixed there is uh you

670
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,520
know that is uh

671
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,840
that's important so next thing

672
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,799
evaluation of

673
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,840
instant response process so this is also

674
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,200
important like you know what is the

675
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,039
organization's process once it's

676
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,000
been compromised how much time it did

677
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,640
take to

678
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,360
uh detect uh that instant and respond to

679
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,880
it you know the time

680
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,600
of the defense team uh you know uh taken

681
00:22:59,600 --> 00:22:59,919
to

682
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,640
uh contain the actual uh incident the

683
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,679
actual bridge

684
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,919
so that is very much important because

685
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:06,720
um

686
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,679
we we always have to ask you know assume

687
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,640
that

688
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,720
we had uh breached somehow you know

689
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,320
that's a very best

690
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,520
strategy out there uh because um

691
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,600
also that is the importance of instant

692
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,559
response process

693
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,360
because what if we got compromised or

694
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,720
what if we got breached

695
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,799
what is our data would bridge what is

696
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,080
our next plan

697
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,080
how do we deal with this so everything

698
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,760
comes under this insulin response

699
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,480
process

700
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,720
along with the roles and responsibility

701
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,159
so

702
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,880
one of the goal of the red team should

703
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,600
be

704
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
testing out the instant response

705
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,880
management uh you know

706
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,520
uh process okay and

707
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,440
also we can perform automata adversary

708
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,600
emulation and automatic campaigns or

709
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,279
such things can be done

710
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,760
and uh we can also perform automated

711
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,039
address re-emulation in

712
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,320
random surveys and machines on cinewile

713
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,520
just to assess our you know the security

714
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,000
teams

715
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,919
just the blue teams their detecting

716
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,760
capabilities

717
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,320
uh also using the output of previous

718
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,159
previous phases of phase one

719
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,600
two and now three we get improvised

720
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,080
and always make a new red team

721
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,200
operations pros

722
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,919
documentation because from phase online

723
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,200
to

724
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,039
we have learned a lot of things right

725
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,000
you know of the our company is accessing

726
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,559
um like you know security mechanisms

727
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,320
activity existing cyber defense or

728
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,520
security porsche

729
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,840
so based on that you know we also did a

730
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,679
couple of address re-emulation and uh

731
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,520
campaigns and all those stuff right

732
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,919
so based on that we have a in a very

733
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:42,960
good list of

734
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,880
items with our you know in our

735
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,520
repository so using that

736
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,600
we can create an improvised or you know

737
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,559
set of process documentation for our

738
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,520
internal team operations moving on to

739
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,400
the next slide

740
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,480
this is the face on uh irto start

741
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,480
running you know this is where we start

742
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,559
running uh in our

743
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,000
framework so the very first thing would

744
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,840
be collaborative and continuous puff

745
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,960
built-in exercise

746
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,720
i think you guys already know what is

747
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,000
purple team is right

748
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,840
so we need to have continuous and

749
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,760
collaborative exercises

750
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,720
joining hands with our bluetooth uh

751
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,679
because

752
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,080
like i mentioned in the previous slides

753
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,360
uh our

754
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,080
our our extreme goal is to uh you know

755
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,039
enhance

756
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,360
uh the cyber defense capabilities right

757
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,200
so it is very important to

758
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,360
organize uh collaborative and continuous

759
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,679
purple team exercises

760
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,919
and uh enterprise to of course

761
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,440
enterprise tooling capabilities

762
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,760
so bring in more doing capabilities you

763
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,440
know many interesting platforms and

764
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,559
tools are in the

765
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,960
or out there we should empower you know

766
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,919
the team and

767
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,000
both the teams and blue teams because

768
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,279
there are many

769
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,120
uh ready-made tools right if you are

770
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,200
buying if you are like occurring that

771
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,000
tools

772
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,840
and uh using it instead your

773
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,120
organization

774
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,440
you know the ready-made tools so you you

775
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,120
can verify like you know how much of

776
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,480
these tools can be

777
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,400
i mean the actions of these tools are

778
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,559
can be detected by the blue teams

779
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,080
because it's a ready-made tool right you

780
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,320
know it is supposed to get detected by

781
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,000
the blue teams and you know our cyber

782
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,600
defense softwares

783
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,760
so you can check that and you can also

784
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,640
use uh

785
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,039
the like you know the enterprise touring

786
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,320
capabilities to uh

787
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,279
extend your operations like you know on

788
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,520
a wide scale

789
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,520
and you know targeted uh campaigns

790
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,600
against the counters and key people

791
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,080
in the face in the previous phases uh we

792
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,159
did some uh you know pretty simple uh

793
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,799
campaigns against uh the usage just to

794
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,559
make sure that what is their response

795
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,159
you know are they falling to

796
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,760
these kind of very simple phishing

797
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,279
campaigns or you know

798
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,520
are they reporting to uh you know uh

799
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,400
like uh

800
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,960
spam uh or putting it as a spam or

801
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,760
reporting it

802
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,799
to defense team so uh that things has

803
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,080
been done there

804
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,360
but here we can go for pretty focused

805
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,120
and targeted campaigns

806
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,279
against the business executives

807
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,840
leadership or the management

808
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,919
so we can ensure like you know how what

809
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,520
is the percentage of the people or

810
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,480
percentage of

811
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,559
the management folks you know who are

812
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,159
vulnerable to fishing campaign or

813
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,279
vulnerable to

814
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,000
targeted uh you know or spearfishing

815
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,960
campaigns

816
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,799
so there are many many awesome

817
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,720
frameworks are out there i would also

818
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,520
always

819
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,600
prefer to use custom you know phishing

820
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,200
campaign instead of using a

821
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,039
framework because most of the frameworks

822
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,240
and their headaches

823
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,559
will be detected by uh like you know the

824
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,000
security measures and you know it will

825
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,720
get blocked

826
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,200
so always try to make something from the

827
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,320
from this crash

828
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,559
and try to uh you know do it in a manual

829
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,159
way so so that it will be more effective

830
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,279
so then odd physical security assessment

831
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,000
it is like you know uh overt is like you

832
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,360
are not breaking anything you know

833
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,880
you're just uh

834
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,200
observing things and trying to find

835
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,799
physical security weaknesses

836
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,640
it's like identify the most important

837
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,039
data centers manufacturing plans if you

838
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:05,279
are

839
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,919
you know like if you're into

840
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:08,960
manufacturing

841
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,960
uh processing center or anything based

842
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,159
on your company's business

843
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,880
business you know it may vary based on

844
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,640
data and these plans and you know

845
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,039
business and this so and so so you could

846
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,000
just go there

847
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,399
officially and you can work around the

848
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,320
premises or with the person in charge

849
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,200
maybe

850
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,520
uh maybe your supervisor or maybe your

851
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,640
teammates or

852
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,000
maybe the person in charge in that

853
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,640
facility so you can just uh more of i

854
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,760
mean roamer on

855
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,840
observe the physical systems and you

856
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,200
know maybe doors

857
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,320
locks rfid uh you know entry points uh

858
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,760
you know cctv cameras

859
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,399
such things so you can just roam around

860
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,000
and you can just perform your review in

861
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,440
front of or you know the person in

862
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,399
charge

863
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,159
that is called our physical security

864
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,520
assessment you are not

865
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,360
uh no it's like you know you don't get

866
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,200
to break any doors or load you don't get

867
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,679
to

868
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,760
clone our fairy clones or maybe you can

869
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,880
check for that

870
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,120
rfd you know cloning vulnerability or

871
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,559
you know some kind of things

872
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,000
or you don't get to break anything

873
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,679
because you are doing it in in

874
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,399
our manner right so just to do a review

875
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:09,600
to identify the vulnerabilities in

876
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,720
physical systems and

877
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,440
report it so that is what i mean by our

878
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,200
physical security assessments most of

879
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,000
the companies are doing it nowadays

880
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,080
so you can uh refer the work of

881
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,279
deviantart

882
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,600
in youtube like you know he's a best out

883
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,399
there

884
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,480
like in the inter in physical security

885
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,399
assessments oh there is a very his

886
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,520
youtube channel

887
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,200
uh that would be a very good reference

888
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,559
for you

889
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,559
so also continuous training process for

890
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,399
operators and defenders because

891
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,039
most of the organizations uh they have

892
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,000
their own internal

893
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,640
training programs and certifications uh

894
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,679
for their employees

895
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,000
especially uh the teams in offensive

896
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,880
security and

897
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,480
you know in the cyber defense teams

898
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,039
asset so you should also always have a

899
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,000
plan to

900
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,039
train your employees into the you know

901
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,640
i mean new certifications and new

902
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,240
training programs you should be there

903
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,320
also our proactive remediation process

904
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,919
and plan because in the previous

905
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,480
phases we did create a couple of

906
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,559
remediation plans right like you know

907
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,640
uh for example if the teams are coming

908
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,559
with a couple of findings a couple of

909
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:13,760
critical issues

910
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,919
that needs to be remediated within a

911
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,840
certain amount of time right

912
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,080
so in order to do that you should have a

913
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,600
proactive remediation

914
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,480
process and plan so by by the time we

915
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,840
reach phase four

916
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,600
uh because in the previous slide we

917
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,039
mentioned about creating a revelation

918
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,000
process right

919
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,880
so by the time we reach phase four so it

920
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,520
should be

921
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,960
more powerful like you know more

922
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,880
proactive compared to the previous

923
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,080
uh remediation process so there is an

924
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:40,720
operational

925
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,360
security tip uh regarding our security

926
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,120
physical security assessments

927
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,279
so do not uh if you are going to the you

928
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,480
know your office

929
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,960
i mean your companies are like you know

930
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,039
uh like uh officers or in other

931
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,000
locations

932
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,840
do not show up in a military air pulse

933
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,279
or a you know or with a tactical

934
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,320
backpack

935
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,279
or a laptop with full of stickers so i

936
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,799
do not uh you know

937
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,880
go into the client side or you know

938
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,320
wearing any of this

939
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
it places a lot of eyebrows even if

940
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,440
you're doing

941
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,679
uh an award physical security assignment

942
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:12,720
then just

943
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,039
imagine about or you know how that would

944
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,640
be if you're doing uh

945
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,200
i know what a covert or you know

946
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,120
physical security

947
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,200
so always just uh you know make sure to

948
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,440
trust accordingly

949
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,600
so i have to your phase five welcome to

950
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,720
the fifth phase

951
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,440
it is the time to go your angel wings

952
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,000
and fly

953
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,120
away so this is the step this is the

954
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,000
phase

955
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,399
uh where we would have matured the team

956
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:39,919
operations

957
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,320
so uh it's like by the time you should

958
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,120
have

959
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,279
by this time by the way you reach phase

960
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,240
five you should have or you must have

961
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,919
significant improvement in your

962
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,080
organizational organizations

963
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,120
security posture it's like both systems

964
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:55,519
and

965
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,399
people like you know um the improvement

966
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,159
of security i mean the security

967
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,880
improvement of you should cover the

968
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,000
people as well of

969
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,360
the systems uh in your organization

970
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,919
so skyler highly skilled operators you

971
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,399
know uh by the time you reach 55

972
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,360
uh you you should also have you should

973
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,480
also reach a

974
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,399
level where your operators are highly

975
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,320
skilled in different set of

976
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,240
additional simulation and uh you know

977
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,480
achieving activities

978
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,279
uh next point will defend purple team

979
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,679
model to measure the progress of

980
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,880
red team and blue team capabilities

981
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,240
so again this would help the management

982
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,760
to understand

983
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,679
the gaps which are there in the

984
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,559
organization's security portion

985
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,559
uh there is like what is the what are

986
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:45,840
the activities uh

987
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,559
done by the team what are the activities

988
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,000
of you know done by the

989
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,559
blue teams what are the new weaknesses

990
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:53,519
which was

991
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,919
uncovered by the teams and what is

992
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,679
actual coverage for the

993
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,000
blue team so uh there should be a very

994
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,960
matured

995
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,440
set of uh you know uh a panel like you

996
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,880
know let's say matics

997
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,360
to identify to measure the progress of

998
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,399
each team

999
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,880
and their campaign exercises so it

1000
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,600
should be there

1001
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,720
by the time we reach phase five next

1002
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,240
point

1003
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,320
uh covered physical security uh

1004
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,399
assessment so you can also start

1005
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,480
doing the covered security assessment by

1006
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,240
the time you reach face file

1007
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,360
so i have added the covert assessment in

1008
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,760
phase five only because a couple of

1009
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,360
reasons are there

1010
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,000
some uh organizations uh they have some

1011
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,440
difficulties to

1012
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,919
allow their employees uh to do covert

1013
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,039
assessments

1014
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,679
uh you know the team model needs to be

1015
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,200
in uh the trust and

1016
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,640
uh confidence of the management

1017
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,640
uh then you can move on to the covered

1018
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,320
security adjustment uh that would be a

1019
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,080
better approach it is not

1020
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,360
um you know recommended to uh like

1021
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,200
jump into covert or physical security

1022
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,960
assessment from face online page to

1023
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,919
onwards

1024
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,240
always just wait to uh you know gain the

1025
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,000
confidence and trust of your

1026
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,200
management um you know gain some uh

1027
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,119
skill in uh i mean put some skill into

1028
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,639
your team operations

1029
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,359
then move on to uh covered security

1030
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,280
throughout physical security estimate

1031
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,119
that is always an you know recommended

1032
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,560
model

1033
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,800
so custom tooling capabilities or custom

1034
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,639
tooling capabilities in the sense

1035
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,639
internally developed command and control

1036
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,159
uh you know platforms

1037
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,639
or custom implants very specific

1038
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,199
exploits to uh you know exploits

1039
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,159
and uh custom scripts to automate the

1040
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,159
operations within your organization

1041
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,560
so these capabilities must be there by

1042
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,599
the time

1043
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,040
you start to fly and

1044
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,520
continuous advisory simulation uh to

1045
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,639
keep

1046
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,839
the different days on their toes uh

1047
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,839
it's like uh you know just consider it

1048
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,359
as a a normal game

1049
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:56,159
it's a game a regular game uh which you

1050
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,000
you would play with your friends like

1051
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,040
you know you guys are

1052
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,200
detecting issues and uh the blue teams

1053
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,400
are

1054
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,040
enhancing the coverage and you're coming

1055
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,480
with coming up with something

1056
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,400
of some something new like you know some

1057
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,560
ways to maybe for example some ways to

1058
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,520
bypass the edr software some

1059
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,520
some techniques to some tools or

1060
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,560
techniques to

1061
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,560
uh bypass the monitoring capabilities of

1062
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,720
blue teams so just cancel us again you

1063
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,359
know

1064
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,440
there should be a continuous additional

1065
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,119
simulation and emulation

1066
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,680
uh to keep the different dates you know

1067
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,280
updated or you know that is very

1068
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,839
important

1069
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,240
and continuous rto

1070
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,480
uh you know with well defined process so

1071
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,000
because we are

1072
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,560
uh what what are we doing from phased on

1073
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,520
onwards

1074
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,240
we are creating we have created a rta

1075
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,079
process in phase one and phase two

1076
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,280
and by the time we reach these faces we

1077
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,400
are making it much

1078
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,320
better and better right you know we are

1079
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,480
just uh you know sharpening it

1080
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,079
our internal rtr process so just repeat

1081
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,040
the process

1082
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,440
make this process a cycle uh like you

1083
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,320
know continuous

1084
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,320
team operations with a well defined

1085
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,359
process

1086
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,599
uh just like i mentioned uh in just like

1087
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,119
i mentioned earlier

1088
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,880
this framework is still a working

1089
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,320
progress like you know

1090
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,320
there may be some things or which i am

1091
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,960
missing i will add more and more stuff

1092
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,280
you know here to uh make the framework

1093
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,359
look much better it's like uh

1094
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,359
i'm also trying to uh you know make some

1095
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,160
some kind of uh

1096
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,160
like you know model uh to make it uh

1097
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,160
very much use make it very much useful

1098
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,320
and uh usually for the both the teams

1099
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,680
and bluetooth you know so that

1100
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,800
they can build a team internally and

1101
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,480
monitor the progress

1102
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,079
so moving on to the next slide

1103
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,560
so this is also very very much important

1104
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,359
we have

1105
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,320
strategy plans and tactical plants so

1106
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,079
strategy plants are focusing on

1107
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,480
long-term objectives right so where the

1108
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,079
tactical plants focuses on

1109
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,760
short-term engagement short-term

1110
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,200
tactical engagement

1111
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,200
so you can derive a couple of tactical

1112
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,440
plants and chain them together

1113
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,880
to reach a strategical plan for example

1114
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,320
um in here our strategical plan is to

1115
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,359
have a matured red team operations

1116
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,640
within your organization right so we can

1117
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,720
you know to achieve that long-term

1118
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,040
objective or long-term goal

1119
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,880
you can devise a couple of tactical

1120
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,119
plans so in our case

1121
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,400
tactical plants are each phases so irtu

1122
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:32,720
has

1123
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,720
different faces right phase on to phase

1124
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,599
five so each faces can be considered as

1125
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,359
a tactical band

1126
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,480
so you know to reach you know a long

1127
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,520
long-term goal just take a tactical plan

1128
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,640
for example we are taking a phase on we

1129
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,560
can consider that as a tactical pan

1130
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,839
on so we are taking tactical pan one

1131
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,000
and we are giving it as time frame maybe

1132
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,240
let's say uh three to six months for

1133
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,680
example

1134
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,480
so within three to six months we will be

1135
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,119
covering

1136
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,560
all the items mentioned in tactical plan

1137
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,359
on which is irto face on we are calling

1138
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:10,079
right

1139
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,320
so all these uh items all these

1140
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,599
activities listed

1141
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,400
in there we can take them and we can

1142
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,160
complete them on a time frame

1143
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,920
start with you know start from three

1144
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,760
months to six months

1145
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,400
so after finishing that tactical plan we

1146
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,680
can move on to the

1147
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,839
next phase phase two which is statical

1148
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,040
point two

1149
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,280
so like that you know you can achieve

1150
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,040
your long-term objective you know based

1151
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,640
on your organization's

1152
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,880
uh current security porsche and

1153
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,640
constructing the business activities and

1154
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,680
other things

1155
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,160
you can always device your own plan like

1156
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,599
you know how much time

1157
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,400
uh it will it will which is needed to uh

1158
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,200
you know or

1159
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,760
have a fully mature team or internal

1160
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,720
team operations

1161
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,640
or fully matured internal offensive

1162
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,000
security operations

1163
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,920
so you can set that as a strategy plan

1164
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,160
like you know a long time objective

1165
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,400
and you can also use always use the face

1166
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,760
onto phase five

1167
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,160
these steps to create tactical fans and

1168
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,040
based on that

1169
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,200
you know we can move step by step right

1170
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,160
so that is the

1171
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,200
point of uh creating uh these uh

1172
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,119
five phases of internal rating

1173
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,359
operations

1174
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:20,079
and uh moving on to the next slide

1175
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,960
ah now this is the time for uh q one day

1176
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,880
