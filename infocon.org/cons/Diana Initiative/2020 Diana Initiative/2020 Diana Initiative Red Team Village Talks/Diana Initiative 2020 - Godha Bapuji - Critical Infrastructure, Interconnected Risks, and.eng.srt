00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,119
hello everyone

2
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,199
this is goda bapuji thank you red team

3
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,720
village and the dinah initiative for

4
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,160
inviting me here

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,760
today i'm going to talk about critical

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,920
infrastructure interconnected risks and

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,360
why we should care

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,360
as a woman in tech this is particularly

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,120
an important matter for me

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,879
and i'm going to share why this is so

11
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,800
so this is what we're going to do i'll

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,840
tell you a little bit about what

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,280
critical infrastructure is

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,399
what we mean by industry 4.0 and we'll

15
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,160
also try and understand some

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,760
general terms that we use in cyber

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,840
security and understand the interrelated

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,640
risks

19
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,800
and then we go on to look at some of the

20
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,280
more threats and vulnerabilities

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,440
but on top of that we're also going to

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,960
understand what cognitive and

23
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,119
sociocultural limitations are

24
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,080
and how and why we need to understand

25
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,240
this in order to build resilience

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,680
through preparedness and capacity

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,080
planning we'll look at some of the gaps

28
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,680
and some of the barriers

29
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,439
especially from a gender perspective and

30
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,880
this is why

31
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,400
um women should specifically be looking

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,400
at this presentation

33
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,600
thank you and let's begin so what is

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,240
critic

35
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,640
critical infrastructure critical

36
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,439
infrastructure

37
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,520
are those essential public services such

38
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,280
as hospitals banking

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,200
schools water treatment plans etc

40
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,159
and traditionally what has happened is

41
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:42,720
these

42
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,240
systems have existed for many years

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,360
but in the modern context these systems

44
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,479
are now connected

45
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,119
increasingly via the internet and we are

46
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,960
automating them so that we can

47
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,759
remotely administer them this is in

48
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,680
short what we call the industry 4.0

49
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,000
and here's a really good definition that

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,799
i really like

51
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,399
from the center for protection of

52
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,119
national infrastructure united kingdom

53
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,399
national infrastructure are those

54
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,560
facilities systems sites information

55
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,319
people networks and processes

56
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,879
necessary for a country to function and

57
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,319
upon which daily life

58
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,879
depends so pay attention to the keyword

59
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,200
daily life dependency

60
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,280
it also includes some functions sites

61
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,959
and organizations which are not critical

62
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,040
to the maintenance of essential services

63
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,519
but which need protection due to the

64
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,440
potential danger to public

65
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,280
example chemical sites

66
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,920
so here's a really good graphic and if

67
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,720
you guys see

68
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,000
um all of the links that i've used for

69
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,360
different graphics and different

70
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,599
references for this presentation

71
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,519
i have listed them at the bottom of the

72
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,800
slide so

73
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,440
you will be able to go to this website

74
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,239
and look at it in much more detail

75
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,440
so if you look at the history of our

76
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,959
industries on sort of a timeline

77
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,720
there was an original um inventions of

78
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,200
steam engines mechanization and water

79
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,239
power

80
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,400
and then when electricity was invented

81
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,400
we went on to we discovered

82
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
electric based industries and we went on

83
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,640
to mass production

84
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,879
in the after the war we discovered a lot

85
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,200
of

86
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,159
technology that revolved around internet

87
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,720
the internet was created which actually

88
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,040
created a whole different world in which

89
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,640
we could work in

90
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,680
and then when electronics took hold

91
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,319
we had the whole automation take on a

92
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,480
completely different meaning

93
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,920
now we come to what we call as the

94
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,840
fourth industrial revolution

95
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,080
what does that mean it's basically just

96
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,120
an extension

97
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,080
of everything we have until today

98
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,080
including the internet

99
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,480
but there's more automation and there's

100
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,560
more remote administration

101
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,959
and we also sometimes call it the cyber

102
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,040
physical systems because now the

103
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,799
traditional physical systems that have

104
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,560
existed across the three

105
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,439
uh past industrial revolutions are now

106
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,000
more

107
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,480
being brought onto the internet so this

108
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,159
graphic is a really good one

109
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,560
what is an industrial control system so

110
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,880
i i'm giving you a very simplistic

111
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,759
definition here

112
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,519
industrial control systems are a set of

113
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,360
components devices and systems that

114
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,320
together

115
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,479
control administer and manage the

116
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,639
critical infrastructure

117
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,840
and you will hear of this terminology

118
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,560
the ics folks may talk about this so you

119
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,240
hear of things like process control

120
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,400
system distributed control system

121
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,120
plc's programming uh programmable logic

122
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,199
controllers scada systems

123
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,680
um just remember that these are all

124
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,440
different systems that are

125
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,960
now additionally accessible remotely via

126
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,759
the internet

127
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,080
on the cyber realm

128
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,639
i've been asked this question a few

129
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,960
times um so i see a security is it not

130
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,800
the same as i.t security

131
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,360
and of course i've also heard a bit of

132
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,639
confusion between

133
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,759
i.t security and information security

134
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,720
but here's the thing ics security varies

135
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,199
from

136
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,840
i.t security because the attack vectors

137
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,520
and the impact surface bleed

138
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,400
into civilian lives if you remember the

139
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,039
first

140
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,520
slide our lives depend on the services

141
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,680
that we receive from hospitals banking

142
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,479
schools

143
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,080
and different infrastructure so we

144
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,000
depend on these services on a day-to-day

145
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,600
basis

146
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,000
which means if something happens to any

147
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,520
of these services

148
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,240
our lives directly get impacted so as

149
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,080
you can see this is completely

150
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,120
different from how a a cyber attack may

151
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,639
impact an i.t infrastructure

152
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,880
and ics basically works in two main

153
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,919
types of scenarios

154
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,840
now this is it goes to bit of

155
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,000
engineering uh terminology and

156
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,520
those of you folks who come from an

157
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,199
engineering background might

158
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,319
easily understand this the two main

159
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,319
scenarios are process-based industries

160
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,479
and discrete-based industries

161
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,800
now what's happening is electrical and

162
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,360
mechanical have converged

163
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,160
on the cyber realm which means

164
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,440
previously

165
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,919
um whatever was protected through

166
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,280
obscurity is now

167
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,120
exposed because of the internet and

168
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,639
because

169
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,160
the internet allows remote

170
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,479
administration we are able to

171
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,840
con control different aspects

172
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,600
at the physical state remotely

173
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,240
so just imagine a pivoted attack in a

174
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,560
process-based industry

175
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,000
the entire downward cycle gets impacted

176
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,080
whereas in a typical industry

177
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,160
process-based industry or discrete-based

178
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,199
industry

179
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,599
safety is a top priority then comes

180
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,000
reliability of the process

181
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,560
and then the information security cia

182
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,479
triad which is the confidentiality

183
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,039
integrity availability triad comes next

184
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,120
but we have to remember the golden rule

185
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,960
must not harm people

186
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,319
and that is key here for ics security

187
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,479
they care more about safety

188
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,479
so here's a little graphic that i

189
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,400
thought was really good and

190
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,160
summarized the difference between

191
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,720
process versus discrete based industry

192
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,919
so you can see here process

193
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,919
manufacturing industries food beverages

194
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,880
pharmaceuticals cosmetics chemicals

195
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,560
these are all examples of process-based

196
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,919
manufacturing whereas discrete

197
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,840
manufacturing as you can see here

198
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,000
they are parts based manufacturing so

199
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,440
examples are

200
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,639
in medical devices electrical electrical

201
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,280
equipment

202
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,840
automobile manufacturing and things like

203
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,080
that

204
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,520
so if you now look at the whole picture

205
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,840
at a very high level you understand that

206
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,639
what we call

207
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,120
cyber security cyber in the sense

208
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,319
network security

209
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,240
everything that we do on the internet

210
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,039
impacts every aspect of our life

211
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,360
so i put together a little graphic to

212
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,960
show us this interconnection

213
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,599
cyber security provides overall human

214
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,960
security

215
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,680
it ensures service availability it

216
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,520
assures integrity

217
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,639
and it impacts all of these services now

218
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,560
these are not exhaustively listed

219
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,319
on this graphic but you get the idea

220
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,080
based on the previous discussion that we

221
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,318
had

222
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,720
so why should we as civilians care well

223
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,199
i already told you that internet of

224
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:27,919
things

225
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,599
blurs a line between electrical and

226
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,280
mechanical

227
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,719
and what we thought was previously

228
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,000
secure because it was just a physical

229
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,080
safety aspect and not on the internet

230
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,080
you could simply lock the door

231
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,679
put a padlock on it and think it's

232
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,600
secure but now

233
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,360
that is exposed on the internet

234
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,080
so the security through obscurity no

235
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,160
longer seems valid

236
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,240
which also means that engineering

237
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,920
operational architecture and design

238
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,760
professionals can no more

239
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,680
say oh security does not impact us

240
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,680
cyber attacks don't impact us we cannot

241
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,279
say that anymore

242
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,320
which means also that when

243
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,839
operational folks when engineers design

244
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,440
infrastructures for cities and

245
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,279
industrial systems we

246
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,680
not only have to think about safety but

247
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,440
we have to think about security

248
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,279
and privacy as well because

249
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,279
our lives depend on these daily services

250
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,000
so what what are the risks of connecting

251
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,240
these devices to the internet

252
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,000
and there's that term that we used

253
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,680
internet of things

254
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,160
so you might be very familiar looking at

255
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,800
these

256
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,080
acronyms iot and iiot internet of things

257
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,880
and industrial internet of things now

258
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,240
here's a little question for you to

259
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,279
think about

260
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,440
do we really need our personal coffee

261
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,360
maker our toaster our refrigerator our

262
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,959
smart tv on the internet

263
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,680
think about it is it necessary i don't

264
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,160
think it is

265
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,000
so we need to understand the risks

266
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,240
before we do something before we put our

267
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,640
enable the smartness on our tv we need

268
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,240
to think is it really necessary

269
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,680
do you really need to check your egg

270
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,160
levels from your iphone

271
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,920
in the refrigerator so let's

272
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,440
look at the risks threats

273
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,160
vulnerabilities and some of those things

274
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,360
now here's a really good picture that i

275
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,800
like sharing and this is from the world

276
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,360
economic firm's global risk report

277
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,800
you can see the link at the bottom this

278
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,360
is from the 2020 report

279
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,040
this is a great visual to help you see

280
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,079
what i mean by interconnected risks

281
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,240
typically when you think of risk you

282
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,200
know we might think

283
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,200
okay if i do this something happens

284
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,040
but then in an interconnected risk you

285
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,040
have to think if i do this

286
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,200
what are the different things that might

287
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,560
happen or

288
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,640
if something happens somewhere how is it

289
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,600
going to impact

290
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,279
me and that is the meaning of

291
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,640
interconnected risks

292
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,600
so as you can see this is not linear it

293
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,480
is almost like a node in a graph

294
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,120
so there are multi-point variables from

295
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,680
where

296
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,680
you could be impacted because something

297
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,279
is happening which is causing something

298
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,680
else

299
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,839
somewhere and you could be impacted

300
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,040
because of that

301
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,720
that's how we need to think in our

302
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,800
margin context and that's why i really

303
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,599
like this picture

304
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,880
there's another important thing defense

305
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,200
and military organizations like nato

306
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,600
have formally recognized cyberspace as a

307
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,360
new frontier in defense

308
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,040
along with land arc which means

309
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,760
the cyber realm could be used to wage

310
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,320
cyber warfare

311
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,720
on the computer networks what does it

312
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,600
mean

313
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,200
it means that the alliance could use

314
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,880
cyber weapons to manage global threats

315
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,720
to systems and infrastructure used by

316
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,240
nato allies

317
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,120
remember this keyword allies north

318
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,000
america and european

319
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,120
countries what about other countries are

320
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,360
they prepared

321
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,519
in short is the civilian world ready for

322
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,519
the impact from new generation warfare

323
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,120
that's the key question we need to ask

324
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,519
ourselves

325
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,720
let's look at this now it's an

326
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,399
interesting map and it's from

327
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,040
imperva.com

328
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,200
and just not to

329
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,519
sort of take it out of context but

330
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,360
actually to bring it into context if you

331
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,800
look at this map today you might think

332
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,240
maybe these are coveted infections

333
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,920
covid19 infections

334
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,560
but actually not this is from 2016 when

335
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,079
the mirai botnet

336
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,440
infected computers all over the world

337
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,600
and surprisingly it was a very simple

338
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,519
attack a distributed denial of service

339
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,160
attack

340
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,680
and it targeted cctv's cameras

341
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,600
dvrs routers so you see what i mean

342
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,160
of how pervasive internet attacks can

343
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,839
get and control our lives

344
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,920
the international federation of red

345
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,240
cross actually helps us

346
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,160
divide disasters into five

347
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,920
big types so you've got the geophysical

348
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,920
disasters you've got biological

349
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,480
you've got climate disaster and you've

350
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,240
got weather related disasters

351
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,800
and you've got hydrological disasters

352
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,000
but think about this

353
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,680
on top of the existing disasters that we

354
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,000
already know that are quite complex as

355
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,959
it is

356
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,120
earthquakes fires tsunamis

357
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,800
on top of these things think about the

358
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,880
social inequities that exist in our

359
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,959
societies

360
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,639
and then think about the irreversible

361
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,200
damage we're doing to our ecosystems

362
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,800
to our biodiversity and think about the

363
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,480
unsustained unhindered

364
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,480
development policies that put profits

365
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,920
over people

366
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,279
these are all the counteracting forces

367
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,600
on top of that think about inequitable

368
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,720
technological

369
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,079
developments which means if you don't

370
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,440
really pay attention

371
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,320
to the stuff that we're putting online

372
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,079
to the type of code we are writing

373
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,000
to the security and safety of our

374
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,839
systems

375
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,160
when something happens now think about

376
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,920
the interrelated risks

377
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,040
picture that i showed you the innermost

378
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,000
circle that you see

379
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,279
a geophysical disaster like an

380
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,720
earthquake

381
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,160
might impact internet systems

382
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,240
which means people who are already in

383
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,800
poverty may not be able to access

384
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,360
services that are provided online

385
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,399
kovid19

386
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,560
has actually shown us how life can be

387
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,519
during a global pandemic something that

388
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,519
affects everybody across the world

389
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,320
the entire world was shut down but we

390
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,279
all got along

391
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,160
we all kept together one reason we had

392
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,920
the internet with us

393
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,600
but just imagine if the internet were to

394
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,199
be impacted

395
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,600
the internet cannot become our single

396
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,360
point of failure and this is why it's

397
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,040
important for us to pay attention to

398
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,839
this fact

399
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,199
so what are the types of vulnerabilities

400
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,800
that the internet faces and why is this

401
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,880
important

402
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,279
more than you can believe the internet

403
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,959
actually allows us

404
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,160
to conduct several types of attacks

405
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,560
sometimes human become the weakest links

406
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,880
because what happens usually is we pay a

407
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,399
lot of attention

408
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,000
to you know installing

409
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,920
um ssl certificates to doing a giving a

410
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,959
great ux ui on our systems but some of

411
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,120
the core services

412
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,759
that start at the physical level or some

413
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,040
of the core services that

414
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,000
are at the database level we typically

415
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,199
tend to ignore them

416
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,720
or forget them or think that oh

417
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,639
this is on the innermost network nobody

418
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,639
is able to access it

419
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,920
that's the typical excuse that we hear

420
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,519
but then just imagine

421
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,680
with more and more interconnected

422
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,720
systems

423
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,360
it is harder for us to find out where

424
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,639
the attack is coming from

425
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,399
which means we are not sure of the

426
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,399
vectors of the attack

427
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,360
it could be from anywhere and this

428
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,800
graphic is really neat because this

429
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,040
gives us sort of a

430
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,360
high level overview of the different

431
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,880
types of attacks that could

432
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,839
happen in an industrial system

433
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,800
on top of that as you may already know

434
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,120
mobile phones have their own problems

435
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,959
they are not completely secure

436
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,320
well you might say yeah i'm going to

437
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,079
turn off my locations

438
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,800
setting in in the settings but turning

439
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,560
off location settings does not

440
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,279
completely resolve the issue the device

441
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,079
itself

442
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,560
has location tracking abilities and

443
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,680
there are

444
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,920
several issues within the device

445
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,440
software itself

446
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,680
so mobile phones have their own set of

447
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,399
problems that complicate issues further

448
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,720
so just think if you're using the mobile

449
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,120
phone to remotely administer

450
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,199
your systems your critical systems

451
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,480
that's not a very good idea

452
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,439
over that you've got networking

453
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,720
protocols that have their own

454
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,640
limitations a lot of these protocols

455
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,679
have been

456
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,280
are legacy protocols they have been

457
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,720
written many years ago

458
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,000
are they forward compatible we

459
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,240
try to patch them every now and then

460
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,400
right we try to do our maintenance on

461
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,280
our systems

462
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,080
yes but inherently a lot of these

463
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,039
protocols

464
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,400
have limitations within themselves and

465
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,039
you may have heard a lot about the

466
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,559
issues around the 5g

467
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,520
network but do your research don't

468
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,120
believe what the media tells you don't

469
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,000
believe what you

470
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,559
see on the internet i suggest you do

471
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,919
your own research

472
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,400
read scientific journals read

473
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,080
engineering journals

474
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,679
make sure they come from reputable

475
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,880
sources look at the number of citations

476
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,440
for each of these articles and then you

477
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,720
understand

478
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,880
the type of issues that your networking

479
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,840
protocols

480
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,520
have software maintenance brings

481
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,120
additional complexity in highly

482
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,799
interconnected systems

483
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,120
especially now if you couple them with

484
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,799
your critical systems

485
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,200
and that's why it's important for us to

486
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,000
critically

487
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,840
think if and how we should connect our

488
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,760
industrial systems to the network

489
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,520
and not just our industrial systems but

490
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,600
also our daily

491
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,280
life stuff that we say

492
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,600
as in internet of things within our

493
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,400
homes

494
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,799
onto the network because here's a

495
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,320
thought

496
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,480
although we might say oh i don't have

497
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,559
any important data on me

498
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,120
there's nothing expensive that i hold or

499
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,760
there's nothing confidential that i hold

500
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,919
but what usually happens is if you don't

501
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,520
pay attention to the security of your

502
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,080
devices

503
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,080
at your home or in your small business

504
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,280
your system could be used

505
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,880
as one of the routes through which

506
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,440
other attacks could be launched so you

507
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,960
have to really pay attention to even

508
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,120
your security

509
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,000
and here's the fact as humans we have

510
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
cognitive limitations

511
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,760
which means you also have to remember

512
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,760
that artificial intelligence code can

513
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,520
also have these bias and limitations

514
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,280
built in as a result

515
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,760
because the way we think the way we make

516
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,880
decisions

517
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,039
those decisions will be reflected in the

518
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,600
way we program and write these aii code

519
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,039
and the way we train

520
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,080
ml to recognize

521
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,440
the the learning patterns so it's very

522
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,520
important to recognize that we have

523
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,400
cognitive

524
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,280
limitations that will impact security

525
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,440
and safety

526
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,440
and here's a nice uh matrix on a grid

527
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,520
this comes from a the very famous book

528
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,440
thinking fast and slow by kahneman and

529
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,640
sversky

530
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,640
and it's called a four-fold pattern of

531
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,280
preferences what it basically tells you

532
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,840
is that as humans we have

533
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,280
fallacies which means depending on

534
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,480
whether we are winning

535
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,360
or losing

536
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,760
how much risk we are willing to take

537
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,799
changes

538
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,960
and this matrix is a very good way to

539
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,799
look at it

540
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,360
and we also work under many limitations

541
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,600
for example you've got

542
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,880
laws that give you the overarching rules

543
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,400
of how you have to

544
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,280
work within your environment you've got

545
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,240
regulations

546
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,840
and then you've got contractual

547
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,280
obligations

548
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,720
but on top of that you've got

549
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,200
geopolitics and you've got your social

550
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,559
cultural norms that

551
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,760
tell you whether or not you should be

552
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,520
doing something how much integrity do

553
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,400
you have whether

554
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,400
the community you know whether you carry

555
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,919
out your business operations with

556
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:50,720
integrity

557
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,919
there are so many aspects that impact

558
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,400
how we think about security and safety

559
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,679
and how we make

560
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,320
decisions about risk so when you want to

561
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,919
know how you make decisions about risk

562
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:02,720
think about the

563
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,120
matrix that i showed you we tend to make

564
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,799
decisions based on

565
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,600
whether we are winning or losing and our

566
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,799
risk attitude changes

567
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,600
according to that

568
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,840
so what's the best way to get out of all

569
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,000
of this the best way is to be prepared

570
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,520
we need to prepare really well we need

571
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,520
to understand what we are preparing for

572
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,960
and that's why capacity planning

573
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,760
one of the um biggest deficiencies that

574
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,320
i know

575
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,200
i've noticed over the past you know over

576
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,400
two decades that have been in the

577
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,039
industry is that

578
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,799
most of the companies most of the

579
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,640
organizations many of us

580
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,240
don't really have a tab on what our

581
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,280
assets are what are critical assets are

582
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,640
be it information b

583
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,760
devices so asset management is really

584
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,039
poor even today and what do we mean by

585
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,720
asset management

586
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,640
if you really don't know what your

587
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,400
empire looks like

588
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,640
or what your organization looks like

589
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,880
what are the key

590
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,200
assets that you need to protect what is

591
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,960
important to you

592
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,799
if we don't have that classification

593
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,039
categorization and prioritization

594
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,200
it is very hard to protect because you

595
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,320
cannot literally

596
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,880
protect put a bubble around everything

597
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,960
so that's why asset recognition is very

598
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,960
important we need to characterize it

599
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,760
based on priority that way it becomes

600
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,960
easier for us to

601
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,640
segregate our assets give them priority

602
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,280
in terms of security and confidentiality

603
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,799
and whether or not they have to be

604
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,120
available 24 7

605
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,360
and depending on these decisions we can

606
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,240
then provide

607
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,960
the relevant safety and security for

608
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,679
these assets

609
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,039
now that you have a very high level a

610
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,039
very quick overview of what

611
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,720
critical infrastructure is what do we

612
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,360
mean by ics and how does cyber security

613
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,799
relate to all of these things

614
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,480
you might be wondering so what can i do

615
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,440
to help protect our ics

616
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,600
of course as i say here you must join in

617
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,360
the workforce for the future

618
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,280
skills required to defend our ics now

619
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,120
here are some of the skills that i

620
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,919
recommend learning the first i would

621
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,280
start with understanding network

622
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,960
protocols and how they might differ in

623
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,320
industrial systems

624
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,640
so take time to actually study network

625
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,440
protocols

626
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,600
take time to study operating systems how

627
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,280
the kernel and the core of the operating

628
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,240
systems work

629
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,919
because most of the security

630
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,880
vulnerabilities exist within this core

631
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,720
so it's very important for us to

632
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,960
understand how legacy systems work how

633
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,080
new systems work

634
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,440
and what are the middle

635
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,440
layer applications that connect these

636
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,720
two

637
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,320
we really need to understand that so you

638
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,000
could start with that

639
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,679
on top of that you could understand what

640
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,760
policy and safety regulations mean in

641
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,520
industrial zones they look very

642
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,520
different compared to the safety

643
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,440
the security policies that you might see

644
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,559
in an i.t

645
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,960
sector so it's very important for us to

646
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,799
understand

647
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,480
what these safety regulations are

648
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,240
and you also have to remember that every

649
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,520
country has a

650
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,320
different set almost similar but there

651
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,320
could be some differences in the way

652
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,159
a country recognizes their critical

653
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,600
infrastructure for

654
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,520
in some countries for example there are

655
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,640
about uh in

656
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,600
in the us we have about 16 sectors that

657
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,400
we classify

658
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,919
under critical infrastructure

659
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,360
in uk i think we have 13.

660
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,400
so you have to understand the definition

661
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,480
of critical infrastructure wiles remains

662
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,679
the same

663
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,840
what is designated as a critical

664
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,520
infrastructure may vary between

665
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,640
countries

666
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,880
so it would be a nice step forward to

667
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,919
understand

668
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,640
apart from the policies and regulations

669
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,080
in industrial zones

670
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,000
what are critical sectors in each of

671
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,679
these countries that you're working with

672
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,279
so it would be nice to understand learn

673
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,400
that

674
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,960
and some of the basic things it's good

675
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,960
to understand how electrical electronic

676
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,720
and mechanical devices work together in

677
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,559
industrial systems

678
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,279
so it might be really nice perhaps if

679
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,960
you're considering taking a degree now

680
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,480
you're at that stage then maybe you

681
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,080
should consider an engineering degree

682
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,919
you could study engineering so

683
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,039
you know the question how does

684
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,640
engineering relate to cyber security

685
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,120
will i become a hacker

686
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,720
yes that's not the question to think

687
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,159
about now that is a very

688
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,400
single focused question you have to

689
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,640
think about interconnected risks

690
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,400
you have to think about all these things

691
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,000
that i have shared in the past few

692
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,559
minutes

693
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,799
to say why should i be looking at these

694
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,799
things and how does it relate with cyber

695
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,440
security

696
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,520
the next one understanding risks

697
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,039
vulnerabilities threats and

698
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,039
impact on communities due to an

699
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,880
industrial system failure

700
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,400
now i've told you about the different

701
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,360
aspects of why industrial security and

702
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,120
critical systems are important to us as

703
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,960
civilians

704
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,880
which means we have to understand the

705
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,799
interconnected risks that these systems

706
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,440
bring if they are on the internet and

707
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,000
available

708
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,039
via remote administration if something

709
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,840
fails in the systems how does it impact

710
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,360
our daily life

711
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,240
so one example is a water treatment plan

712
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,080
what happens if a water treatment plant

713
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,760
the actuator goes shuts off

714
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,320
maybe the sewage system doesn't work our

715
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,400
water systems get polluted

716
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,840
just imagine what might come out of your

717
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,559
tap is it safe enough to drink

718
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,000
so you have to think about

719
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,559
interconnections at that level

720
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,799
start from the industry think about your

721
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,640
own life and think about how these two

722
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,000
things are connected now

723
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,120
we cannot only think about information

724
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,400
in the modern context we have to think

725
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,440
about physical safety and security

726
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,440
therefore we have to understand what are

727
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,799
the defenses

728
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,960
what do we mean by business continuity

729
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,320
and what do we actually mean by

730
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,879
resilience

731
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,200
for each of these systems which means

732
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,039
when something happens

733
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,840
do we have a backup plan if the internet

734
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,520
were to go down in a certain part of the

735
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,320
region

736
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,279
do we have backup of working without the

737
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,720
internet

738
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,000
it almost seems pervasive how

739
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,520
we tend to google everything can you do

740
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,159
that

741
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,799
can you think of options and solutions

742
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,080
without googling

743
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,679
do you have access to telephone

744
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,279
directories and information at your

745
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,080
fingertips

746
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,080
written down somewhere do you have a

747
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,840
physical backup of things

748
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,120
these are the type of things that you

749
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,640
have to think about in order to become

750
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,520
resilient

751
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,520
in the modern context and that's why

752
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,600
this matters

753
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
beyond all these things you also have to

754
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,679
understand the cultures and geopolitics

755
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,440
of the world what's going on in the

756
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,080
world

757
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,799
is very important because what happens

758
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:39,919
elsewhere

759
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,679
will now impact our lives directly

760
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,799
be it a health pandemic or be it a cyber

761
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,399
security issue

762
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,159
we really have to pay attention to what

763
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,600
is going on in the world

764
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,200
which means we have to understand the

765
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,440
politics that's going on in the world

766
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,960
and how those politics can play into

767
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,840
the services that we have and perhaps

768
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,240
how

769
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,240
the services could be used as a tool

770
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,600
to conduct cyber warfare

771
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,120
now this is not an endorsement of aws

772
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,240
but i just thought

773
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,679
um because i really like um these are

774
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:20,720
these services

775
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,880
and um they're one of my favorites i

776
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,640
thought i should share this with you

777
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,279
so pick up your favorite cloud service

778
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,960
any from any vendor

779
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,880
and look at what type of cloud services

780
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,480
they offer what type of

781
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,919
specifically with respect to iot and

782
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,679
ics look at what software they

783
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,320
offer look at what kind of equipment and

784
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,000
devices they offer

785
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,480
and maybe go ahead and learn the skills

786
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,919
because these are the type of skills

787
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,960
we'll need for future

788
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,919
and you could learn about thread

789
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,840
modeling that's a nice

790
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,480
start as well to understand what exactly

791
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,440
happens

792
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,679
in the mind of an attacker and how do

793
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,080
you go about resolving that or counter

794
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,360
attacking that or defending that so

795
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,600
this slide gives you some sort of a

796
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,240
start to that with a few links here

797
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,640
some of my favorite links but also if

798
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,520
you look at this

799
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,159
uh little graphic on the right hand side

800
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,919
you see that the adversary group

801
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,080
uses techniques and this is by mitre

802
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,640
the techniques accomplish certain

803
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,880
tactics

804
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,279
and the adversity group also uses

805
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,640
software

806
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,360
and social engineering to achieve what

807
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,279
they want to achieve

808
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,320
in terms of a cyber attack

809
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,559
so this is a really nice graphic and i

810
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:43,520
highly recommend

811
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,679
um going through the mitre attack and

812
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,520
the cyber kill chain

813
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,880
to understand how exactly an attacker

814
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,520
thinks

815
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,520
so that you can defend in the same way

816
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,919
by following the tracks now i mentioned

817
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,600
about geopolitics so this is another

818
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,880
area where i would highly recommend

819
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,760
you looking into is international

820
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,799
relations and international security

821
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,720
take these courses take get a degree

822
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,240
maybe and study how

823
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,279
nations perceive cybersecurity it's a

824
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,080
very different

825
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,679
lens you'll get by studying

826
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,200
international relations and world

827
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,880
politics and security

828
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,919
at a global level to understand how

829
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,600
countries think about

830
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,919
cyber security what kind of systems do

831
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,360
they have in place

832
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,760
so you're taking a very high level view

833
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,120
at security

834
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,880
and it helps you understand the

835
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,880
interconnections when you zoom out and

836
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,000
look at things from a higher level

837
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,679
and then you also understand what type

838
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,440
of international laws apply to the field

839
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:43,840
of

840
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,480
cyber security so here i recommend a

841
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,000
good place to start would be the nato

842
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,799
website

843
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,760
they have wonderful resources for you to

844
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,720
go look at

845
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,480
and and study if you like the talent 2.0

846
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,399
manual is also a great start is one of

847
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,919
my favorite places to

848
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,640
understand cyber laws it is available

849
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,240
online so you could look at

850
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,240
the online resource and look at all the

851
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,840
different laws that they have created it

852
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,399
is not

853
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,159
a a binding law but it is sort of

854
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,120
put together as a guidance for the cyber

855
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,600
security community

856
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,760
and here's a learning map that i offer

857
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,880
so you could

858
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,559
say you know understand the key terms

859
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,159
and this is basically the learning map

860
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,120
that i have

861
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,080
designed the slide deck as well so make

862
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,960
sure you

863
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,640
use this as sort of help to my help you

864
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,279
go from

865
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,679
point to point in navigating the cyber

866
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,000
security field

867
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,760
and now the next thing is to understand

868
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,000
gaps why and how all these matter

869
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,039
and what are the issues we face today

870
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,880
so we've already talked about this

871
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,159
digital technologies

872
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,919
increasingly feature in what we call the

873
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,519
asymmetric warfare

874
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,760
what is asymmetric warfare they are

875
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,840
attacks by smaller countries

876
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,240
and less powerful countries and

877
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,519
non-state actors on

878
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,200
larger powerful states

879
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,919
so you can look at more at this in in

880
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,600
the global risks report

881
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,080
from the world economic forum very

882
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,000
important point to remember is war zones

883
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,480
are now

884
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,240
no longer limited to a distinct

885
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,919
geographic area

886
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,080
because of how industrial systems are

887
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,600
now connected on cyber

888
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,720
realm cyber warfare can

889
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,600
actually impact our physical lives and

890
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,440
that's why i say war zones are no longer

891
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,200
limited to a geographic area

892
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,679
now here's the state and this is why

893
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,840
it's important for us to pay attention

894
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,080
to the cyber security workforce this is

895
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,360
a report from 2019 from ise squared

896
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,360
and the report clearly shows us that

897
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,120
there aren't enough people to monitor

898
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:47,840
prevent

899
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,039
and deter cyberspace

900
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,200
and this is a picture that you can see

901
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,279
by region by different regions of

902
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,760
the workforce gap in each of these

903
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,240
regions

904
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,159
and here's a very interesting statistic

905
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,080
that i thought i must share

906
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,200
as a piece of data that is relevant now

907
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:11,519
this

908
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,039
there is a global cyber security index

909
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,120
and they rank countries based on several

910
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,200
factors you can see what those factors

911
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,880
are in the methodology of the report

912
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,519
i've

913
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,200
put in the link at the bottom of the

914
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,159
slide but according to the 2018

915
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,399
report india regionally in the

916
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,200
asia pacific region stands ranks 10

917
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,240
number 10

918
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,080
and globally it ranks 47 on global cyber

919
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,279
security index

920
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,159
ranking which means this tells us there

921
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:43,919
is a lot of work to do

922
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,200
for us to prepare to become much more

923
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,960
proactive and resilient as a country

924
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,840
to secure the resources and our people

925
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,960
and here's another graphic that has a

926
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,240
piece of data

927
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,640
i like giving you these uh pieces of

928
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,399
data because it makes more sense when

929
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,399
you look at facts

930
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,280
what this slide tells you is that the

931
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,320
potential

932
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,599
that females give us in terms of labor

933
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,359
force is much higher

934
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,239
compared to the potential label force of

935
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:18,879
men

936
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,599
and this is quite consistent across the

937
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:22,560
different

938
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,480
income groups as you can see here and

939
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,000
i've marked it

940
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,760
with the red blocks here

941
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,760
so this effectively means that we must

942
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,239
match potential to workforce gaps so

943
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,320
you saw the previous slide where i said

944
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,359
that we don't have

945
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,280
enough cyber security professionals in

946
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,480
our workforce

947
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,520
to protect and defend our countries

948
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,359
and here in this slide you're seeing

949
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,719
that there are

950
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,760
women available who are ready

951
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,440
to contribute to the workforce but we

952
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,440
are not utilizing their services and

953
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,079
skills

954
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,040
in the right way there is a gap between

955
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,760
the supply

956
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,800
and the demand so we must close this gap

957
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,200
so why aren't we able to close these

958
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,640
gaps because

959
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,000
there are barriers what are those

960
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,720
barriers

961
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,160
now i haven't tried to be very

962
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,920
exhaustive in listing out the barriers

963
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,320
but here are some of my favorites

964
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,359
women in stem now although

965
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,480
we think by if you if you try to google

966
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,839
data on

967
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,640
women in science and technology fields

968
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,320
we might be under an impression

969
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,200
that let's say a country like india has

970
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,000
many women

971
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,920
in engineering streams but that does not

972
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,480
actually translate to quality outcomes

973
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,320
in terms of workforce

974
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,960
so there is still a gap but the fact

975
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,359
being

976
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,400
that globally we still have far

977
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,320
less women in science and technology

978
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,320
fields and without

979
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,640
onboarding women into stem fields we

980
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,760
will not be able to

981
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,240
close the highly skilled workforce gaps

982
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,000
that cyber security requires

983
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,040
and without women already in the stem

984
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,119
fields we will not be able to mentor

985
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,920
women for future positions which means

986
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,320
it becomes our duty all the women that

987
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,280
are in the field today for example

988
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,480
someone like me

989
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,960
it becomes my duty to be available to

990
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,520
mentor

991
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,599
other women for future positions

992
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,079
and this is another graphic that's

993
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,520
really interesting it's from

994
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,240
um a cyber crime magazine as you can see

995
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,280
here

996
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,720
is that they anticipate um so this is

997
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,480
the current state of women

998
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,400
and they anticipate that we'll have

999
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,520
roughly about 3.5 million women

1000
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,040
in by 2021 although no one might have

1001
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,320
anticipated

1002
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,920
the kovid 19 global pandemic which means

1003
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,359
all of the numbers that have been

1004
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,359
projected before 2020

1005
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:57,440
are literally in a manner of skew now

1006
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,520
because of the pandemic so the numbers

1007
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,680
vary

1008
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,680
now here is another graphic that tells

1009
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,839
you the male versus female cybersecurity

1010
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,040
workforce composition

1011
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,400
by region so if you look at asia pacific

1012
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,000
there's only 10 percent

1013
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,480
of the population are female in

1014
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,880
cybersecurity workforce

1015
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,720
whereas if you look at north america

1016
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,160
although it's not very great but

1017
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,760
it's 14 percent so you have to look at

1018
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,960
all of this data to

1019
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,240
understand why having women in cyber

1020
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,280
security

1021
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,680
is such an important topic for us and

1022
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,440
why we have to really work towards it

1023
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,320
this is another graphic that that shows

1024
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:38,800
the

1025
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,000
ratio of uh men versus women

1026
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,400
in the types of roles that they do

1027
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,520
and then as you can see um

1028
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,599
engineering data ai engineering and

1029
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,119
cloud computing

1030
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,200
it progressively gets lesser and lesser

1031
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,119
so you've got barely 12 percent

1032
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,920
of females working in cloud computing so

1033
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,079
these are some of the more granular

1034
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,960
data that you can look at to understand

1035
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,599
where

1036
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,560
gaps exist and what are those areas that

1037
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,960
you can potentially get into

1038
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,880
as you think about workforce joining the

1039
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,320
workforce and

1040
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,720
about learning skills that are relevant

1041
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,440
to help you

1042
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,720
get into that workforce

1043
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,880
here's another graph that tells where

1044
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,359
are

1045
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,359
male and female distributed across

1046
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:28,880
different roles

1047
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,680
so you can see the blue slice of pie

1048
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,320
that you see

1049
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,160
is a share of women across all of those

1050
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,280
roles that you see here and the rest is

1051
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,520
all dominated by men

1052
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,839
which means we really have a lot of work

1053
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:44,720
to do

1054
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,839
as women

1055
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,440
but it's not just about women not

1056
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,359
getting into stem enough or it's not

1057
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,520
about women not being in the workforce

1058
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,240
enough

1059
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,400
there are issues why women aren't able

1060
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,760
to get into stem

1061
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,640
and there are issues why women aren't in

1062
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,839
the workforce as we might want them to

1063
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:09,040
and one of those issues are

1064
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,280
comes around to gender discrimination

1065
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,880
and this is a

1066
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,839
piece of data that you can see here that

1067
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:16,640
shows

1068
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,960
unconscious discrimination as a majority

1069
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,160
the major reason

1070
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,000
that women do not continue

1071
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,400
to thrive in the industry and that's a

1072
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,480
pretty high number 87 percent of

1073
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,320
unconscious discrimination what does it

1074
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:32,720
mean

1075
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,359
that means we don't even realize that we

1076
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,440
are discriminating women

1077
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,720
87 of women say think that

1078
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,240
that there's a lot of unconscious

1079
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,000
discrimination this is one of the most

1080
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,480
easiest and one that we can tackle by

1081
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,599
understanding

1082
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,480
that human as human beings we have bias

1083
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,760
and fallacies

1084
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,359
and by recognizing those bias and

1085
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,040
fallacies we can actually

1086
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,280
overcome some of this unconscious

1087
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,040
discrimination

1088
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,320
and then across the other factors

1089
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,040
we can definitely work through gender

1090
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,520
policies within our organizations within

1091
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,480
even within

1092
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,560
it and cyber security organizations to

1093
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,240
make sure that there are good gender

1094
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,040
policies

1095
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,440
to support women to support your

1096
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,359
colleagues women colleagues

1097
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:20,000
and mentor them and make sure that they

1098
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,560
feel

1099
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,640
wanted and invited as part of the team

1100
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,759
across different roles

1101
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,160
so some of the suggestions that i have

1102
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,050
is

1103
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,960
[Music]

1104
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,680
we really have to mentor women we have

1105
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,800
to help them

1106
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,440
we have to recognize to begin with what

1107
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,800
are the barriers that women

1108
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,560
face and some of these barriers will be

1109
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,400
easy to tackle through policies

1110
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,359
and sometimes by education and awareness

1111
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:52,800
those are some of the easiest one that

1112
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,520
we can

1113
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,599
resolve but then there are the harder

1114
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,000
ones the harder ones are getting more

1115
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,920
women into stem

1116
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,240
even harder ones are in certain part of

1117
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,200
the culture

1118
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,000
perhaps a woman has difficulty staying

1119
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,680
in her field of work

1120
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,839
because either she's of a marriageable

1121
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,200
age or

1122
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,440
she needs to get married or she needs to

1123
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,720
have children

1124
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,119
there are different social and cultural

1125
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:17,839
norms

1126
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:22,000
that bind women to duties

1127
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,760
that the gender stereotypical duties

1128
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,880
that we ask of them so perhaps by

1129
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,560
becoming aware

1130
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,560
and creating policies that are much more

1131
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,680
conducive

1132
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,920
and women friendly we'll be able to have

1133
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,760
more women and retain more women

1134
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,760
in our industry in cyber security

1135
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,040
i do have a few links towards the end of

1136
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,680
this slide i put them in appendix

1137
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,000
but please do feel free to go through

1138
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,359
them because they are quite useful

1139
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:52,240
resources

1140
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,680
although i will not be going through

1141
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,800
them in our presentation here

1142
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,760
so i hope this brief overview of what

1143
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,280
industrial security is

1144
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,200
how cyber security is interconnected

1145
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,319
with our lives

1146
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,560
and now why this matters in our present

1147
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,440
context of

1148
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,200
industrial industry 4.0

1149
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,000
is relevant and especially relevant to

1150
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,800
women

1151
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,040
because the workforce lacks women

1152
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,720
visibly lacks women

1153
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,599
and then there are barriers that prevent

1154
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,680
women from coming into the workforce

1155
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,160
staying in the workforce if we address

1156
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,200
these barriers

1157
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,079
we will have more people available to

1158
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:30,960
defend

1159
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,119
the growing number of attacks that we

1160
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,839
face as we bring more and more devices

1161
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:38,079
onto the internet so i hope this is

1162
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:38,880
helpful

1163
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:45,200
and thank you very much for joining us
