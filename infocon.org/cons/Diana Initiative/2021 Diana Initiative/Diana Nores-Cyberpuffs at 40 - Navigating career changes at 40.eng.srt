1
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,759
i'm just going to go ahead and jump

2
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,000
right in

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,760
i've um

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,880
i wanted to share this uh cyberpuff 40

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,800
plus story with you because this is a

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,640
personal story

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,960
in many ways and um

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,760
it's

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,280
it made a lot of sense to me i thought

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,239
it was a singular case and it turns out

11
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,120
in the

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,800
in the last a few years in talking to

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,840
many of you

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,960
at conferences and gatherings and so on

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,079
um i realized it's it's really just a

16
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,239
another um

17
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,399
another just another story so i'm pretty

18
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,680
regular um

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,760
who are the the

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,120
powerpuff girls uh this has been a thing

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,559
of mine

22
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,520
at the end of the 1990s uh there was a

23
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,479
show

24
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,560
called the powerpuff girls and they were

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,439
these three sometimes four little girls

26
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,560
that went on and conquered the world and

27
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,360
did

28
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,479
phenomenal things and big monsters and

29
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,600
they did all that while just being girls

30
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,479
and

31
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,520
i encouraged my students

32
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,799
uh to be those powerpuff girls and to

33
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,960
succeed and to do

34
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,360
uh the impossible and

35
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,400
uh told them that it's it's okay it's

36
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,759
it's normal

37
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,680
to be in uh

38
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,880
um

39
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,759
in inferior inferiority sometimes but

40
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,920
that our skills and our percep

41
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,280
perseverance and our

42
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,040
um our determination would actually

43
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,520
bring us through so fast forward to um

44
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,119
that being into

45
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,119
the time when the feminism was really

46
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,159
kicking in

47
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,040
uh that made a real

48
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,959
real connection to me with what i was

49
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,560
trying to do in

50
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,080
in my line of work i started in

51
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,360
education

52
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,440
and i liked using all kind of

53
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,840
tools and i soon figured out that um

54
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,720
those tools were unregulated those tools

55
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,200
were new those companies that created

56
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,800
those tools

57
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,599
actually didn't

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,080
didn't know what the requirements were

59
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,800
in education they didn't really consider

60
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,560
a lot of the requirements so i started

61
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,640
investigating and talking to companies

62
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,800
and trying to resolve some things and

63
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,920
about 10 years ago

64
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,920
i was involved in a project i had to

65
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,280
create a project

66
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,640
from nothing

67
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,958
and

68
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,879
i i was sweeped into this

69
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,560
cyber security

70
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,360
and

71
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,200
privacy and so on because to me these

72
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,840
two work hand-in-hand especially in

73
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,599
education and um

74
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,519
i got familiar with the

75
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,200
with the field but never really stepped

76
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,440
foot into it as forward a few years

77
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,120
later 10 years later

78
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,720
in my 40s

79
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,560
interested in

80
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,560
uh pursuing that because i really

81
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,680
enjoyed uh being part of it and

82
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,440
uh making a difference

83
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,720
and creating something for um

84
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,480
for my students and for my teachers and

85
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,640
just just making a difference

86
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,440
looking in cyber security

87
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,640
we are

88
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,799
apparently about

89
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,120
um

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,440
24

91
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,680
now uh there is a debate between 20 and

92
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,720
24 of women being in cyber security uh i

93
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,239
think that

94
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,239
there's a bit of confusion i don't think

95
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,239
everybody is really thinking about cyber

96
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,480
security most of um

97
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,720
the people interviewed out of which only

98
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,480
a quarter were women um

99
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,959
they may think that it is cyber security

100
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,959
sometimes it may not be

101
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:09,920
um

102
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,040
but

103
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,760
we did make it to 24 so we're just going

104
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,320
to shoot with a with a higher number

105
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,358
and

106
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,798
um

107
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,478
yeah we made it

108
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,320
but

109
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,479
let's look at the job vacancy so right

110
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,800
now there are 53 percent of the jobs on

111
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,680
the market vacant in

112
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,240
nit

113
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,720
so um

114
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,440
out of those uh 53 percent only five

115
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,479
percent are um

116
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,440
are

117
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,000
taken by women

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,680
and if we look all over the world

119
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,960
globally uh there's a huge need of cyber

120
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,479
security workforce

121
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,000
in

122
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,919
in all the countries and all over in

123
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,960
albany's institutions which

124
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,960
makes more uh

125
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,120
begs more of a of a question is where

126
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,039
did the cyber pros come from

127
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:19,759
so

128
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,160
let's take a look at first of all

129
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,840
what kind of education do they need to

130
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,919
have and in um the iec 2's

131
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,440
report for 2020 the 2021 is actually

132
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,039
being developed right now

133
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,240
um

134
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,360
the most education the majority

135
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,680
of education that staff has is bachelor

136
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,120
degrees and master's degrees

137
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,800
follow so there are a lot of

138
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,000
educated professionals in the field

139
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,919
out of those uh 44 are millennials and

140
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,319
about 39

141
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,639
ish are um

142
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,039
are gen x so what does that mean well

143
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,240
that means that the gen x are

144
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,520
people

145
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,840
over 35 so

146
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,840
yay we do have a presence

147
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,960
however

148
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,960
uh in looking at

149
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,199
what is that presence we can see that

150
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,240
it's actually um

151
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,720
majority from education institution

152
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,039
graduates so a lot of young people which

153
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,440
is amazing and it's very empowering for

154
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,319
me as a teacher and as a

155
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,160
participant in education and as an

156
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,720
educator to see that

157
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,440
we are advancing these these young

158
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,360
people but the topic of today is uh what

159
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,360
if you're not that kind of person

160
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,720
uh what if you are um a career changer

161
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,639
and you can see here the career changers

162
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,440
only amount to 23

163
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,120
and um

164
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,960
those 23 percent

165
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,360
out of those it's probably only about

166
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,680
three or four percent that are women

167
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,919
um

168
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,720
that actually try to to repurpose and

169
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,360
move into

170
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,800
um

171
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,759
into cyber security so the fun thing is

172
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,599
uh ise 3's report entitles the women in

173
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,280
cyber security

174
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,560
report

175
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,599
with

176
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:18,720
young

177
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,919
educated and ready to take charge so

178
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,720
i know that uh

179
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,440
this is a really powerful thing we want

180
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,520
our young people to be able to be in the

181
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,199
workforce immediately and make a

182
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,319
difference and that's great

183
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,120
education is so important and this is

184
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,120
what i strive to do with my students as

185
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,360
well but ready to take charge

186
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,639
is

187
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,319
is just something that applies to

188
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,639
everybody so i'm just going to look into

189
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,039
how can we become ready to take charge

190
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,160
since we can't become young anymore

191
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,800
so the cyber workforce pay by age group

192
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,960
is uh one of the things that i wanted to

193
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,360
to look at we all know that there is a

194
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,400
huge discrepancy in treatment and

195
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,280
opportunities and training and of course

196
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,280
in pay for

197
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,680
men versus women

198
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,639
and

199
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,599
you can see this is a little bit of an

200
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,599
interpretation of the report

201
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,080
at different age groups the millennials

202
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,560
seem to have it a little bit better yay

203
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,599
but

204
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:24,400
um

205
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,960
at generation x already the the gap

206
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,400
widens and the boomers are already uh

207
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,919
way outside the

208
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,958
the work so what can be done about that

209
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,320
um

210
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,719
the general exception is that because

211
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,958
there are issues with

212
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:41,760
um

213
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,519
filling in the positions because there

214
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,519
is no um

215
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,040
certified professional workforce or

216
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,440
professional workforce that can actually

217
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,720
take uh take over and fill the job gap

218
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
there is a high interest in

219
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,399
building skills so one of the items

220
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,720
that i want to focus on today is how do

221
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,480
you build skills

222
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,480
or do you already have them and how do

223
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,080
you build on the skills that you already

224
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,640
have so one of the

225
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,040
reports that i was looking at

226
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,160
recently

227
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,760
was

228
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,240
one of the tripwire reports

229
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,519
the

230
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,800
respondents in totality so everybody

231
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,680
said

232
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,279
they consider the soft skills to be

233
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,839
important in um hiring for a security

234
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:30,880
team

235
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,519
and um

236
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,279
some actually went as far as saying

237
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,680
those are more important

238
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,519
the soft skills are more important than

239
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,279
the hard skills which is the technical

240
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,040
skills i don't know that i would go that

241
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,600
far if you do go into the technical part

242
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,839
of cyber security so not into the

243
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,399
project management and so on and

244
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,640
organizational

245
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,880
you you really want to to know what

246
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,640
you're doing and those technical skills

247
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,040
are very important but they are probably

248
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,120
equally important as the soft skills

249
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,480
another thing um that's been tried to do

250
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,839
is

251
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,120
expand

252
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,600
the experience of newly graduates

253
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,839
so anybody graduating from college with

254
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,920
internships or work study or

255
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,640
apprenticeships or some form of

256
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,480
on-the-job experience

257
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,200
so my thinking was well

258
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,279
and i do that in my institution

259
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,200
today

260
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,920
what if companies and institutions would

261
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,120
actually encourage um on the job for

262
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,760
everybody who comes in so just you know

263
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,240
hiring them at whatever a lower grade

264
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,000
and allowing them and just putting them

265
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,399
on a path of certification so that would

266
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,640
be an incredible thing

267
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,720
uh to actually build from inside and

268
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,399
retain that workforce

269
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,480
so the conundrum is you have all these

270
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,079
educated people

271
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,160
who come um

272
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,279
from

273
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,079
college but they lack in

274
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,440
soft skills

275
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,440
and then on the other side you have all

276
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,760
these um

277
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,839
mature professionals who would like to

278
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,160
switch over they have the soft skill

279
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,560
but they don't really have the

280
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,320
the technical skill or much of the

281
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,959
knowledge so what do we do about that

282
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,200
well this is where the seasoned

283
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,200
professional from any other field comes

284
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,000
in and um

285
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,360
this is

286
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,320
how anybody who is interested in moving

287
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,200
into cyber security can can proceed

288
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,880
what does that mean because everybody's

289
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,560
saying well yeah it's easy for you to

290
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,440
say you've been dabbling in this and you

291
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,839
know you had the opportunities

292
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,399
yes and no um dabbling is how you start

293
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,640
you start with

294
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,120
what you bring to the table you

295
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,720
have to know who you are you have

296
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,200
transferable skills you have your life

297
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,680
experience which is probably

298
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,959
the most important thing that you're

299
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,360
bringing to the table uh you have soft

300
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,680
skills which are again crucial to the

301
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,079
job and you have your superpower

302
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,040
uh mothering i say that mothering is a

303
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,880
superpower because

304
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,399
um

305
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,680
if

306
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,120
you have a child

307
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,560
or more

308
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,519
you know that parenting is

309
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,040
a job in itself

310
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,120
and balancing that with all of the

311
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,959
activities that come with the children

312
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,000
is another job in itself and then to add

313
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,600
to that your own professional career or

314
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,399
work interests or passions

315
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,079
those become other things so

316
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,480
somehow we just make that possible we do

317
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,560
raise wonderful children we do prepare

318
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,120
them for the future and we do try to

319
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,519
pursue our dreams

320
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,200
when the time comes

321
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
so when we're ready to return and so on

322
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,720
so those are your superpowers your

323
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,160
organization skills and your

324
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,639
determination and your willingness to

325
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,880
make something happen are important and

326
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,680
then there's your passion so

327
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,600
i know there has been a lot of talk

328
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,839
about the big money that's been made in

329
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:02,720
i.t

330
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,160
um

331
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,360
and it's wonderful and i think um

332
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,839
a lot of people do look at the

333
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,560
the finance factor too

334
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,000
i really believe it's the passion that

335
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,480
makes us go and switch a career because

336
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,160
for me for example

337
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,399
when i started having issues with um

338
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,920
various applications that didn't play

339
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,519
with each other

340
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,680
i had to really go deep into what is

341
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,560
really technically happening and why do

342
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,560
my i.t people

343
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,480
not handle it and it was because they

344
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,440
didn't know how and that was just not

345
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,880
okay for me

346
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,639
to just stop my project because there's

347
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,399
no knowledge so i started researching on

348
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,040
my own and that was because i was

349
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,240
interested in resolving the issue and

350
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,320
then it became interesting to see what

351
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,720
is happening in the background and why

352
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,920
do things um happen a certain way so

353
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,920
making those connections

354
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,800
are fueled by your own passion

355
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,800
so i've made a list of transferable

356
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,160
skills uh in talking to peers to women

357
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,480
my age older and so on and by the way i

358
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,120
had a tweet that was super awesome today

359
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,240
uh will any of this help people over 60.

360
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,680
yes this should help anybody at any age

361
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,360
not just um

362
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,440
40 40 plus

363
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,680
not just um

364
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,560
you know

365
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,120
graduates and so on this is applicable

366
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,480
to all levels to all ages

367
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,760
so i'm just gonna do um just a little

368
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,240
sweep through what i feel that has

369
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,079
helped me the most

370
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,199
um

371
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,760
is creativity and problem solving

372
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,519
we bring those with us

373
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,279
as women we are

374
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,560
somehow naturally inclined to

375
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,360
uh creatively problem solve to make

376
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,440
something out of nothing to figure

377
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,040
things out to

378
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,040
jump through hoops to

379
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,040
uh bypass hurdles

380
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,279
uh so i guess you can say that that is

381
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,519
our analytical reasoning helping us do

382
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,399
that

383
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,399
the other thing that i feel is very

384
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,839
important to bring with you when you

385
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,639
move into a cyber security

386
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,320
career is

387
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,920
patience

388
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,120
systems

389
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,839
they are

390
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,839
zeros and ones and they don't play well

391
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,000
with people so you do have to bring all

392
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,320
of your p or of your patients also

393
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,320
systems are

394
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,839
departmentalized

395
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,399
and they live in silos so the people who

396
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,120
are in charge of them and whom you need

397
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,320
to work with

398
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,880
very closely will have their own way of

399
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,959
doing things which you already know from

400
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,120
working in any other job

401
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,639
working inter you know

402
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,720
intra-departmentally

403
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,000
so you will bring that patience with you

404
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,560
that will serve you probably the best

405
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,839
uh forecasting what can happen if so the

406
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,480
what ifs i'm an educator so in my life

407
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,839
the what-ifs were uh always present

408
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,240
so it's really interesting to

409
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,560
uh to see everybody that i'm working

410
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,120
with already know that during a meeting

411
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,240
or

412
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,440
um

413
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,440
during a

414
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,519
a crisis or a problem that we're trying

415
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,120
to solve

416
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,800
i would just

417
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,320
open them out to say it and they would

418
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,360
say but what if before i even get to say

419
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,759
it because that is the

420
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,399
uh the possibility the forecasting okay

421
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,320
so if this happens then you can have

422
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,839
options a b c d how does that uh develop

423
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,440
well

424
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,399
again going back to being women and

425
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,680
going through life for a number of years

426
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,160
we learn to forecast what could happen

427
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,079
because we want to have a plan so

428
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,320
planning is another um

429
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,320
important skill that we bring with us so

430
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,000
these are all transferable skills

431
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,079
the soft skills that we bring with us

432
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,160
that are probably the most important

433
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,600
because especially in it

434
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,160
more so in cyber security communication

435
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,480
and collaboration are

436
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,919
vital

437
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,640
those are

438
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,599
so valued by everybody in

439
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,280
in

440
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,359
all the companies in management and so

441
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,439
on because no system will work unless

442
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,000
everybody participates understands and

443
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,640
collaborates so being able to

444
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,039
collaborate and talk to

445
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,039
everybody to the people

446
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,160
involved is super important and i feel

447
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,600
that this is something that needs to go

448
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,120
on your resume with examples of

449
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,039
mediating groups or

450
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,360
creating ways for communication

451
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,640
improvements

452
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,280
or collaboration or

453
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,360
teamwork another thing that's very

454
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,880
important to list is the leadership so

455
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,160
we

456
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,760
lead every day and i'm saying we as in

457
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,960
we humans not we women alone so

458
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,039
everybody's a leader every day we make

459
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,080
decisions sometimes um on behalf of

460
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,080
groups sometimes we um

461
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,840
don't even make the decision we make the

462
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,480
suggestions sometimes we serve

463
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,640
and we are the servant leader that leads

464
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,760
by example so all of those ways that we

465
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,720
lead

466
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,919
um

467
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,360
this is something that you really want

468
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,039
to think about

469
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,880
in how your career can be impacted by

470
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,280
and then adaptability so

471
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,960
being a mom for me it was

472
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,880
very interesting to observe myself

473
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,080
move from my life has to be this way and

474
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,840
this is our daily schedule

475
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,360
and

476
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,240
i work from this hour to this hour to

477
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,679
having

478
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:54,720
children

479
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,799
and having a

480
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,280
high responsibility of work and having

481
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,080
to be on call sometimes

482
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,919
at all on hours

483
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,039
and then

484
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,280
figuring out how to do everything and

485
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,080
still have so eating my cake and having

486
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,360
it too

487
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,120
this is something that we do as parents

488
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,080
this is something that um

489
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,210
i think um

490
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:21,919
[Music]

491
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,480
we need to to emphasize as our soft

492
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,600
skills

493
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,280
uh another thing that i would like to

494
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,440
point out is the curiosity this is

495
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,760
something that um

496
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,200
we do

497
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,600
as women we have curiosity we want to

498
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,720
learn we are naturally um

499
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,559
endowed with this

500
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,080
desire to see how things work to

501
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,919
um improve

502
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,200
to

503
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,760
do better

504
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,360
and

505
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,679
well the more you work and i like that

506
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,320
comment the more you work the more um

507
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,960
you have to compromise your life balance

508
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,919
and i agree partly with that

509
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,559
but maybe not so much because here's

510
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,799
this is again we're going back to why at

511
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,799
40 plus by 40 plus

512
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,120
you already kind of know what you want

513
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,360
to be when you grow up so

514
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,640
uh you know what you're willing the time

515
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,159
that you're willing to put in and

516
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,400
the amount of effort that you want to

517
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,760
put in and how your family is fitting

518
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,039
into that

519
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,840
and

520
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,360
um there's there's a lot of

521
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,760
you that makes the decision more than

522
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,080
the job making the decision for you

523
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,640
so in any career so switching over and

524
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,360
making uh sure you understand what that

525
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,520
life balance is for you it's very

526
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,000
important

527
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,640
so

528
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,000
the other thing that we bring to the

529
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,240
table is the passion so for me

530
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,840
personally and i want to share this

531
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,240
because i've heard that so many times

532
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,400
and i thought oh here i am you know

533
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,120
struggling to to do this thing and being

534
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,000
a woman in a man's field and it's just

535
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,039
so

536
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,360
um

537
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,840
you know

538
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,200
hard

539
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,159
to do everything and be a parent and

540
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,240
be successful and still have a you know

541
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,640
like a life

542
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,960
an adult life and just managing

543
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,960
everything and

544
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,520
what kept me was my passion and this

545
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,280
passion i thought oh you know this is

546
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,039
what brings me and makes me you know

547
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,520
makes me tick makes me roll makes me go

548
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,000
well it turns out that i'm

549
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,840
so not unique in that and it was so

550
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,000
disappointing and so reassuring and so

551
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,080
such a breath of fresh air to see

552
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,679
you don't you don't need to

553
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,679
know how to do everything on your own

554
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,520
because everybody else around you has

555
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,520
the same passion they are there because

556
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,799
they want to and by everybody i mean

557
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,520
everybody who's struggling like you so i

558
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,880
really like

559
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,159
um

560
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,480
getting into networking groups and

561
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,400
talking with you now or talking in um

562
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,880
in any kind of group

563
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,720
uh

564
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,480
because what i feel it's the most

565
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,559
important is actually the passion that

566
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,640
keeps you going and

567
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,799
commiserating with somebody else who

568
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,159
goes through the same thing with you is

569
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,080
really powerful that really builds

570
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,080
something and it's um

571
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,360
really allowing you as a person to

572
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,000
come to terms with who you are and kind

573
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,360
of try to

574
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,679
to understand okay well

575
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,080
this is my support group

576
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,640
we can build together

577
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,559
i don't care who they are they don't

578
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,880
care who i am we just do this because we

579
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,000
want to so this is again this is

580
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,440
the bigger thing about uh passion for me

581
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,360
and um

582
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,360
what do you do with your passion what do

583
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,320
you do with a need what do you do with

584
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,720
your struggles and so on so anybody

585
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,960
who's wanting to move and again this is

586
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,919
for um

587
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,360
those of us who are at

588
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,799
a certain age when we are mature

589
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,520
and we are

590
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,400
i'm just going to say

591
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,360
ready to be

592
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,760
more than what we are right now

593
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,039
um

594
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,880
what do you do

595
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,960
practically because all this is very

596
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,799
i've been always told you're such a

597
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,880
dreamer why why do you even bother you

598
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,120
know it's it's so hard to make it it's

599
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,760
so hard to to just

600
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,520
you know in

601
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,000
insert yourself into this career

602
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,919
and um

603
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,400
it's just

604
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,640
something that you have to do at your

605
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,760
own pace so for that um my personal

606
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,120
example i'm a single parent um i'm a

607
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,400
woman in a very

608
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,600
masculine

609
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,000
environment

610
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,520
i've had to upward manage a lot

611
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,159
but at the same time i had to learn a

612
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,400
lot and because i'm a single parent

613
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,520
because it's not always easy

614
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,159
um

615
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,159
get the knowledge and so on i have been

616
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,720
blessed with a lot of mentors that were

617
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,840
um

618
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,159
willing and men or women that were

619
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,799
willing to to talk with me and uh just

620
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,480
just open themselves to questions and

621
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,880
show me around and give me pointers and

622
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,559
so on but

623
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,640
um

624
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,799
training free training for me was very

625
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,360
important and free being the word there

626
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,880
are a lot of programs including in my

627
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,360
institution that are really great and

628
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,360
they really do prepare you for all kind

629
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,960
of careers at any age so that's you know

630
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,720
just not uh

631
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,120
something just for young people

632
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,559
but i don't have the time nor the

633
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,559
finances to do that so this free

634
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,480
training is online that's the good part

635
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,159
about it

636
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,720
most of it comes with certification

637
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,559
pathways

638
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,200
most of it is very official so just

639
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,640
having the fact that you did the

640
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,000
training on your um

641
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,520
resume is probably

642
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,000
you know a good pointer a good start but

643
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,919
just going through this training and my

644
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,080
favorite one is cyborg i've used it with

645
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,960
my students in high school i use this

646
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,600
with my students in higher ed

647
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,640
i feel it's phenomenal we do have people

648
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,400
who try to certify

649
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,039
professionals from the field i'm in the

650
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,200
backyard of nasa so

651
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,279
you know i have a lot of the

652
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,039
the security people coming in and

653
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,279
training and so on

654
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,240
so

655
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,400
i do recommend that

656
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,159
um

657
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:08,840
to

658
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,760
everybody uh the cyborg i.t but then

659
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,480
cyberaces is also a good one and one of

660
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,480
my favorite is um

661
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,320
sans um sans or however it's uh it's

662
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,960
pronounced i really really really like

663
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,200
it because um

664
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,360
i've worked with sans before

665
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,039
uh they have a

666
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,600
very rigorous methodology to their

667
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,679
training so it's easy to understand easy

668
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:39,120
to follow easy to apply so um

669
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,559
i see somebody's

670
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,480
transfer people transferring skills

671
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,120
there julie

672
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,880
um

673
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,200
one thing that i would like to to bring

674
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,720
to you is

675
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,360
all of us have power in numbers so on

676
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,520
our own we're

677
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,960
just a woman

678
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,400
or just an i.t security person or just

679
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,720
the project manager but

680
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,640
through means like this like the diana

681
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,520
initiative and the vices and so on other

682
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,799
organizations that i actually have um we

683
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,679
can influence and this comes from

684
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,960
being able to

685
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,679
uh

686
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,320
to project

687
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,559
how do you project so as a teacher i

688
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,320
have to give you this example because

689
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,399
it's probably the easiest way to to

690
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,039
explain it as a teacher i had a huge

691
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,080
class of 30 plus up to about 50 students

692
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,720
in in one room and those students would

693
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,039
come in various abilities and um

694
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,159
those

695
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,840
students would also have their own

696
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,240
personalities so think of it now apply

697
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,760
that to your

698
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,679
it

699
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,120
and companies and structure dynamics and

700
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,840
so on so

701
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,840
as a teacher when i couldn't get the

702
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,799
class attention was because i was boring

703
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,120
so that was you know one of the things

704
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,320
that i learned in my first year of

705
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,600
teaching do not be boring be on point

706
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,480
be

707
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,559
interesting and be

708
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,000
um

709
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,120
be the fire starter so this is what i do

710
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,760
up to to now um

711
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,760
i like to to meddle

712
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,660
and figure out you know how do we

713
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,880
[Music]

714
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,960
how do we how do we do more how do we

715
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,480
bring more women in

716
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,520
in not just cyber security but in i.t

717
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,159
um women are so practical and they're so

718
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,760
logical and they come with so many

719
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,200
applied skills

720
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,279
what's wrong with us why can't we just

721
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,880
make it other than the fact that

722
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,799
traditionally women have not been there

723
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,559
and it's a slow process

724
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,159
but what can we do to actually bring

725
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,840
more people more people like us

726
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,039
that can work together and

727
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,320
that can

728
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,960
do things together

729
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,279
how do we project so one of the ways

730
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,159
that

731
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,559
um i post it here because i really like

732
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:03,279
the

733
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,679
idea and it's really what i do now to

734
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,000
this day and i did this all my all my

735
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,679
career my 20 year career is

736
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,240
encourage all the women that i know

737
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,399
whether they be five or 55 or 75 to look

738
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,120
at technology to look at the careers in

739
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,440
technology to think okay well what can

740
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,360
you learn about this how do you use this

741
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,679
well what do you think is behind it just

742
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,919
push them to become inquisitive and

743
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,919
just look into uh stem careers and

744
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,440
my own child is in uh in a stem career

745
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,279
because uh

746
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,960
at the age of five

747
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,279
he was demonstrating how to use an ipad

748
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,520
to a class of teachers so that was

749
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,919
phenomenal to me

750
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,600
and it was probably

751
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,520
being the encouragement that i needed at

752
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,240
that point the other thing that i find

753
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,360
so

754
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,399
important is providing mentorships and

755
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,720
support at all levels mentorships and

756
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,039
support at all levels means a lot of

757
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,480
people take a look at us

758
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,120
and by us i mean women in a mature age

759
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,039
and professional careers

760
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,000
and

761
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,679
especially trying to

762
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:18,799
to enter

763
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,799
cyber security or maintain cyber

764
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,840
security careers or

765
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:25,600
just

766
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,159
go higher than what we are right now

767
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,760
and they think well you know she's a

768
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,919
strong woman and she can do it and look

769
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,360
at her and wait to go

770
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,520
being anywhere at any level without

771
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,760
support is terrible so

772
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,919
having um

773
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,320
people support you and mentor you at any

774
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,159
level is very important and this is

775
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:50,799
something that's uh probably my biggest

776
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,120
thorn right now and this is what i'm

777
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,240
trying to

778
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,679
to

779
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,200
advocate for and promote and just stand

780
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,600
up for and project so i'm hoping you

781
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,200
guys can

782
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,360
can help me and yes women in cyber

783
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,440
security is on my list

784
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,159
um and one of the the things that i

785
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,600
think is very important and very

786
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,679
practical for any organization and it

787
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,000
has to start from a fire starter and you

788
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,480
can be that one is establish

789
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,200
organizational diversity goals what does

790
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,519
that mean for women how many women do

791
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,760
you project seeing in your organization

792
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,279
by the end of 2024 which is you know

793
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,200
something that's achievable it's within

794
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,519
the next four years it's three years

795
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,760
it's doable so what do you want do you

796
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,279
want to see five more women do you want

797
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,120
to see two more women and so on it's

798
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,519
very important to to push that envelope

799
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,000
a little bit

800
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,760
and now talking about initiatives

801
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,440
because i saw ron was uh promoting them

802
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,000
ysy says again one of the organizations

803
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,600
that i was first introduced to when i

804
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,840
was working with uh student female

805
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,360
students uh in cyber security and by the

806
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,320
way their name was cyberpuffs they were

807
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,480
the powerpuff girls and i renamed them

808
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,720
cyberpress because people needed to know

809
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,360
that powerpuff girls really could kick

810
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,200
some code and

811
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,679
they just kept on and they are now all

812
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,720
graduates and so on this was a

813
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,080
little while ago

814
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,880
um

815
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,760
just talking about age really right

816
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,960
so um a lot of these are

817
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,880
global many of them are in the us i did

818
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,640
post the ladies in cyber security by

819
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,720
death camp that's in romania that is a

820
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,880
really really strong um

821
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,679
community there i come from romania very

822
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,200
proudly

823
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,440
so i do try to keep in touch with what's

824
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,080
happening there but i also can tell you

825
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,519
that that's one of the countries that

826
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,600
produces the most technical people so um

827
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,600
it's um

828
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,080
something to look at when whenever they

829
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:56,960
have

830
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,960
conferences and gatherings and then is

831
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,120
the networking so

832
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,720
i'm a tinfoil cap kind of person because

833
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,760
i do know enough to know enough

834
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,559
about systems about what happens behind

835
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,240
the networks and so on so i try to limit

836
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,919
my um

837
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,880
social media contribution to networking

838
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,360
which is for me linkedin and twitter so

839
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,360
you can find me on either my contacts

840
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,960
are there

841
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,640
but um

842
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,039
mentoring is at the top of my list so

843
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,360
you can see the largest group is

844
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,440
actually mentors mentee women in cyber

845
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,640
security

846
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,120
uh this is

847
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,000
really um

848
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,919
probably the most needed right now

849
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,080
because

850
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,440
one thing that we don't really think

851
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,679
about when we're trying to achieve a

852
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,240
goal in our careers or switching from a

853
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,200
career to another is

854
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,960
the

855
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,159
mental health and emotional health that

856
00:33:58,159 --> 00:33:59,519
we have to

857
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,240
be able to produce to to sustain

858
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,679
while we're undergoing all this

859
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,440
transformation and that comes while we

860
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,200
are still parents and we are still

861
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,199
adults and we are still trying to

862
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,159
maintain a roof of our heads and so on

863
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,440
so

864
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,440
the importance of networking cannot be

865
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,599
stressed enough and

866
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,839
i do hope that you share this with

867
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:21,679
everybody with the world there's a lot

868
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,918
of unknown and what i've found

869
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,239
um

870
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,440
what i found oh my slide deck is uh

871
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,199
going to be published

872
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,879

873
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,399

874
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,760
initiative will actually have it

875
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,879
so

876
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,399
um yeah it's going to be um

877
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,639
published at the end of the

878
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,918
of the session

879
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,918
i can just send the

880
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:50,000
link to the deck as well

881
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,800
but

882
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,719
um

883
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,719
just going back to the networking it is

884
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,680
very very important to

885
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,040
connect

886
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,200
not because you want to learn not

887
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,520
because you are at a certain level and

888
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,599
you need pointers but because

889
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,440
women need to talk and that is a reality

890
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,839
we need to vent we need this is how we

891
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,400
process our

892
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,400
frustrations our

893
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,520
fears our curiosity this is how we learn

894
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,640
this is how we share this is

895
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,119
just sharing just processing talking

896
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,280
this is the most important thing um

897
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,200
that no we probably have the most

898
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,000
important resource and the other thing

899
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,760
is when you're lost and you will get

900
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,839
lost because at some point

901
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,760
in any woman's life especially when we

902
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,560
turn 40 and going up

903
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,480
with our bodies changing our mind is

904
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,400
changing and then

905
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,480
there will be times when you will need

906
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,280
help

907
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,240
and there are places out there that do

908
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,160
help you

909
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,240
women who need that kind of help they

910
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,640
help you refocus they help you

911
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,520
um reassess they help you just get

912
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,760
yourself ready and present yourself and

913
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,240

914
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,079

964
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,839
to say women

965
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,839
who are near women

966
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,320
are life changers sometimes you can't

967
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,400
empower sometimes you just need to be

968
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,040
there and listen and just

969
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,920
cry

970
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,400
and um

971
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,720
just not even give advice

972
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,680
sometimes you just need to be there

973
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,920
so i just want to leave you with with

974
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,359
that i do hope that um

975
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,119
i get in touch with many of you i don't

976
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:31,839
know

977
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,359
i have

978
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,280
i've watched you just you know

979
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,920
responding and interacting and so on i

980
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,200
am so blind i'm very visual i would love

981
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,119
to be somewhere where i can see you and

982
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,480
interact with you

983
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,440
but

984
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,800
i guess we'll have to wait until the

985
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,680
next time so if you see me ever i'm

986
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,280
super approachable

987
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,520
i may not seem it

988
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,760
because

989
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,440
at my age

990
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,280
in my career

991
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,400
sometimes concentration shows on my face

992
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,800
but if you see me anywhere just come by

993
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,960
and just say hi and talk to me

994
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,599
this is this is the most important thing

995
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,640
for me just connecting with you
