20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,479
you have the floor

21
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,320
hello everyone

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,960
so today i will be speaking about

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,520
manifesting and mastering the art of

24
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,520
executive presence

25
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,840
but before i begin let me start with my

26
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,759
own story

27
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,000
i come from the remotest corner of my

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,119
country

29
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,360
a place wherein

30
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,439
which is rich in medical and

31
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,560
agricultural science but not i.t

32
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,680
so

33
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,640
i had to make sure that i my voice is

34
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,360
hard so what did i do

35
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,360
i started my career as a penetration

36
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,560
tester entered the industry a little shy

37
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,560
i used to be

38
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,240
because

39
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,799
i come from that corner where people are

40
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,240
not known for it right

41
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,479
i went ahead to do mba in cyber security

42
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,600
so that

43
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,320
i could manifest the art of executive

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,240
presence

45
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,280
again it wasn't working

46
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,960
why

47
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,959
no matter how good you are at what you

48
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,800
do no matter how

49
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,280
what you do and

50
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,200
we all are here to climb up the career

51
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,920
ladder right

52
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,840
three elements we require for that

53
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,200
competence confidence warmth anyone

54
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,360
lacking

55
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,599
people don't take you as someone who has

56
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,440
executive presence

57
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,440
and why is executive presence necessary

58
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,800
have you imagined anyone walking into a

59
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,360
room and their aura being so powerful

60
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,280
that you say this is the future leader

61
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,200
that is what is called executive

62
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,400
presence

63
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,879
now imagine

64
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,200
your favorite hero

65
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,080
or for that matter any actor

66
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,879
what is that about that person that you

67
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,239
remember

68
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,800
and what and why is that person

69
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,680
remembered there has been there had been

70
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,319
some spark in that person which makes

71
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,879
that person in

72
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,080
presence immemorial in your memory right

73
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,400
that is executive presence

74
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,959
and why is it necessary

75
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,000
leaders come and go but only few leaders

76
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,239
are able to make a mark

77
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,680
in the world

78
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,000
they are immortal because of the deeds

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,640
they do and because of the legacy they

80
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,360
leave behind even after that

81
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,720
they're dead

82
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,720
so that is the beauty of executive

83
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,519
presence and why is it important is

84
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,799
because

85
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,959
had it not been for executive presence

86
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,200
people would have never taken any person

87
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,920
seriously you can be a big shot hacker

88
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,879
you don't know how to communicate well

89
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,879
you don't climb the career ladders so

90
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,000
easily

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,120
so

92
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,360
that is why this is very important

93
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,400
now

94
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,000
when we talk about women in particular

95
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,239
we are

96
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,720
assumed to not have

97
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,720
strong

98
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,360
authoritative tones

99
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,238
men on the other hand

100
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,000
have a problem with emotional

101
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,279
intelligence

102
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,400
so the empathy factor is rich in women

103
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,720
and emotional uh

104
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,080
intelligence

105
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,440
which is and in men is the authoritative

106
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,759
in general i am talking exceptions are

107
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,080
not example

108
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,680
but you know what

109
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,560
the quality to of vice versa

110
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,199
interchanging both are important for

111
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,600
executive presence you might not be born

112
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,560
with it

113
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,639
good news but you can definitely

114
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,240
manifest it and master it too how

115
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,440
with practice

116
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,639
so when we talk about great leaders

117
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,960
the first person who comes to my mind

118
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,919
because i am also an apple user is steve

119
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,240
jobs

120
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,320
when i say steve jobs

121
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,479
what do you see remember or what can you

122
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,759
visualize

123
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,160
if you at all you are a steve jobs fan

124
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,000
or someone who has

125
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,479
an experience of listening to him his

126
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,160
videos online

127
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,880
his signature speech

128
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,720
that black shirt

129
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,639
blue jeans

130
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,479
that made him unique the way he said

131
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,919
the way he launched the products those

132
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,600
products are

133
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,840
unique even after

134
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,120
his demise apple is something which has

135
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,960
a different set of

136
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,440
audience or consumers

137
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,199
that made him immortal we always

138
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,280
remember steve jobs speeches right

139
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,720
when i talk about michelle obama someone

140
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,880
who looks very powerful

141
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,759
a woman of substance and torrential

142
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,120
authoritative tone

143
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,039
someone we all look up to but her

144
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,440
advantage was being she was a law

145
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,240
candidate so that came a given

146
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,759
so when we talk about sheryl sandberg

147
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,800
she is somebody who chooses to share her

148
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,680
own story she is a good storyteller and

149
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,479
she brings an empathy to the table

150
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,440
so

151
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,280
if you're listening to me

152
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,919
and imagining all these people you will

153
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,919
understand the different traits they

154
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,759
have which made them

155
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,840
so powerful in the world the world knows

156
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,080
them

157
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,919
so

158
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,880
this is something which can be

159
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,280
manifested because these were developed

160
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,600
when we talked about maret thatcher

161
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,759
she developed her tone her tone wasn't

162
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,280
authoritative

163
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,400
but she practiced

164
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,960
a leader we all remember

165
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,520
and there are many other we can go on

166
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,319
and on about these leaders

167
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,479
and their signature styles which made

168
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,680
them someone who we looked up to we

169
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,880
believed in that we can trust them when

170
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,960
testing time comes we gave them the

171
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,120
opportunity to lead us

172
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,520
barack obama

173
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,360
again someone

174
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,759
with very warmth and strong vision

175
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,800
enough said about leaders

176
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,120
we can be one too

177
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,479
how

178
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,199
and why is it important

179
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,199
important because the sooner the better

180
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,639
when you start

181
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,919
practicing

182
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,680
executive presence

183
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,080
from early on in your life at high

184
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,560
stakes communication situation

185
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,479
executive presence become

186
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,680
a routine

187
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,720
small small changes in your life

188
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,879
and your life becomes a better place

189
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,919
people trust you more they give you more

190
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,800
responsibilities which holds risk which

191
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,199
helps you climb up the ladder

192
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,000
and

193
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,240
this is something

194
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,319
which is easily doable

195
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,759
see such a good news isn't it

196
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,879
but in order to have executive presence

197
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,280
there are certain things you need to

198
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,240
look after there are certain behaviors

199
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,879
which you have to be mindful about

200
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,960
what are they and why are they important

201
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,720
because to project confidence

202
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,039
and for people to have confidence in you

203
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,360
these are very important

204
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,080
you believe it or not even when you see

205
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,599
a leader

206
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,399
you tend to observe a leader and

207
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,799
knowingly or unknowingly

208
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,920
to be you wish to be somebody like them

209
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,720
they're always under observation right

210
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,519
so

211
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,760
what is that stands out that is

212
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,760
executive presence and how can it be

213
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,480
manifested it's very simple i am going

214
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,399
to talk about the trick of the trades

215
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,880
and you know what

216
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,080
you will be

217
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,120
amazed how simple it is yet we don't pay

218
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,959
much attention to it

219
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,839
be it any reason

220
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,640
when i talk about it

221
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,600
first thing that comes to my mind

222
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,839
many of us have

223
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,399
a dark past yes

224
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,920
and somehow as humans we tend to get

225
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,800
carried about away with that past i had

226
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,240
one too

227
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,880
i was bullied in my school life

228
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,839
and

229
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,560
which made me lose my self-confidence

230
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,000
i did work hard but when you do not have

231
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,200
confidence

232
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,360
you don't perform well in examination

233
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,920
and that was my problem

234
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,040
what was wrong going wrong with me

235
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,440
the self-pity thing the story i was

236
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,839
telling to myself

237
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,959
it is all about the story you choose to

238
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,800
tell yourself it's

239
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,040
it works on the law of attraction you

240
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,839
are the stories you tell yourself

241
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:02,640
so

242
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,480
first thing first

243
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,880
if at all you have a sad story write

244
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,279
that down on a page and for heaven's

245
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,279
sake go burn that page

246
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,920
and write a new story of success

247
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,680
when you

248
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,839
train your

249
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:18,720
head to

250
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,279
manifest that yes you are going to be

251
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,120
successful there is no force on earth

252
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,920
then can stop you from being successful

253
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,680
change your story first thing

254
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,959
and then few things which

255
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,120
can help you

256
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,440
become a good leader or someone with

257
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,839
executive presence

258
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,680
first

259
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,200
posture

260
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,839
so while listening to me how many of you

261
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,880
are laying down like this or like this

262
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,760
or like this

263
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,800
i'm sure there are many

264
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,839
had it been

265
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,079
someone who has like the executive

266
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,920
presence the person would have said

267
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,360
straight

268
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,000
while listening because it is his or her

269
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,200
habit

270
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,360
small tweaks in posture makes people

271
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,720
take you

272
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,279
very seriously and when you look at

273
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,040
someone of high demeanor

274
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,920
you will observe how smooth their

275
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,279
postures are

276
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,200
and their posture speaks

277
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,959
a lot for them more than they can talk

278
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,240
for themselves

279
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,800
so yes correct posture first thing first

280
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,440
also it helps in keeping your health

281
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,560
okay because with wrong posture you tend

282
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,360
to

283
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,600
uh have different types of problem

284
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,920
physical problems sleep discs and many

285
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,000
other and with the pandemic we have no

286
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,240
choice but to sit most of the time in in

287
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,720
front of our laptop so why not practice

288
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,360
better postures

289
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,040
gestures

290
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,240
the way our

291
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,240
fingers work

292
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,440
how we talk the way we walk

293
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,680
small small things makes big impact

294
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,360
i imagine

295
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,560
two people

296
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,000
all right

297
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,200
same

298
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,839
identical resumes

299
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:10,800
yet

300
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,519
first person sweating while talking

301
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,000
having loose posture not confident about

302
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,160
what to speak

303
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,240
fumbling stammering

304
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,120
has lots of

305
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,399
pillow words

306
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,719
i think the description which i gave

307
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,920
with that if if someone comes to in

308
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,720
front of you the game is over right

309
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,880
second person

310
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,120
chooses words wisely has strong gestures

311
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,040
correct postures

312
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,120
might not know much but very good

313
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,440
communication skills

314
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,320
shows the person is serious and taken

315
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,399
more seriously that person wins the

316
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,399
battle

317
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,760
so this is the importance of having good

318
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,480
posture and gesture

319
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,240
moment

320
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,959
the way your hand stops fingers talks

321
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,360
you know something sometimes we tend to

322
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,200
sit like this because we are very

323
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,480
nervous

324
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,000
sometimes our hands don't move at all

325
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,720
sometimes

326
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,639
we don't know what to do with our hands

327
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,720
there are situations sometime it's under

328
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,079
our pockets

329
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,160
that also happens when we are standing

330
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,480
somewhere

331
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,639
very difficult things

332
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,279
and not a good sign of having executive

333
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,000
presence you know what your fingers are

334
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,800
good storytellers and they can speak

335
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,839
about you or your personality more than

336
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,279
you do

337
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,639
so

338
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,480
learn to speak with your fingers your

339
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,480
hands

340
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,760
when you walk

341
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,720
walk

342
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,600
with your body straight very important

343
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,160
people take you seriously and not with

344
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,000
loose gesture

345
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
small small things

346
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,440
you will

347
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,639
see making

348
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,639
larger impacts in your life

349
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,120
because when you start doing this

350
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,120
in daily routine

351
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,000
your

352
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,480
work or for that matter your life will

353
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,320
will definitely put you in high stake

354
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,639
communication situation in difficult

355
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,079
situation

356
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,639
and that time you do not have to worry

357
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,560
about your executive presence that is

358
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,880
the beauty of practicing these things

359
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,120
day in and day out

360
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,959
so this is very important

361
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,279
language

362
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,600
very important

363
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,600
working on grammar very important

364
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,880
because

365
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,720
people coming from different countries

366
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,040
might have different accent

367
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,199
which is still workable because when in

368
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,920
rome you behave like romans but still

369
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,560
that ethnicity does not go and one

370
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,079
should learn to respect

371
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,079
others ethnicity

372
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,519
yet

373
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,079
with a good grammar with the language

374
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,639
which does not have fillers with proper

375
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,000
pauses

376
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,480
things becomes easier and people look up

377
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,800
to you as a good communicator or

378
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,000
somebody

379
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,839
who will save them

380
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,240
during testing times at high stake

381
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,399
communication situation

382
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,839
so that is the power of language

383
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,240
voice

384
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,880
very loud voice

385
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,720
shows you are nervous

386
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,800
but very low voice

387
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,680
shows your nervous again

388
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,240
modulation invoice shows that you are

389
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,959
well prepared

390
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,399
very important

391
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,040
the pauses between your speech

392
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,440
makes people absorb what you're trying

393
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,480
to say

394
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,759
a very important thing to have

395
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,000
it changes the game for you

396
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,880
and it changes the way people judges you

397
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,199
small tweaks in this

398
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,199
fillers does go how do you work on it

399
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,519
record yourself we all have cell phones

400
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,880
right

401
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,360
record yourself in a phone

402
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,959
tell

403
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,399
uh a story of how where do you see

404
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,880
yourself five years down the line

405
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,040
and then judge

406
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,839
you might say some other question answer

407
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,320
some other question then judge yourself

408
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,320
as being somebody else listening to

409
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,800
somebody else you will identify your

410
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,880
problems in your communication the

411
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,800
fillers will go when you identify that

412
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,440
you have many i did have a problem with

413
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,240
my you know problem

414
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,399
i used to say you know a lot

415
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,040
while talking and that's okay we all are

416
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,160
humans

417
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,040
and the journey won't be perfect that's

418
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,839
a given but you need to practice small

419
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,440
small things practicing

420
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,680
imagining a person talking about

421
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,519
manifesting the art of executive

422
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,639
presence

423
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,079
and having no executive presence herself

424
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,079
first thing you would do

425
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:58,880
is

426
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,240
go and

427
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,920
bash

428
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,039
the organizers who did you bring why is

429
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,119
she having so much fillers why is she

430
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,240
not confident where did we come

431
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,959
i had to practice right it's important

432
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,880
it's part of the game

433
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,679
in life in conferences for that matter

434
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,480
at work better practice

435
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,520
because

436
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,079
even if you're technically sound your

437
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,559
personality still holds the major

438
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,120
chunk of your growth in life

439
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,440
communication is the first kill if you

440
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,440
don't know what you

441
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,799
are doing

442
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,559
or don't know to communicate what you

443
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,160
are doing

444
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,600
it's a difficult thing for people

445
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,600
so it's okay

446
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,200
one more thing

447
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,080
always have a backup

448
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,760
it said two is one one is none

449
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,000
so

450
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,240
your communication whatever you are

451
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,960
going to say or whatever preparation you

452
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,679
have done while you're presenting a ppt

453
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,520
has to have

454
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,039
five versions

455
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,000
if not five let's boil it down to three

456
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,840
which will show that you are five

457
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,840
question deep of what you are going to

458
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,400
say because if at all somebody else

459
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,480
chooses to say the same thing that you

460
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,000
are going to say

461
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,360
or

462
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,200
you are put in a different situation

463
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,760
altogether or somebody throws question

464
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,679
at you

465
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,840
it's

466
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,400
and you it shows that you are not well

467
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,480
prepared for what you are

468
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,520
there

469
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,799
so

470
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,520
five question deep

471
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,160
two is one one is none remember this

472
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,720
have a backup of whatever you are going

473
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,480
to communicate

474
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,720
dig so deep into the subject matter that

475
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,760
nobody can question your authenticity

476
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,799
because

477
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,039
credibility and authenticity is

478
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,280
something people look up to in great

479
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,480
leaders

480
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,880
and that you are credible will come from

481
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,240
your knowledge

482
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,160
because knowledge is power

483
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,880
then

484
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,160
facial expression

485
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,280
imagine

486
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,000
somebody coming here

487
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,240
and having a poker face no smile

488
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,520
or somebody who loves too much

489
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,240
or somebody who is super nervous her

490
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,120
face shows that she is nervous

491
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,360
or somebody who's angry

492
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,600
her personal life anger is shown on the

493
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,640
screen

494
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,400
you know what these things will make the

495
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,880
game over for the person speaking and

496
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,360
also for the uh for how she is look

497
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,960
up to

498
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,440
so your facial expression does a lot of

499
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,200
talking for yourself sometimes you don't

500
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,120
even need words to express what you're

501
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,919
feeling your space speaks it for you so

502
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,039
you know to be that careful as to

503
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,520
what racial expression is required at

504
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,160
what situation you cannot choose to show

505
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,080
that you are nervous if you are and it's

506
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,840
very human to be nervous

507
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,959
because we are humans

508
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,080
but

509
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,280
to show

510
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,559
your weakness

511
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,440
at a high stake communication situation

512
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,520
does the game overflow

513
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,640
so

514
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,799
manifest the art of

515
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,320
keeping calm

516
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,120
at

517
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,840
difficult situations and let the face do

518
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,720
the talking for you

519
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,960
dress

520
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,120
another important thing

521
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,039
there might be rules

522
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,840
but you got to make your own rules

523
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,520
where what you are whatever you are

524
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,960
comfortable in

525
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,480
and most importantly wear a smile

526
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,200
because you cannot spark a journey

527
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,520
if you aren't sparked and that spark

528
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,559
come from

529
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,520
comes from smile

530
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,960
now when we talk about dresses

531
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,840
some people choose to wear light colors

532
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,120
it depends on

533
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,280
everyone's personality choose what you

534
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,080
are most comfortable in i am someone who

535
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,640
has a loud personality loves loud color

536
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,640
bold colors

537
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,640
sometimes just a lipstick does the work

538
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,600
for me

539
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,480
why because i feel very fresh

540
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,679
wearing that

541
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,200
whole lipstick

542
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
but that is me you might not be the same

543
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,200
person

544
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,280
yes what you wear does the talking for

545
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,360
you too especially when you are an

546
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,520
executive and when you are placed in a

547
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,200
high-stakes communication situation

548
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,919
but you don't let anybody else decide

549
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,080
what you are going to wear or how you

550
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,720
are going to carry because

551
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,880
an authentic person will always carry

552
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,720
their own style

553
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,280
that makes you unique right

554
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,600
you might learn from people but you have

555
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,000
to be your own self that's called

556
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,880
authenticity and that makes you credible

557
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,480
people believe in you

558
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,080
only when you know to believe in

559
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,600
yourself and

560
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,520
the small small things the way your

561
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,840
hands work how the way your moment work

562
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,919
the way you dress the way your voice

563
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:08,960
works the

564
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,200
way your facial expression works does

565
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,440
the docking for you and create your

566
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,280
executive presence

567
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,360
now this all things were

568
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,960
also applicable before the pandemic

569
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,159
but with the advent of the pandemic came

570
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,480
another problem in life

571
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,799
what

572
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,880
the camera

573
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,080
virtual conferences virtual meetings

574
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,000
which wasn't the case earlier right

575
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,480
screen executive presence is something

576
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,600
people are still lagging behind

577
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,120
in

578
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,640
manifesting

579
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,080
and mastering

580
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,960
why

581
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,760
most of the time people choose to turn

582
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,840
off the camera to make their life easy

583
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,520
but you know what that takes away the

584
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,840
attention and takes away someone else's

585
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,320
attention also in taking you seriously

586
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,000
your game is over there and then the

587
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,840
moment the person thinks that this

588
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,520
person might be sleeping on the other

589
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,559
end of that camera and that happens

590
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,559
because i'm sure you have also noticed

591
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,400
many people doing that right that is

592
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,080
normal we are all humans come on

593
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,400
learn to turn on your camera

594
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,320
very important

595
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,360
second when we make presentations

596
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,039
we see

597
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,679
uh women tend to use lots of slide to

598
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,760
show that she is very prepared

599
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,480
and that she has done a lot of work

600
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,679
but you know what using lot of ppt

601
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,159
sometimes tend to bore people and it is

602
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,559
not their fault also because in the

603
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,200
pandemic our life has become so

604
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,880
monotonic that

605
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,400
we are watching ppt excel files or

606
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,720
whatever we are doing

607
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,880
at a stretch boring human interaction

608
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,120
makes a difference

609
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,559
how about

610
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,720
knowing what you're going to say up in a

611
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,679
ppt and talking it in the full screen

612
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,919
makes people take you more seriously

613
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,440
that is the reason today i did not

614
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,000
choose to have a ppt i do have a ppt but

615
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,400
i am not sharing it if at all you need

616
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,480
it i'll be sharing it to the organizers

617
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,840
and your work will be done

618
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,480
why because i

619
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,240
chose

620
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,400
to show my executive presence as simple

621
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,520
as that and also not to bore you

622
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,000
because i get bored when people use too

623
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,880
many ppt's and also when those ppts are

624
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,880
two verbose

625
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,039
it takes away the energy of the listener

626
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,360
you know and it's very important that

627
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,880
you don't do that

628
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,039
so that people take you more seriously

629
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,799
and know that you have executive

630
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,520
presence that spark in you that is how

631
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,159
people tend to believe you but for that

632
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,960
matter you have to be very good at what

633
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,039
you are going to speak you have to be

634
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,440
five question deep

635
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,400
and that's possible little practice

636
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,320
little more confidence

637
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,799
little good story about yourself the law

638
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,559
of attraction

639
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,919
all these things

640
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,640
churn into a cohesive holes make you a

641
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,799
person with a good executive presence

642
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,799
and trust me it is very

643
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,520
easy to manifest

644
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,880
also

645
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,039
at zoom meetings

646
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,760
people sometimes don't tend to change

647
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,159
their background

648
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,559
images

649
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,400
which is okay but then you got to have a

650
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,760
calm background and not chaotic

651
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,320
because you know what we all are

652
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,880
troubled with our screens

653
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,640
how about

654
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,520
a pleasant screen

655
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,320
so

656
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,320
i practice what i speak what do you see

657
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,760
here

658
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,679
a dream catcher my books the message the

659
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,600
future is bright

660
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,880
this is my working area i keep the vibe

661
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,799
vibrant and lively

662
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,679
not for people just the people who are

663
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:08,799
watching me

664
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,480
but also for myself

665
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,440
i feel at peace with myself because i

666
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,440
know my future is bright i have a dream

667
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,200
catcher and i know i have lots of book

668
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,320
to read

669
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,159
simple things you see

670
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,840
makes so much difference

671
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,000
right okay

672
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,919
now

673
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,200
also

674
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,360
when you

675
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,600
are talking in any conferences or

676
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,760
seminar or for that matter at a high

677
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,840
stake

678
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,240
communication situation

679
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,679
you got to turn off your notifications

680
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,279
another thing

681
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,600
which you should practice as a good

682
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,320
executive presence person

683
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,120
so

684
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,840
again

685
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,919
small small things big big differences

686
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,120
makes people take you seriously and also

687
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,120
because people will not should not know

688
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,440
what's going on in your life when you

689
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,480
have a slack channel or some other app

690
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,000
which shows personal messages

691
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,960
it

692
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,559
is something

693
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:13,679
which

694
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:14,880
gives

695
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,760
a thought of social engineering right so

696
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,440
you have to be mindful

697
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,919
your computer is your

698
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,200
work of worship it's your place where

699
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,279
money breeds

700
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,559
which gives

701
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,799
makes you who you are so you have to

702
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,039
mind be mindful to keep your own

703
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,840
information or data secretive very

704
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,399
important

705
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,360
also

706
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,320
learn to be a little

707
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,240
loose on yourself

708
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,640
don't be very strict with yourself

709
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,120
we are all in the pandemic you might

710
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,600
burp there might be a dog

711
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,399
lots of things might happen

712
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,200
just learn to absorb that it's okay

713
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,520
you don't have to be too conscious about

714
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,159
what what's going on around

715
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,520
it's 1 30 a.m in india my dog might bark

716
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,880
at any time

717
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,840
and

718
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,320
i am speaking so i cannot be on mute

719
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,080
learn to forgive and you know people are

720
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,840
very forgiving because they understand

721
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,640
because they are on the same

722
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,320
side of the table

723
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,120
so

724
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,279
don't be hard on yourself because you

725
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,919
are here for a spark journey and we are

726
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,880
all here to spark our as well as others

727
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,840
journey

728
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,679
small small things making big

729
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,679
differences

730
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,720
manifesting your executive presence and

731
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,960
you can master that those

732
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,159
too

733
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,960
which makes people think that you are an

734
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,720
important person

735
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,679
but

736
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,679
for anybody else to believe that you are

737
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,159
important you got to believe it yourself

738
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,399
and how do you do this the small things

739
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,960
small small changes in daily routine it

740
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,520
becomes a habit and

741
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,080
like throw situation in you which are

742
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,679
which requires high stake communication

743
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,240
you are prepared with your executive

744
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,880
presence and people will choose you they

745
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,760
will trust you that this is the person i

746
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,240
can trust at difficult situation this

747
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,679
person will take me out from the

748
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,000
difficult situation

749
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,120
and

750
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,799
i think

751
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,679
when we talk about nelson mandela he was

752
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,760
somebody

753
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,600
who had this

754
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,440
somebody with warmth

755
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,919
credibility confidence

756
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,320
he radiated everything that is why

757
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,760
people believed him very easily

758
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,200
i don't want to be mean but

759
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,360
being a hillary clinton clinton

760
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,960
in a pan suit does you no good

761
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,320
so

762
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,720
you choose you want to be the sheryl

763
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,200
sandberg michelle obama

764
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,440
or someone like hillary clinton i am

765
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,240
sorry but yes it is what it is let's

766
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,240
embrace it

767
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,640
so yes that was my time

768
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,679
uh

769
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:08,520
looking forward to questions if any

770
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,799
back great presentation shaka thank you

771
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,799
very very much

772
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,159
i was taking some notes here

773
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,520
right at the start calen mentioned that

774
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,919
storytelling is such an important art

775
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,240
and i think it's one that's

776
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,640
it's getting a little more uh

777
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,200
highlights nowadays

778
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,080
but

779
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,480
it's still very much overlooked can you

780
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,279
talk about that a little bit

781
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:44,399
yes

782
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:45,679
so

783
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,240
when we talk about storytelling

784
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,760
that is something which is very

785
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,880
important

786
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,919
why

787
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,799
because that shows how authentic you are

788
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,519
you might have a lot of content when

789
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,279
you're talking giving a motivational

790
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,159
speak speech in particular but you don't

791
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,399
bring at that element of your own

792
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,279
journey how do people rely

793
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,600
on you how do people believe that you

794
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,519
are an important person the right person

795
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,880
to go to

796
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,279
you got to bring in that empathy factor

797
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,760
and that is what even cheryl sandberg

798
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,640
does

799
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,399
her ted talk

800
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:21,760
was the most

801
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,799
uh

802
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,279
heard that talk that year why because

803
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,120
she shared her chose to share her own

804
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,000
story and her story makes

805
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,840
her

806
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,159
powerful so yes storytelling is very

807
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,120
important and also it helps people

808
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,600
comprehend what you're trying to say

809
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,559
imagine

810
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:43,360
your client not understanding anything

811
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,000
about infosec the best way you can teach

812
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,640
him is through stories

813
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,440
so

814
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,360
it is an art

815
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,039
which has to be manifested when you are

816
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,120
talking about executive presence because

817
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,120
even as a technical person you got to

818
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,200
know how to break it down into small

819
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,480
simple stories to convert a deal see how

820
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,360
important it is

821
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,399
yes it is very important

822
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:12,840
uh let me see there was another one here

823
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,360
from laura laura fish

824
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,240
she was mentioning something about

825
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,039
having a rest beef face

826
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,440
and how that stuff and how we must

827
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,279
practice for uh presentations

828
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,519
me and

829
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,399
angelina gave her some points but

830
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:35,679
from

831
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,919
what you've done from where you've been

832
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,240
what would you

833
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,120
suggest to people who want to practice

834
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,799
the presentations

835
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:48,960
and have no idea where even to look for

836
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,840
yes very important question and a very

837
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,480
good question thank you

838
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,120
so when you are there to present about

839
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,159
something don't worry about the graphics

840
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:01,360
and all

841
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,360
be focused on the content

842
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,480
have an

843
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,200
practice to write down the content and

844
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,000
also learn to outline your content even

845
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,480
if it is a 10 pager content

846
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,360
learn the art of making outlines because

847
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,200
you know what those outlines will make

848
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,480
you help you make the ppts

849
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,960
and regarding making powerful colorful

850
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,360
ppt have a sense of the color wheel and

851
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,559
you will get help from the internet

852
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,279
so and how to present

853
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:34,159
so i'll talk tell you about my story

854
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:37,279
i was not a very outspoken person i used

855
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,120
to be a shy person

856
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,360
when i came to ibm

857
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,440
i used to do photography for ibm wise

858
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,559
until and

859
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,840
until my mentors they asked me to start

860
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,519
teaching to people and one of my friends

861
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,919
she preaches that the best way to learn

862
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,320
something is to start teaching it

863
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,320
the moment you start teaching

864
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,200
people you learn how to practice

865
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,840
and making ppt is no big deal the moment

866
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,440
you outline what your

867
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,800
your content

868
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,960
your ppt is any which way is ready

869
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,040
templates and everything can be found on

870
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,040
the internet right and

871
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,440
with practice you will master the art of

872
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,320
making beautiful colorful ppts listen to

873
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,079
talks

874
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,040
go to youtube find out people

875
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,239
who does

876
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,280
amazing with the talks and ppts

877
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,879
learn the trick of the traits with them

878
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,239
and you're good to go

879
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,280
nice

880
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,199
we have one more from allison henry

881
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,440
what are your thoughts on managing a

882
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,760
hybrid meeting with both remote and

883
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,320
in-person participants do you speak to

884
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,839
the room or to the camera

885
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,399
both

886
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:53,119
so

887
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,119
this is something

888
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,440
this is something which is a tricky

889
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,079
situation in that situation what do you

890
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,359
do

891
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,440
you place the camera

892
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,320
where in your face is projected in the

893
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,880
opposite side of your audience

894
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,599
in that case you do not have to worry

895
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,680
much about whether you're talking to the

896
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,839
audience in the camera or to the

897
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,000
audience sitting in the room as simple

898
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,359
as the sea

899
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,280
but yes the direction you have to be

900
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,480
mindful

901
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,880
also you have to be mindful

902
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,640
of the light

903
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,280
another good thing which came to my mind

904
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,520
because when you are on a camera the

905
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,520
light should be good this is executive

906
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,640
presence

907
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,040
also

908
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,079
uh

909
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,760
let's see what else

910
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,440
we have time for

911
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,800
oh we're go with time i think

912
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,160
um

913
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,520
there was this line where you you

914
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,200
mentioned about

915
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,000
virtual backgrounds

916
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,760
yeah look at it

917
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,520
yeah how powerful it looks right

918
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,400
yeah

919
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,240
my case at least

920
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,880
is that the way i set up my home office

921
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,440
here i don't have anything in the

922
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,440
background i have a blank white wall so

923
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,160
i ended up thinking it would be better

924
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,240
to highlight

925
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,280
movements i'm part of that i advocate

926
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,200
for to help spread the word and

927
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,440
the the logos of the the events i'm

928
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,320
doing currently so sometimes i have only

929
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,040
these two sometimes i have one two three

930
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,480
each side

931
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,760
but

932
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,400
it's it's kind of different from

933
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,040
where you are right now i don't have a

934
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,000
nice

935
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,280
uh painting on the back i don't have a

936
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,400
place to put some books

937
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,839
but that's okay

938
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,599

939

946
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,359
background looked really beautiful and

947
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,400
powerful and it it spoke

964
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,280
i think that was that from the chat

965
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,040
let's

966
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,079
let's see there was one uh

967
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,000
roofie come off

968
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
saying that storytelling is easier is

969
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,200
the easier way to connect with people

970
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,439
right

971
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,480
ronnie will i am just

972
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,760
sorry go on yeah i am allergic to makeup

973
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,839
is it really that important to execute a

974
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:35,280
aha very beautiful question

975
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,400
no

976
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,240
you don't have to wear makeup who said

977
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,520
that you have to

978
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,560
i do because it it helps me although i

979
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,119
have a very sensitive skin so i cannot

980
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,280
wear a lot of makeup this is my natural

981
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,240
skin which is very oily so what i do i

982
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,160
put on a loud lipstick it works for me

983
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,760
eyeliner and mascara it works for me i'm

984
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,040
good to go so makeup is not that

985
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,359
important because your personality is it

986
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:02,640
speaks for you

987
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,119
in my case a loud lipstick works does

988
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,640
the talking for me

989
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,480
in your case

990
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,480
it might be something else

991
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,880
where confidence that is most important

992
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,760
not makeup because whatever you feel

993
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,480
right or good at or comfortable with and

994
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,160
your face doesn't

995
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,320
itch or you know you don't have allergy

996
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,160
to your face

997
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,560
that is more important not

998
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,520
a plastic face so yes

999
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,960
it depends on individual

1000
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,400
okay

1001
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,800
yes that was a great question

1002
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,480
yeah

1003
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,839
um

1004
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:49,119

1005
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,079
