Security Dilemma: When Migrating to Cloud
Archana Puri

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,310
KAT: All right!

3
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,490
Welcome to our next talk.

4
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:30,538
INE learning security, action axe, MongoDB,
Juniper, of course.

5
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:31,539
Corelight.

6
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:32,539
Google.

7
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:33,539
We Hack Purple.

8
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:35,300
I love it.

9
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,300
And BridgeCrew.

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,080
We have a great talk coming up.

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,040
With a great speaker.

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:49,269
Archana, I'm very excited to hear about the
security dilemma when migrating to the cloud.

13
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,680
And I'm going keep this introduction very
short.

14
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:59,710
But Archana has almost over 9 years of experience
doing security risk in the business world.

15
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:03,670
And making all kinds of security decisions.

16
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:11,530
I'm really looking forward to hearing her
talk about the issues that happen when migrating

17
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,170
to the cloud.

18
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:19,750
So, without further ado, please take it away,
Archana.

19
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,070
ARCHANA: Thank you, Kat.

20
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,820
Good evening, everyone.

21
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,298
It is good morning in Australia.

22
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:29,350
In sunny Sydney here.

23
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:33,669
Thank you for joining me here for the talk
about Security Dilemma: When Migrating to

24
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34,670
Cloud.

25
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,060
I am Archana.

26
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,049
I have been introduced already.

27
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:45,649
Just want to give you a glimpse of my work
and talk about a little about myself.

28
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:51,509
I'm a cybersecurity adviser working into the
cybersecurity domain for almost a decade now.

29
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:56,990
I'm currently working as a security manager
for a retail organization in Sydney.

30
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,380
I'm a former biotech graduate who pursued
a masters in cybersecurity cyber laws and

31
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,630
information security and practicing the same.

32
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:12,390
I'm an advocate for the women in cybersecurity
community.

33
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:19,160
And passionate about reducing the gap of women
in the workforce within the organization and

34
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,990
continue to contribute towards it.

35
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:25,441
I'm associated with some of the associations
as you can see within Australia and the Middle

36
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:30,170
East for the same.

37
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,309
And let's quickly cover the agenda for today's
session.

38
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,630
I will be talking about key strategic drivers
for cloud migration.

39
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:43,079
And approaches for cloud migration for major
technical and security challenges.

40
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:50,500
I will then take you through the Pandora box
which I call a security dilemma that I encountered

41
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:56,400
working for the organizations towards their
migration journey.

42
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,230
Followed with some of the approaches and security
controls.

43
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:06,200
Mainly focused on the cloud native ones.

44
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,079
And then lastly, we will conclude the talk
with some of the key understandings and learnings

45
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,380
from the sessions as takeaways.

46
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:21,630
So, with the ongoing pace of adoption to cloud
technologies to scale up businesses, and especially

47
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:27,880
accelerated, you know, during the global pandemic
as we have seen with working from home requirements,

48
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:33,130
there is more than ever a requirement for
security to scale up to the business platform

49
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,549
and technology modernization.

50
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:41,820
With that said, some of the other strategy
drivers that drives companies to adopt to

51
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:50,570
the cloud, you know, apart from everybody
doing so is some of it is listed here.

52
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,620
Which pay for what you use.

53
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,030
You know, it is subscription based.

54
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,560
So, you basically pay while you use it.

55
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:03,040
Use a resource within cloud and then once
you are done with it, discard it and you don't

56
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,060
pay for it anymore.

57
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,990
So, it's kind of cost effective.

58
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:07,990
Quick time to market.

59
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:13,620
You know, businesses are adopting and, you
know, releasing their services day in and

60
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,760
day out.

61
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:21,219
To meet that demand they need a scalable,
reliable platform as well.

62
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,919
So, that's one of the drivers for them to
migrate to cloud.

63
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:26,919
Next is scalability.

64
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:29,380
I have touched a little bit upon it.

65
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,509
You know, that with the growing number of
services, with the growing number of portfolios.

66
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:41,680
And the customer demands, the companies need
to grow in real time.

67
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:48,550
And they don't have really time to place an
order for an application, servers, storages

68
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,990
and stuff.

69
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,759
And they need to meet the scalability demands
in real time.

70
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:57,460
Compliance to security and privacy guidelines.

71
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:02,109
Like we all know, cloud service providers,
Google, Amazon, Microsoft.

72
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:09,830
They're kind of compliant with a lot of, you
know, regional, global security privacy guidelines.

73
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:15,060
And adopting to their services, you know,
helps companies transfer those privacy and

74
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,060
security obligations.

75
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:24,580
Or any other, you know, regional laws and
obligations to share with the cloud service

76
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,580
providers.

77
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:32,020
And hence, you know, they move their workloads
to cloud as well as a motivation.

78
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,020
Mobility.

79
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:38,099
Basically, access to the systems from anywhere,
any time and from any system.

80
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:45,020
Not to explain further that this has been
kind of, you know, a key driver during the

81
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,020
pandemic as well.

82
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,219
That people have been working from home, from
anywhere.

83
00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:51,289
From any device.

84
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:56,009
And so, I just want to take you through some
of the stats here.

85
00:05:56,009 --> 00:06:01,550
You know, most of the companies start their
journey with these goals in place as we have

86
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,430
discussed I call it drivers in place.

87
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:10,430
However, as they progress, they realized that
it takes longer than what they thought for

88
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,419
their cloud migration to happen.

89
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:20,639
Because of scope creep, budget overrun, longer
timeline, unmanaged resources and there are

90
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,099
many other reasons, you know, for that lag
time.

91
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:29,800
I would say, you know, the journey with the
ambition of having an adjoined mobile and

92
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,639
scalable work place works quite well for a
startup which are starting their whole footprint

93
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,809
within cloud.

94
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:41,479
Or it is comparatively easier for small to
medium businesses because of less complexity

95
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:42,889
within their environment.

96
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:48,590
However, you know, for some this could be
debatable too.

97
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,489
But they're less complex than heavier organizations.

98
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:59,539
Because none of these compares to a well established
large organization hosting critical legacy

99
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:00,539
systems.

100
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:04,590
And they have many dependencies and tentacles
spread across the infrastructure.

101
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:11,369
And then they plan to lift and ship this heavy
load to the cloud.

102
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,310
You know?

103
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:17,070
The migration tends to fail if it is not done
with the right approach.

104
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:26,599
And some of the facts here, you know, that
I've presented, the 68%, 73% and 62% here

105
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:33,569
are some of the stories which are, you know,
talking about some of those cloud journeys

106
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:35,909
which have gone south.

107
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:41,909
And then as you would appreciate that we have
been just talking about some of the challenges.

108
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:46,839
We have not even touched upon the security
which may cause another level of concern and

109
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,809
nightmare during the migration.

110
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:53,199
So, in the following slides, I just wanted
to set a baseline.

111
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:59,999
And in the following slides, we will be touching
through some of the security and technology

112
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,999
challenges.

113
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:07,940
And then but that doesn't mean, you know,
there is that we can't get the cloud migration

114
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,960
working right.

115
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,849
All that is required is the right people,
right approach and the right controls for

116
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:16,628
the migration for it to try it within cloud.

117
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:21,939
Let's look at some of the migration approaches
here which have been standardized and classified

118
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:28,680
into six categories based on the approach.

119
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:37,200
You can see this is a well known, you know,
diagram for demonstrating these 5R, 6R approaches

120
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,710
for cloud migration.

121
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:46,180
So, while planning the migration, you know,
and just to start from the scratch, when planning

122
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:51,800
the migration, it is important to perform
the code for your planning and discovery exercise.

123
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:57,810
This means that the company should first identify
applications that they want to migrate.

124
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,859
Prioritize which ones to move first.

125
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:05,360
You know, depending on the overall architecture,
the complexities because of the interdependencies.

126
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,600
Licensing arrangements and many more.

127
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,459
Ideas and straightforward approach.

128
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:15,699
It is always a good idea for companies to
starts with lower complexities, like service

129
00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:16,699
oriented applications.

130
00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:26,839
As a quick thing to open a path with good
learns experience for migrating rather complex

131
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:30,640
systems later.

132
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,100
The identification and prioritization for
migration should not be a one time activity.

133
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:44,230
This should be, you know, a living and breathing
approach or this should be a living and breathing

134
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,920
activity, rather.

135
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,170
To be able to accommodate any if the project
requires so.

136
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:57,160
And then now that we have set the baseline
that, you know, there is migration that is

137
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:03,540
going to happen, I just want to quickly take
you through these six approaches and let you

138
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,160
know what these are.

139
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,529
So, that's starting with the re hosting which
is lift and shift.

140
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:16,100
This approach involves, you know, just lifting
the application from your data center and

141
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,540
moving it to another's data center, which
is cloud.

142
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:25,459
And just rehosting without doing any architectural
changes.

143
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:28,329
So, why companies do so?

144
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:34,109
Because, you know, most of them, they estimate
some level of benefit, you know, of rehosting

145
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,279
these applications to the cloud.

146
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:38,860
Next comes replatforming.

147
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,009
It's the yellow color here.

148
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:43,569
Not sure if that's too visible.

149
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:46,990
So, replatforming is an optimization approach.

150
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:50,240
After mostly adopted after lift and shift.

151
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:56,020
Where, you know, the companies utilize cloud
native capabilities to meet the functional

152
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,020
requirements.

153
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:05,100
So, for example, you are replacing your on
premise database with an Amazon RDS relation

154
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,000
database there.

155
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,631
Or similar capabilities that is provided by
some other cloud native capabilities with

156
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,180
the cloud you're moving.

157
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:25,180
Refactoring or rearchitecting involves writing
the application from scratch.

158
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:30,510
And then just to have more automation, more
agility, improve resiliency and be able to

159
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:37,870
utilize that cloud cloud technology more to
achieve the drivers and goals that we saw

160
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,960
in the initial place.

161
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,860
Next comes repurchasing.

162
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,860
In orange here.

163
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:49,840
Which is, you know, it's simple that you repurchase
the application that you want to migrate.

164
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:55,260
So, for example, you know, well knowns are
migrating the CRM systems.

165
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:59,569
Which was here, and you are using one frame
to save spots.

166
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:07,400
Or an HR system to work and there are many
more.

167
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:12,600
Next comes here in the grays, there are these
two in gray that you see here, retire and

168
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,600
retain.

169
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,970
So, during the application migration, companies
may come across to the applications or features

170
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:22,529
that are no longer required and can be retired.

171
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:24,230
And then the other one is retain.

172
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:31,519
Which includes the set of applications not
prioritized for migration because it is not

173
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,740
aligned with the goals of migration at this
time.

174
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,740
However, it can be considered later.

175
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:45,100
So, as we've looked at all these migration
scenarios, I just want to concentrate, you

176
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:50,540
know, a bit on and grab your attention on
the three migration approach, rehosting, replatforming

177
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:58,329
and refactoring as it will form the basis
to understand the scenario that we're gonna

178
00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:00,750
talk about in the further slides.

179
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:08,600
So, let's look at lift and shift or rehosting
and understand some of the complexities that

180
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,730
that comes part of it.

181
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:16,139
You know, as I mentioned, you know, it is
a widely adopted approach for migrating critical

182
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:18,420
and legacy applications to cloud.

183
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:25,269
When commercial off the shelf applications
are migrated using lift and shift, the limitations

184
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:33,329
of applications such as lack of scalability,
integrations and other, you know, flexible

185
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:38,920
opportunities that the cloud service provides,
you know, you tend to resist it.

186
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,870
Or it is not really compatible with it.

187
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:49,700
And also, with the lift and shift, you know,
you've retained those network complexities

188
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,980
within your network because you just are lifting
and shifting the applications to cloud.

189
00:13:53,980 --> 00:14:01,840
However, you may regain some of that connectivity
with the online and others that the application

190
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,610
depends on.

191
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,030
As I mentioned, dependent applications and
databases.

192
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:15,170
You retain those connectivity with your on
premise system to have those dependent applications

193
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,170
and it's easier to run.

194
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:22,029
Because you don't want to compromise on the
overall architecture or the availability of

195
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:26,350
that particular application that you're dependent
on.

196
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:36,670
Hence what happens is with its limitation,
you know, it is it the companies have limited

197
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,099
utilization of cloud resources.

198
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:46,921
And hence, you know, resulting in a long time
long term failure if, you know, they tend

199
00:14:46,921 --> 00:14:54,139
to find it going over budget, you know, running
over time on the project timelines.

200
00:14:54,139 --> 00:14:58,129
And it requires capabilities and skills.

201
00:14:58,129 --> 00:14:59,129
You know?

202
00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:03,819
However not as much as the other approaches.

203
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,670
Next step.

204
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,519
So, replatforming.

205
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,220
So, as we covered before, it is the next step
to lift and shift.

206
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,880
You know, it is mostly an optimization approach.

207
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,110
By using cloud native capabilities.

208
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,990
It requires specialized skills.

209
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:23,660
Hence, it is a bit time consuming.

210
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,040
Understanding, learning those skills.

211
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,339
Testing those skills.

212
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:33,620
Since as I mentioned, it requires more specialized
skills, there are increased chances of errors

213
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,699
and mis configurations.

214
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:41,109
However, if it is configured properly, it
provide increased resilience because you're

215
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,579
utilizing more cloud native services.

216
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:50,300
It enables long term cost saving which is
one of the goals as we saw and one of the

217
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,279
drivers for moving to cloud.

218
00:15:52,279 --> 00:16:01,879
And it enables adaptability and the ability
to respond quickly to changes within your

219
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:02,879
organization.

220
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,370
The last one is refactoring.

221
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,839
Which is rewriting the application from scratch.

222
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:15,389
It also uses the cloud native capabilities
and other, you know, other capabilities as

223
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:16,389
well.

224
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:18,320
Automation is basically the foundation here.

225
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,750
So, you know, the code is the basis.

226
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:29,431
Hence, you know, you need more specialized
skills, you know, to be able to automate all

227
00:16:29,431 --> 00:16:34,670
your requirements from the technical and security
aspect.

228
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:39,319
However, from the security aspect, we'll look
a bit later too.

229
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:45,760
And then since it requires specialized skills
with the migrations that are happening adopting

230
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:51,000
such approaches, you know, tend to end up
in this configurations, you know, unintentional

231
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
errors.

232
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,319
However, you know, ifs it done properly, the
migration provides, it's kind of most cost

233
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:01,050
effective.

234
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:11,149
And, you know, it is really adaptable and
provides a good amount of or it's it provides

235
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:14,260
effective change management as well.

236
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:20,699
So, now that I've covered the migration approach
and its complexity, I just you must have been

237
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:24,270
wondering where is security among all of these
exercises?

238
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:29,389
I want to take you through some of the common
security challenges encountered during the

239
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,620
migration work.

240
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:37,959
As you can see, I highlighted after one with
a meme that I've taken from Google.

241
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:46,110
So, which is which is in itself a nightmare
for a lot of project managers and technology

242
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,110
team.

243
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,178
Okay, you plan for the migration.

244
00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:51,590
But you forgot to engage security there.

245
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:56,880
After all, the hard work is done around, you
know, defining the migration approach, migration

246
00:17:56,881 --> 00:18:01,830
drivers and then here you call security and
security comes and says, oh, it's just don't

247
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,110
go there.

248
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,678
Well, let's look at some of the security challenges.

249
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:07,890
One is defined here.

250
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,429
Let's look at the other ones.

251
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:11,540
I call them security dilemma.

252
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:16,300
And hence the talk comes into picture.

253
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:20,529
So, the dilemma, we'll just cover one by one.

254
00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:26,020
The first and foremost and the most important,
as I see, you know, for establishing the baseline

255
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:31,559
for any security program or, you know, just
understanding what security control is required.

256
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:32,649
You need visibility.

257
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:36,270
So, it simply is, you know, what you can't
see.

258
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,200
You really can't protect.

259
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:43,990
And so, security office faces challenge with
respect to, you know, asset mapping within

260
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:49,779
cloud because of its dynamic nature of the
instances, changing IPs.

261
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:52,770
Complexity of the architecture, mapping accesses.

262
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:53,770
You know?

263
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:57,340
And managing changes within cloud.

264
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:03,179
Data flow, you know, if you don't know what
data flow is, what's the classification of

265
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,180
it?

266
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:08,880
It gets difficult to put those controls in
place.

267
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,130
The next one comes keeping up with the rapid
changes.

268
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:16,540
It's, again, like we've covered this before.

269
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:22,760
That the companies were adopting the cloud
technology need that engineering and flexibility

270
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:27,710
to be able to develop and release these services
on demand.

271
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:33,049
But from the security aspect, the traditional
checklist based controls, you know, that we

272
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:38,279
have in place for our data center on premise
systems for security assurance, before any

273
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:44,130
release of these services to production are
not really sufficient here.

274
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:49,429
This is what happens is like these services
are released without, you know, appropriate

275
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:50,470
security checks.

276
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:57,660
Leaving the low hanging fruits for the adversities
to gain access within your system.

277
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:01,600
Next comes the inconsistent security policy
and governance controls.

278
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,500
So, of course, you know, it all is kind of
interlinked, you know, as we are thinking

279
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,030
through it one by one.

280
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:14,100
But inconsistent security policies and controls
here means that for your data center, you

281
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:21,360
know, once you define a security policy or
lay down those security controls and governance

282
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:27,080
processes, it is based off a certain risk
risk assessment approach.

283
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:32,090
You define those risk, you know, you understand
the risk exposure of your data center.

284
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:38,799
Why you're moving to the cloud with other
challenges in place and while, you know, the

285
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,270
migration approaches that are adopted.

286
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:45,040
The right view of the security risk is not
identified.

287
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:54,460
And then hence, you know, the applicability
of these controls and security guidelines

288
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:59,760
becomes a challenge for security teams or
security architects to basically, you know,

289
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:06,230
move these or make these controls happen to
be capable within cloud.

290
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:11,200
Next one is the dependency on traditional
security controls.

291
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,530
We covered some of that in, you know, keeping
up with the rapid changes.

292
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:20,529
However, you know, as I mentioned before point
in time risk assessment is almost impossible

293
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,610
due to the growing number of internal and
external services.

294
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:26,280
Dependency, run time.

295
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,170
Makes polyglot software development adopted.

296
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:35,980
And thus it forced, you know, companies to
make a tradeoff between speed and security

297
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:40,559
and exposing the organizations to unnecessary
risk.

298
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:41,950
Next is mis configuration.

299
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:48,690
You know, of course, like with the adoption
requires some level of skills and then, you

300
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,420
know, the lack of skills.

301
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:55,649
Or the negligence within the cloud because
you're spinning the systems day in and day

302
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:56,649
out.

303
00:21:56,649 --> 00:22:01,689
Bringing down the systems day in and day out,
the mis configurations tend to happen and

304
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:08,539
which leaves significant loopholes and it's
hard for security architects or security teams

305
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:13,640
to manage this level of, you know, mis configurations.

306
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:22,260
And the linked another dilemma in the configuration
is lack of adequate monitoring and incident

307
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,260
response.

308
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:29,879
So basically, you don't know what systems
are existing out in within cloud.

309
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,490
What services have you procured?

310
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:36,289
Since, you know, not much visibility is there
within within the environment.

311
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:43,039
And hence, you know, maybe the logs are not
enabled, or the monitoring is not appropriately

312
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,039
configured.

313
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:50,140
And hence, you know, if there is any event
or incidents happening within those instances,

314
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,870
it just goes unnoticed.

315
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,939
Last, but certainly not the least is the access
control.

316
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:01,130
Along with, you know, everything else that
we have been seeing.

317
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,790
You know, access control tend to be a mess.

318
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:07,520
You don't know what privileges are assigned
to which users.

319
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,529
Although, you know, the cloud technologies
provide the level to develop these access

320
00:23:12,529 --> 00:23:13,529
controls.

321
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:19,620
However, the configuration becomes a challenge
without, you know, visibility, without understanding

322
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,658
who needs access to what.

323
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:26,130
And practicing those least privileged need
to know, you know, becomes a challenge.

324
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:33,909
So, now that we have looked at, you know,
all the security challenges there, I want

325
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:39,309
to take you to the migration scenario here
which is proposed to lift and shift the critical

326
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:43,299
application from data center from cloud.

327
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:48,059
The objective for this migration was to scale
the existing application to enhance its performance

328
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:54,280
and capacity in cloud with deploying number
of, you know, services for the portfolio for

329
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,280
the organization.

330
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,790
To understand the problem better, let's consider
that the set of applications which are hosted

331
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:04,940
here in the data center are critical customer
facing applications.

332
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:08,890
And due to the criticality, the migration
was required to be done with minimum overall

333
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:09,990
change to the architecture.

334
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:16,070
However, to achieve this scalability and enhance
the performance of the application, it was

335
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:22,029
important to consider replatforming and refactoring
some of the, you know, associated applications

336
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:25,039
and the components.

337
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:30,770
Hence while lift and shift resulted with better,
you know, retaining some of the data center

338
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:39,240
ingress/egress traffic by a compromised, you
know, security protection systems like firewalls,

339
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,100
load balancers and all.

340
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:47,590
The migration architecture and roadmap also
included optimizing the application and dependent

341
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:50,679
integration by leveraging cloud native capabilities.

342
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:57,770
And later on, the refactoring of, you know,
to enhance the functionality and overall performance.

343
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:03,799
So, as you see in the architecture here, you
know, the security challenges that we have

344
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:07,168
discovered before seems quite valid and inevitable.

345
00:25:07,169 --> 00:25:12,760
But the irony here is that this is just the
tip of the iceberg.

346
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,600
Showing that I've tried putting together.

347
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:21,260
The actual architecture actually looked way
better and way complicated than this.

348
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:27,450
So, now that we looked at the security challenges
in such architecture and such migration work,

349
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:35,861
I will take you through the approach by using
secure by design principles whereas security

350
00:25:35,861 --> 00:25:41,200
architects are or security professionals we
can work with business teams which are planning

351
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:47,410
to migrate to cloud and make it easier from
the security aspect.

352
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:54,310
The first step starts with security teams
doing this early on within your project.

353
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,408
Not being the late comers.

354
00:25:56,409 --> 00:26:02,130
It is important for business and technical
teams to bring in security at an early stage.

355
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:07,820
Which will ensure a clear understanding of
the migration drivers and align the strategy

356
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,379
goals with the overall goal.

357
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:18,179
What it will do is facilitate better communication
and collaboration as well with development

358
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:19,179
teams.

359
00:26:19,179 --> 00:26:24,670
Where security teams will be able to identify
the scope and work with the solution architects

360
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:28,409
to understand the conceptual and retail design.

361
00:26:28,409 --> 00:26:33,830
And roadmap for the migration, which will
lay the grounds for the security team to perform

362
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:37,270
appropriate profiling and assess the risk
to the applications and platforms.

363
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:46,039
And then, you know, identify the adequate
control applicability within your cloud migration,

364
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:50,240
you know, while you're migrating or, you know,
in the process of migration.

365
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,590
Or post migration, you know, control applicability.

366
00:26:55,590 --> 00:27:00,830
This would then be defined, you know, for
the security architects or security professionals

367
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:03,519
engaged in the cloud migration work.

368
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:09,310
The work would be to define these control
baselines and the risk assessment that you

369
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,350
had before.

370
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:17,230
And define and measure those guardrails and
measure the effect of security and define

371
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:21,769
the matrices and these periodic matrices.

372
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:29,730
Now, how you will achieve all of these controls
and then control assurance around your cloud

373
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:36,799
workflows is to keep optimizing and improving
by adopting cloud native solutions and capabilities

374
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:45,408
and then optimizing configurations and embedding
security into the DevOps cycle to avoid much

375
00:27:45,409 --> 00:27:47,539
of the manual intervention here.

376
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:50,470
And then have it as automated as possible.

377
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:56,471
So, from next slide onwards here, I want to
concentrate on some of and I want to showcase

378
00:27:56,471 --> 00:28:01,890
some of the cloud native controls to achieve,
you know, the approach that we have worked

379
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,500
through here.

380
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:12,720
And so, one of the security controls and the
basic one is to have, you know, visibility

381
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:18,029
and, you know, just to resolve the challenge
that we saw to mitigate the lack of visibility

382
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,029
there.

383
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:23,169
To perform the adequate risk profiling and
identification.

384
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:34,350
So, the example shown here is basically, you
know, is related to a asset tagging and providing

385
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:42,059
the asset tagging and having the CMD of your
asset which involves controlling the owner,

386
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:45,590
team, life cycle, policies and environment.

387
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:51,980
So, the example which is demonstrated here
is the automated asset tagging which consists

388
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,630
of, you know, as you can see the lambda function
here.

389
00:28:55,630 --> 00:29:02,850
Which captures the API events, you know, if
there is, say, a new EC2 instance that's created

390
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:06,178
as part of the auto scaling functionality.

391
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:15,940
It will capture the capture the traffic and
then analyze, you know, and create the tag

392
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:21,570
using the owner's value of the username and
the EC2.

393
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:27,389
And then provide C tagging for that EC2 instance
as part of the auto scaling group.

394
00:29:27,389 --> 00:29:33,439
Once you've tagged the instance for us as
security professionals to be able to monitor

395
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:40,139
these assets as these are being created, it
gets easier to keep track of the overall data

396
00:29:40,139 --> 00:29:49,428
flow and then hence identify the at risk exposure
level of these instances in real time.

397
00:29:49,429 --> 00:29:54,429
So, this is the basic one which where you
can leverage the Cloud Native capabilities

398
00:29:54,429 --> 00:30:03,360
to be able to tag those assets and identify
and get the visibility of your cloud infrastructure.

399
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,620
Similar to that, next one that I want to show
as I mentioned about laying the guardrails

400
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:13,860
and, you know, defining the minimum security
requirements within the cloud.

401
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:19,668
And then achieving those and keeping track
of those with the adequate automation.

402
00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:26,260
I tried showing the example here of, you know,
just just with the configuration changes,

403
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,408
for example.

404
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:34,870
Where if if any configuration changes in any
of your workload, there's this big AWS config

405
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:39,199
which monitors the configuration that you
have enabled.

406
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,450
Which monitors those configuration compliance
within your workloads.

407
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:51,669
Amazon, the IDS intrusion detection system
that picks up all the logs and then provides

408
00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:53,289
the behavioral analysis.

409
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:59,929
So, these basically, these pick up the logs
from particular resources.

410
00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:05,260
For example, when this configuration has happened
and would provide you, if you have configured

411
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:11,260
just for detection, would provide you the
notification that here's something here your

412
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:17,260
workload is misconfigured or is not compliant
to the security guardrails that you have defined.

413
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,480
Please have a look at it.

414
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:26,639
Or if you have any lambda functions and custom
prevention rules there, then, of course, it

415
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:32,620
will prevent or it will revert the configuration
back to, you know, what it was supposed to

416
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,100
be and provide you with the notifications.

417
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:43,340
Moving forward is, you know, one of the one
of the most important controls.

418
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:46,120
You know, having this segmented network architecture.

419
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:52,300
So, basically, you know, create the critical
instances in separate accounts.

420
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:57,678
Don't have them all hosted within one account.

421
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:58,679
You know, segregate those.

422
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:05,300
So, you know, for example, out of this picture,
an example, if you want all your logs to be

423
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:11,340
collected from your cloud instances within
an S3 bucket, you wouldn't want that S3 bucket,

424
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,159
you know, to be accessible to everybody.

425
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:19,899
So, you would want that S3 bucket to be hosted
in a specialized, you know, account.

426
00:32:19,899 --> 00:32:25,418
In a segregated environment which is, you
know, accessible to the least people as possible.

427
00:32:25,419 --> 00:32:31,300
Or, you know, you have more controls over
it.

428
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:35,220
Next one is implementing least privilege network.

429
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:43,309
So, what I've shown, I've tried showcasing
here is, you know, you can adopt some of the

430
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:50,139
cloud technologies such as, you know, having
security groups, having network ACLs to segregate

431
00:32:50,139 --> 00:32:56,709
and, you know, control the network ingress
and egress traffic movement between two instances.

432
00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:04,670
So, as an example here, I tried showcasing
that how using, you know, the firewalls, the

433
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:05,670
transit gateways.

434
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,970
These are Cloud Native solutions for Amazon
Web Services.

435
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:13,840
You know, you can segregate the traffic and
control the traffic between two virtual private

436
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,428
clouds or different accounts.

437
00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:21,309
Maybe hosted in different regions or, you
know, you can control those with the CPL within

438
00:33:21,309 --> 00:33:23,740
the same region as well.

439
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:28,860
Just to control that network traffic and,
you know, reduce the overall risk surface.

440
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:38,189
So, in lines with that, like I've demonstrated
a lot of security solutions, you know, which

441
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:46,169
are Cloud Native and some of these I just
want to highlight, you know, as is that some

442
00:33:46,169 --> 00:33:50,789
of the shared security capabilities that are
available within your cloud service provider.

443
00:33:50,789 --> 00:33:54,370
I have taken an example of Amazon Web Services
here.

444
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:59,649
But the similar capabilities are provided
by other cloud service providers as well.

445
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:05,970
So, some of these common security capabilities
are federated IAM, logging and monitoring,

446
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:10,090
incident response, key management there will
be many more.

447
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:20,830
I have showcased AWS config as a capability
to take an example of continuously monitoring

448
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,449
the configuration compliances.

449
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:28,158
You know, which is monitored through AWS config
if that is enabled.

450
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,320
And then you get notified as we have seen
in the slides as well.

451
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:39,219
So, some of the some of the key takeaways
from this session as we are wrapping it up

452
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:42,178
is, you know, having the right management
oversight.

453
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:43,649
Because they are the decision makers.

454
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:50,770
And, you know, aligning the security intentions
and security objectives during the migration.

455
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:57,500
Or while planning the migration with the overall
business objectives comes a long way because

456
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:03,600
you basically protect, secure, or are working
towards enabling your business.

457
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,240
Setting the right security guardrails.

458
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:10,959
You set them off of the risk appetite and
risk assessment.

459
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:19,920
By understanding the approach and understanding
what you're adopting within the cloud by migration.

460
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,720
The other one is automation like going forward,
you know, as you adopt.

461
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,118
Enhance your skills.

462
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:28,270
You know, keep automating these controls.

463
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:33,509
Because within the cloud with the rapid changes,
of course, it is difficult to keep track of

464
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:38,790
everything with a traditional, you know, security
methodologies.

465
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:45,580
Then, you know, developing and enhancing these
skills and capabilities with the continuous,

466
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:48,180
you know, cloud continue continuous capabilities.

467
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:56,720
It is important to have those capabilities
and have a team which is understanding of

468
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:01,750
the security controls and how to achieve them
through the automations and capabilities that

469
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:08,600
are available with the cloud platform that
your companies plan to adopt to.

470
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,630
Security should be in the DevOps cycle.

471
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:16,270
DevOps, DevSecOps, it's just part of it.

472
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:19,780
It comes to the automation as well.

473
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:23,390
So, security is embedded in your CI/CD pipeline,
basically.

474
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,720
You know, everything is developed.

475
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,470
Everything is checked in real time.

476
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:32,000
So, it doesn't have to be a point in time
exercise.

477
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,950
And the last one is that security is standardized
across the asset lifecycle.

478
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:38,669
So, once it is accepted.

479
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,750
We saw the asset tagging.

480
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:45,040
You know, you create an asset and let us decommission.

481
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,040
You know, you have the security built and
you're managing it well.

482
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,560
You have the right visibility to it.

483
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,770
So, with that, you know, this concludes my
presentation into the challenges that are

484
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:04,060
faced by security architects while you're
working with your teams in their cloud migration

485
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,060
journey.

486
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:12,730
I did a paper on this topic as I'm consolidating
and making it more detailed, it will be available

487
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,170
by September.

488
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:18,270
And then at the end, I just to want to say
thank you for attending my talk.

489
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:21,060
You have my LinkedIn and email here.

490
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,110
I will be available on Slack as well.

491
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,960
And I'm ready to take any questions now.

492
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,530
KAT: Thank you so much, Archana.

493
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:32,410
That was awesome.

494
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:35,089
I learned a lot there.

495
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:38,090
I am a cloud person.

496
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:41,150
And that gave me some things to think about.

497
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:45,930
We do have a question here.

498
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:52,299
Do you have any recommendations for getting
DevSecOps and DevOps working toward the same

499
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,829
goals and working better together?

500
00:37:55,829 --> 00:37:58,099
ARCHANA: Yes.

501
00:37:58,099 --> 00:38:05,329
So, you know, the answer answer basically
lies in the question that, you know, you both

502
00:38:05,329 --> 00:38:10,020
the DevOps and DevSecOps are working to achieve
the same goal.

503
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,560
That is the business objective.

504
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:17,470
If it is for moving to cloud or operating
in cloud and retaining that cloud environment.

505
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:23,839
So, you know, when you're working towards
the same objective and the challenge basically

506
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:29,380
comes because security is adopting certain
guidelines and checklist based approaches.

507
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:35,500
So, when they tend to understand how developers
are working, how developers are developing

508
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:41,230
those codes, it is easier to embed those security
tests, automated tests, you know, as part

509
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,650
of your development cycle.

510
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:50,000
And embedding those security checks, you know,
as part of those CI/CD pipelines that DevOps

511
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:56,520
is working towards and making sure that, you
know, your security isn't built in the part

512
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:01,970
of any solution that is being released, you
know, out there for customers to utilize.

513
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:03,859
I hope that answers.

514
00:39:03,859 --> 00:39:08,369
KAT: I'm gonna throw out my own question.

515
00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:09,640
ARCHANA: Yes.

516
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:20,098
KAT: I work a lot with developers, engineers
and such that are always thinking that the

517
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:24,140
security team is just out to get them.

518
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,328
Actually.

519
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:30,380
Especially when it comes to the cloud.

520
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:35,390
Because they just don't get it that the cloud
is it's a little bit different.

521
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:38,720
But it's still just exposed computers and
so on.

522
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,720
ARCHANA: Yes.

523
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:47,060
KAT: Do you have any suggestions on getting
those engineers kind of on board?

524
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,690
Especially when you're dealing with the DevSecOps
pipeline?

525
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:55,579
How do you tend to sell security to them in
a positive way?

526
00:39:55,579 --> 00:40:03,109
ARCHANA: It is, you know, it is it all comes
down to understanding the exposure level,

527
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:08,450
you know, or risk exposure level of for that
particular goal as I mentioned that you're

528
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:09,450
working towards.

529
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:14,859
So, the developers the developers and engineers
are working to, you know, develop those capabilities

530
00:40:14,859 --> 00:40:17,890
for the organizations to utilize for their
purposes.

531
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:23,779
And if there is, you know, if the security
security architects and professional, first

532
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:29,300
of all it is important for us to not really
them.

533
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,609
And then the problem comes when we go to them.

534
00:40:32,609 --> 00:40:36,509
We go to these developers and tell them, hey,
this is a compliance obligation.

535
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:39,400
Please, you know, stick to it.

536
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,670
That's when it becomes policing.

537
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:43,170
Which is, you know, not really welcome.

538
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:45,790
So, working towards, you know, the same goal.

539
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:48,400
Achieving, you know, that particular solution.

540
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:54,780
It is important for security professionals
to talk in a risk based approach.

541
00:40:54,780 --> 00:41:01,520
And then make the engineers understand, you
know, that hey, if we do this way, certain

542
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:08,150
things I mean, this is, you know, the kind
of risk exposure that our solution might have.

543
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:11,130
And then hence, you know, we require these
minimum controls.

544
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:16,270
It may not be, you know, as restrictive as,
you know, sometime we tend to provide.

545
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:21,109
You know, it has to be catering to the business
requirement.

546
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:26,660
It has to be understanding those engineer's
point of view and yet, you know, embedding

547
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:33,348
those controls at minimum to mitigate those
risks at an acceptable level for their organization

548
00:41:33,349 --> 00:41:34,780
is, you know, an approach that works.

549
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:41,579
You know, with the engineers that I worked
with, you know, and worked with day in and

550
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:42,579
day out.

551
00:41:42,579 --> 00:41:46,760
And just understanding and focusing on that
particular risk and mitigating that to an

552
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,309
acceptable level.

553
00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:50,710
It doesn't have to be, you know, particularly
a compliance approach.

554
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:58,740
It tends to put them under the under the way
or, you know, just is diverged away from the

555
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,220
overall object.

556
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:03,529
KAT: Good point.

557
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:05,220
We have another question up here.

558
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:11,029
Do you have any particular references for
people coming up to speed on the security

559
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:13,730
tools in the different cloud environments?

560
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:17,260
ARCHANA: Let me read that question.

561
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:21,940
Do you have any particular references for
people coming up to speed on cloud tools?

562
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:22,940
Okay.

563
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,940
Yeah.

564
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:29,540
It's you know, if you're starting up as a,
you know, a security professional working

565
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:34,950
around using these cloud technologies, you
know, there are a lot of labs available out

566
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:35,950
there.

567
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:43,348
I particularly, you know, I particularly follow
a lot of AWS Cloud Native work and capabilities.

568
00:42:43,349 --> 00:42:50,290
So I, you know, if you go out to their websites
and there are a lot of trainings and, you

569
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:53,420
know, I think like classrooms.

570
00:42:53,420 --> 00:43:00,480
That, you know, you can have and leverage
these tools and work out in real time.

571
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:06,359
And then see for yourself like how these configurations
and rules are basically working within cloud.

572
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:12,819
KAT: I'll add one into that I use a lot in
various cloud environments.

573
00:43:12,819 --> 00:43:15,040
It's called ScoutSuite.

574
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,990
Open source by NCC.

575
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:25,250
And it is a great way to audit your environments,
regardless of AWS, GCP, Azure, et cetera.

576
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:29,710
And it really gives you a good overall picture
of what your environment looks like.

577
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:34,270
And if you have any settings that are misconfigured.

578
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:37,640
Which tends to be a big problem.

579
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,029
ARCHANA: Yep.

580
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:42,490
KAT: Any other questions, anybody?

581
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:45,660
Well, this was great talk.

582
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:48,960
Thank you again so much.

583
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,170
And thanks to all of our sponsors.

584
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,740
And thank you all for attending.

585
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,879
This has been a very long day.

586
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,579
But it's been a very productive day with a
lot of great talks throughout.

587
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:03,420
And just a special thanks, Archana.

588
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:08,700
Because, you know, this is I think it is the
last talk of the day, right?

589
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:12,390
I don't have the schedule in front of me,
ah, I should do that.

590
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:13,509
But is it?

591
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:15,120
ARCHANA: I think so, yes.

592
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,720
KAT: I think it is.

593
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,899
And it's always hard to be the last talk of
the day.

594
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:24,349
So, you know, I give you credit for doing
that and doing it so well.

595
00:44:24,349 --> 00:44:25,970
So, thank you very much.

596
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:26,970
Thank you all.

597
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:27,970
ARCHANA: Thank you.

598
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:31,450
KAT: And we will
ARCHANA: Thank you all for attending.

599
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:33,808
For more questions, I'm still on Slack.

600
00:44:33,809 --> 00:44:36,150
