Beyond Burnout: Hacking Your Way to a Healthier
Work Life Balance

2
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:27,769
Rachel Conejo and Lili Siri Spira
MEGAN: Good afternoon.

3
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:30,839
My name is Megan Guth and I'm featuring rated
R cofounders Lili Siri Spira and Rachel Conejo.

4
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:35,580
I would like to thank our sponsors for making
this event possible and don't forget to visit

5
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,610
the expo hall where the sponsors are.

6
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,670
There's contests and swag and community organizations
to.

7
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,500
Feedback is much appreciated.

8
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,350
The link will be posted in the chat.

9
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:56,079
Lili and Rachel created Rated R for positive
mental health.

10
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:03,199
After multiple years as investigators combing
the deep dark Internet and working with the

11
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:13,289
UC Berkeley School of law, they realized it
was applicable to sensitive online work.

12
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,950
RACHEL: Thank you very much for that beautiful
introduction, Megan.

13
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:23,350
And we are happy to share this talk with you,
Beyond Burnout: Hacking Your Way to a Healthier

14
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,009
Work Life Balance.

15
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:27,790
Without further ado, diving into it.

16
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:31,290
Today's agenda, we're going to intro the session.

17
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:41,369
Talking key concepts such as holistic security,
resilience and trauma and delve into recommended

18
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,200
strategies.

19
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,509
Since we only have 20 minutes, it's a basic
level and then direct you to our website with

20
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,450
more in depth toolkits and resources and so
on.

21
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,659
And then just end with some closing thoughts.

22
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:58,890
About further ado, I'm Rachel.

23
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,260
Lili is presenting with me.

24
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,830
We started this project to support professionals
and activists who deal with sensitive online

25
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,769
content, and we're really excited to share
what we've learned with all of you guys.

26
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:13,260
And also if you have any questions afterwards,
feel free to reach out to us on social media.

27
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,230
Our info should be in our bios.

28
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,190
But we might be putting it up at the end as
well.

29
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,190
Beautiful.

30
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:24,810
So, now about further ado Lili is going to
lead us in a brief breathing exercise to ground

31
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,330
us before the meat of our presentation.

32
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,590
LILI: Yeah.

33
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,850
Hi, everyone.

34
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,879
It's lovely to be here today.

35
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,149
Especially presenting with Rachel, one of
my cofounders of Rated R. So, I'm just going

36
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,709
guide us through a brief breathing exercise.

37
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:46,010
So, we're going to start off by sitting up
straight.

38
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,349
Shoulders back and relaxed.

39
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:50,709
You want to sort of have your spine aligned.

40
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:54,300
That helps of thinking of a string down your
spine and just pull it up like you're a doll.

41
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,239
And put your hands on your stomach.

42
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:03,010
We are going to be breathing with our diagram
which sits at the bottom of our lungs.

43
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:07,190
So, we're going to do a four, four, eight.

44
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:11,840
So, we're going to breathe in through our
nose for eight.

45
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,940
Our nose filters out all the particles from
the air.

46
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:21,732
We're going to hold for four, and breathe
out four and then eight.

47
00:03:21,732 --> 00:03:22,732
So, breathe in.

48
00:03:22,732 --> 00:03:25,590
One, two, three, four.

49
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,590
Hold.

50
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,370
One, two, three, four.

51
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,890
Breathe out.

52
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:36,950
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

53
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,220
Try it again.

54
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,370
Maybe close your eyes.

55
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,900
And make sure your stomach is expanding and
you're contracted.

56
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,000
So, breathe in.

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,790
One, two, three, four.

58
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:51,790
Hold.

59
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,280
One, two, three, four.

60
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,680
Breathe out.

61
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,269
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

62
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:07,099
And this is a breathing exercise that's really
great to do just to center yourself whenever

63
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:09,179
you're about to do anything.

64
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,430
Just when you're just about to breathe.

65
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:20,560
With this in mind, I'm going to pass it back
to Rachel to talk about why we're here today.

66
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,560
RACHEL: Perfect.

67
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,610
Well, thank you, Lili, for centering us.

68
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:27,370
And please to everyone here, remember to do
this throughout your workday as a re centering

69
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,570
whenever you're delving into a particularly
hard task.

70
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,570
Yeah.

71
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,780
So, I'm here to talk about holistic security
and why it's so important.

72
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:39,099
If you take nothing else from this presentation
today, I want you to take this concept of

73
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,639
holistic security.

74
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:48,740
From the triangle here, physical, digital,
and mental security working together.

75
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,630
And the main takeaway here, you need mental
security.

76
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,630
And you need to think about your mental security.

77
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,710
We all do.

78
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:59,500
When we are not mentally secure, we're risking
how well we're doing our job of protecting

79
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,500
other people.

80
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,960
All of us want to enter the cyber world.

81
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,690
We want to protect things digitally.

82
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:12,900
And physical and digital protection work together,
and we need to be responsible for our own

83
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:18,690
mental security in order to have the other
two types and to help others.

84
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:23,710
And so, now just kind of a brief exercise
to start thinking about how this applies to

85
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,710
our work.

86
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:29,770
Just take a moment and visualize what is one
of your main job related tasks?

87
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:34,250
So, in my case, I work as an analyst at the
Global Cyber Alliance.

88
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:39,800
One of the main things is I analyze Internet
of threat things every day and look at what

89
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,610
they use to attack Internet devices.

90
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,150
That's my task.

91
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:47,070
Think about a task you do.

92
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:51,240
And take a moment and consider the wider impact
of your work.

93
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,740
When you do this task, what is at stake?

94
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,910
For me, when I do this, my personal physical
security is at stake.

95
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:03,980
If I slip up and accidently click on a link
in one of these commands, right?

96
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,960
I could download the malware that's downloaded
on to the IoT devices on to my computer.

97
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,638
Obviously, that is very stressful.

98
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,080
What else is at stake?

99
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,099
If I don't analyze these commands and find
out where they're coming from and working

100
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:25,289
towards getting rid of the bad actors, all
of these IoT devices are at risk.

101
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:26,289
They're going to get spied on.

102
00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:31,530
And perhaps the US is at risk because the
critical infrastructure is disabled during

103
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,150
an IoT attack.

104
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:38,799
It's easy to get easy to get overwhelmed by
thinking about what's at stake.

105
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,199
That takes a toll on us.

106
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:45,310
It takes a toll on my mental health to think,
yeah, I'm doing this task that every day is

107
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,440
very routine.

108
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,210
But there is a lot at stake.

109
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,400
It takes a toll on you.

110
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:55,131
What me and Lili want to encourage you to
do is sit with the feeling and the toll these

111
00:06:55,131 --> 00:07:00,840
things take with you and work towards developing
resilience to get through it.

112
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,580
Going back to the idea of what toll does this
take on you, right?

113
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,229
This idea of trauma.

114
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:12,030
And trauma can result from experiencing a
traumatic event at work or in your personal

115
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,030
life, right?

116
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,030
So, experiencing things firsthand.

117
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:18,008
So, at work, that could look at, you know,
if there is a cyber attack that's gonna be

118
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:23,290
really traumatic or in your personal life
like, you know, say there's a death of a family

119
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,290
member.

120
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,880
That's really traumatic and you have to keep
working and keep being productive and keep

121
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,640
protecting others in the cyber sphere through
all that have.

122
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,440
That's really challenging to do.

123
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,880
There's also secondhand or vicarious trauma.

124
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,610
Empathy with another person who experienced
a traumatic event.

125
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,889
For example if you're working with the victims
of a cyber attack.

126
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:46,690
You might feel trauma even though the attack
didn't happen to you because you're working

127
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:50,509
with them, and the experiences fall on your
shoulders.

128
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:53,539
So, really start acknowledging these things.

129
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:57,930
But the good news is you can develop resilience
to these things.

130
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:04,970
Lili and I define resilience as reacting well
in the face of the traumas that we've identified

131
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,590
connected to work.

132
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:13,960
You may have heard of resilience as the ability
to adapt to cyber events and build up your

133
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,539
enterprise to protect against cyber events.

134
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:24,190
But we want you to think about your own personal
resilience as posed to mental trauma that

135
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,240
we've talked about.

136
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,490
And the main thing about resilience, it's
preventive, ideally, rather than reactive.

137
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,432
Some of the strategies that Lili is going
to share with you.

138
00:08:32,432 --> 00:08:38,419
If you implement them now, the goal is to
perhaps develop good habits so that you can

139
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:43,848
already cope well by the time these traumas
start hitting.

140
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:47,320
It's important to take time to be patient
with yourself and develop resilience over

141
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:53,449
time and understand that, you know, each strategy
that Lili talks about that you put into place

142
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:56,079
builds towards this resilience.

143
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:57,079
Awesome.

144
00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:02,300
So, without further ado, Lili is going to
take you through the strategies we have developed

145
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,630
to develop this resilience.

146
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:09,870
LILI: Yes, thank you so much for going over
that, Rachel.

147
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,420
Really eloquently put.

148
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,530
You can't pour from an empty cup.

149
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:20,910
We have to help others through helping and
supporting ourselves.

150
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:28,069
But also, helping aside, you are a whole person
and there's value just in that.

151
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:31,770
So, remember to respect and honor yourself.

152
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,240
How do we do this, though?

153
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,390
I'm gonna present a few different strategies
today.

154
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,329
So, the first thing I'm gonna present is the
check in.

155
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:45,969
Checking in is especially important in order
to make sure that you're providing yourself

156
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,900
with self care.

157
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:52,110
Next slide, Rachel.

158
00:09:52,110 --> 00:10:00,189
So, we have some slides here from the Rated
R check in deck to guide you through the process

159
00:10:00,189 --> 00:10:01,480
of self care.

160
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,449
A lot of people think of self care in the
context of wine and face masks.

161
00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:07,380
Both of which are great.

162
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,110
But self care ultimately comes down to this.

163
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:16,950
These things include things like, are have
you showered or had water or eaten?

164
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,260
This is because our physical well being is
connected to our mental well being.

165
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:25,720
When we feel good physically, we can feel
good mentally.

166
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,140
Because it is all connected.

167
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:33,600
Our brains are a functioning part of our physical
selves.

168
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,510
And they and it's important to treat your
brain well.

169
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:43,020
So, then your brain can treat the rest of
your body well and vice versa.

170
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,949
Another great way to check in with yourself
and to make sure you're checking in with yourself

171
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:48,699
is mindfulness.

172
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,670
Mindfulness is the practice of being present
and aware of the self.

173
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:58,170
This allows you to be aware enough of yourself
and your needs in the moment so then you can

174
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,760
act on supporting yourself.

175
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:08,140
You can practice mindfulness through meditation
and a variety of cognitive behavioral exercises.

176
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:13,510
Another another great resource is YouFeelLikeShit.com.

177
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:20,610
It's an interactive guide to self care which
is really helpful for holding yourself accountable

178
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:24,000
and also motivating yourself through the process.

179
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,490
Especially when, you know, you're going through
something really difficult or when you're

180
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,319
just really tired.

181
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:37,449
And you don't even feel like you have the
energy to really check in with yourself.

182
00:11:37,449 --> 00:11:40,020
Next slide.

183
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,740
So, it's also really important to set boundaries
in life.

184
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,230
Both physically and mentally.

185
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,190
As I mentioned earlier, the physical and the
psychological world are deeply connected.

186
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:54,680
Psychologists say, for instance, your bed
should be only for two things, sleep and sex.

187
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:00,109
When you work in bed, for instance, your brain
begins to associate that space with stress,

188
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,620
making it harder to sleep.

189
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:07,549
I, for instance, used to work as an open source
investigator alongside Rachel.

190
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:13,660
And they really cautioned us against watching
any of the videos or really taking in any

191
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:20,910
of the material we had to take in for our
jobs anywhere that we wanted to be associated

192
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,689
with relaxation.

193
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:27,920
In part because the materials that we were
witnessing are really traumatizing and you

194
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,589
don't want to have a physical space associated
with trauma because then you're not going

195
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:36,910
to be able to use that physical space really
for fully what it's intended.

196
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,579
Like relaxation or sleep.

197
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:45,560
It's also important to not watch things like
movies and TV shows in bed.

198
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,829
Because then you're associating your bed with
entertainment.

199
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,380
Both ways take away from what your bed should
be associated with.

200
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:59,470
This is this entire system is called sleep
hygiene which is extremely important to making

201
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,919
sure you have a regular sleep schedule.

202
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:06,230
Which just, again, helps your mental health
so much.

203
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:11,000
If you can, it's also great to get different
devices for your work versus your personal

204
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
life.

205
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,990
So, you're having that association and then
you're able to set clear boundaries for yourself.

206
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:21,370
Not everyone has access to getting one device,
much less two.

207
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:25,520
So, you could also create separate accounts
on your device.

208
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,669
This helps optimize both your work and your
play.

209
00:13:29,669 --> 00:13:32,169
The same thing goes for social media accounts.

210
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:37,610
Have a Twitter for professional work and then
have a Twitter for just fun and memes.

211
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,679
Again, you're really drawing that line for
yourself.

212
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:46,819
Also, try to have a consistent schedule when
you're working and when you're not.

213
00:13:46,819 --> 00:13:52,979
Both of these help to make sure that you're
gonna get the most out of your time working

214
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,410
and out of your time relaxing.

215
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,550
Next slide.

216
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:01,109
And, of course, we all need somebody to lean
on.

217
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,559
Even the most introverted of us.

218
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:08,880
If you can't talk to people in your personal
life about your work, due to an NDA or because

219
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:15,650
you feel like they just won't understand,
try talking to coworkers or join a professional

220
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,650
network.

221
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:21,169
Also, if you have access, consider finding
a mental healthcare provider.

222
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:24,850
And remember that when you're looking for
a mental healthcare provider, that there's

223
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,120
a lot of different kinds of mental healthcare.

224
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,339
From therapists to psychiatrists.

225
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:36,059
When it comes to therapy, you can do psychoanalytical,
cognitive behavioral, dialectic behavioral.

226
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:41,900
There's also eye movement and desensitization
and reprocessing.

227
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:48,140
It's a great therapy for people with experience
with PTSD.

228
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:52,390
A lot of the times unfortunately these things
simply aren't accessible.

229
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:58,750
So, we have a free intersectional mental health
resource guide on our website.

230
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,050
Next slide.

231
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:08,560
And at the end of the day, it's just really
important to reflect and meditate on these

232
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,560
questions.

233
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:14,900
What do I wish to accomplish through my work?

234
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,400
Personally, impact wise?

235
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,500
What do I value?

236
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:25,900
Is my current time being spent fulfilling
those?

237
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:33,020
You know, even if my work is very fulfilling,
is it leaving space for me to just exist and

238
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,819
be fulfilled in a didn't way?

239
00:15:36,819 --> 00:15:45,719
And asking yourself these questions, you may
realize that you're no longer finding work

240
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:52,280
fulfilling and/or it's distracting from a
lot of fulfilling your life in other ways.

241
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:58,069
So, consider taking time to work, study or
volunteer in another field.

242
00:15:58,069 --> 00:16:05,620
Maybe reignite a passion for history that
you had when you were in college.

243
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:09,800
And if that's not something you can really
afford to do, ask your boss if you can try

244
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,859
different things at your work.

245
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:18,620
If you're someone who does a lot of documenting
hate crimes, for instance, that would get

246
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,280
very tired.

247
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,819
Tiring after a point.

248
00:16:21,819 --> 00:16:25,740
So, maybe ask if instead of doing that for
8 hours a day, you can do that for 4 hours

249
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,350
a day and work on something else.

250
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,839
Next slide.

251
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:35,829
And if you can, take a break.

252
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:36,910
Sometimes you just need a break.

253
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,600
And there's no shame in that.

254
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,890
And maybe you take a break, and you don't
come back and there's no shame in that either.

255
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:50,600
Sometimes we lose a passion for what we're
doing.

256
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,780
Sometimes we're still passionate about what
we do, but we're no longer able to function

257
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:04,220
as human beings, as ourselves within that
world.

258
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,810
It's a sad reality.

259
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,480
Especially when you still haven't lost that
love for your work.

260
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:13,480
But at the end of the day, you're a whole
person.

261
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:21,319
And you can find fulfilling work elsewhere
that allows you to also take care of yourself.

262
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:26,010
Of course, like I said, it can be a privilege
to leave these things behind.

263
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:32,020
But just try your best to find that little
corner of your life in order to make sure

264
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:36,780
you're taking care so that you can take care
of other things.

265
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:43,660
And in conclusion, I just really want to thank
everyone for coming here today and listening

266
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:48,140
to me and Rachel talk about something that
we're extremely passionate about.

267
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:54,660
Especially as former open source investigators
and for people who are currently doing work

268
00:17:54,660 --> 00:18:00,830
that can be traumatizing at times and stressful,
if not traumatizing.

269
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,550
So, thank you so much.

270
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:07,340
And you can find more of our resources at
RatedReslient.com.

271
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,760
Since we have a little bit of time left.

272
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,730
I'm going to open it up for exceptions we're
more than happy to answer them.

273
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,580
Or to go over different strategies.

274
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,740
MEGAN: Yes, thank you so much.

275
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:25,540
Really appreciate it, feel free to reach out
over Twitter, LinkedIn, our website.

276
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,540
Perfect.

277
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,700
Any questions? [this is Rachel] I can't see
the chat.

278
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,640
I'm presenting my screen.

279
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,610
LILI: You can exit out of that, Rachel.

280
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,010
RACHEL: I don't know if I can.

281
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,879
LILI: I see from Mia G.

282
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:50,610
How do you do with those surges of burnout
after you complete a major long term objective?

283
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:54,810
So, that is a great question, Mia.

284
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:58,370
It's really I mean, it's really difficult.

285
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,973
I've I've suffered through it myself.

286
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:05,309
But I think one of the things is prevention.

287
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:11,550
Resilience and mental health is not just something
that you do after you've experienced trauma.

288
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,010
It's something to prevent in the first place.

289
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:22,040
So, if you're taking care of yourself throughout
that major long term objective, then the burnout

290
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,740
will be less than it would be otherwise.

291
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:29,930
And so, keeping that preventive frame in mind
and not just burning yourself out and being

292
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,470
like, you know what?

293
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:35,000
I'll put a band aid on it later on that burn.

294
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,430
No, try to prevent it in the first place.

295
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:45,720
It depends on what resources you have, but
if you can take a break for a short amount

296
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:51,290
of time, because if you're burnt out, you're
burnt out.

297
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:55,500
The only way to deal with it is to give yourself
time and space.

298
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:01,760
And to have empathy for yourself like you
would have for one of your friends or family

299
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,760
members.

300
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,310
Treat yourself like you like your own best
friend.

301
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:10,000
I think that's really important.

302
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,470
MEGAN: Yeah.

303
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,680
LILI: Oh, sorry.

304
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,630
MEGAN: No, go ahead.

305
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,570
LILI: Oh, no, Rachel.

306
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:22,649
Just if you wanted to say anything?

307
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:26,470
RACHEL: No, that's all good.

308
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,000
Anything else?

309
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,350
Do we have time for one more?

310
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:36,570
MEGAN: I was just gonna say, it reminds me
of, you know, being on the airplane when they

311
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,820
say, put your oxygen mask on first before
you help others.

312
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,409
Because you really can't help others until
you've helped yourself.

313
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,620
RACHEL: Exactly.

314
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,830
LILI: Completely.

315
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:50,429
And, you know, you it's there are a lot of
steppingstones.

316
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:54,060
Like I said, sometimes you're so burnt out
that you find it hard to even take care of

317
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,060
yourself.

318
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,350
I think unfortunately a lot of us have been
there.

319
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,939
Especially in our modern work culture.

320
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:06,680
Even in school I know as someone who graduated
in 2020, I was completely burned out after

321
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,280
going to UC Berkeley for four years.

322
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,910
It was really difficult for me.

323
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:18,630
But you know, it's important to try to make
the effort to do those basic things.

324
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:23,700
Those building blocks of just food, water,
sleep.

325
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,370
And try to really build up from there if possible.

326
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:30,810
RACHEL: Yeah, I mean, I also think that when
you end a project, even though you feel burnt

327
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:33,830
out, there's an exciting moment of opportunity.

328
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:36,030
You finished the project.

329
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,110
What do you have to be excited about?

330
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:41,030
What freedom do you have to launch yourself
into what comes next?

331
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,649
I know exactly what you mean.

332
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:43,780
We're all finished with a project.

333
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,780
Whoa.

334
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:48,200
I feel like I'm exhausted and no longer working
towards a whole.

335
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,201
That's an important moment to reflect and
think, you know, how did I feel about what

336
00:21:52,201 --> 00:21:54,540
I was doing?

337
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,409
Was that a worthwhile use of my time?

338
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:59,600
How can I improve in how can I do better going
forward?

339
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,389
I think taking those moments and seeing them
as moments of opportunity to get excited about

340
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:08,570
the future rather than moments to sit with
the exhaustion of the past.

341
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:11,169
That's something that helps me get through
it.

342
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:14,070
If that makes sense.

343
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,070
Awesome.

344
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,250
LILI: Definitely.

345
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,650
No, totally, totally correct, Rachel.

346
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:22,260
I couldn't agree more.

347
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,870
So much of this is about framing.

348
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:28,760
Which, again, can be really hard to do in
the moment.

349
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:35,150
But that's a that's a great example of something
that, you know, a cognitive behavioral therapist

350
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,420
would maybe say to someone.

351
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,000
You know, when it comes to reframing.

352
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,620
And so, you can practice a lot of cognitive
behavioral exercises even without a therapist.

353
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:51,679
Although I do recommend a therapist instead
of me, personally.

354
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:56,240
Definitely, definitely there are some amazing
healthcare providers out there.

355
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,240
It may take you a while to get to one you
really meld with.

356
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,220
But I think definitely worth it.

357
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,160
Especially if you're finding yourself in burnout.

358
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,690
RACHEL: Beautiful.

359
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:10,340
MEGAN: Yeah, for sure.

360
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,580
LILI: Yeah.

361
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:20,409
MEGAN: Well, thank you, guys, for this.

362
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:27,890
You know, and there's there's some interesting
comments in the chat as well about I think

363
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:32,490
the kind of collective burnout that we're
feeling, you know, across the globe because

364
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,310
of the pandemic and everything else.

365
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,260
So, really appreciate your talk on this.

366
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,260
It was really refreshing.

367
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,970
Having those definitive tools and the toolkit
that you have on your website will be really

368
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:43,200
helpful to folks, I believe.

369
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,410
Thank you.

370
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,590
LILI: Thank you so much for having us.

371
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:49,280
And everyone, wishing you a lovely rest of
your day.

372
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,610
And a lovely resilient day.

373
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,370
RACHEL: Yes, yes.

374
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,129
LILI: All righty.

375
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:55,720
Bye!
