Rising from the Ashes
Rin Oliver

2
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,500
>> Second year in a row.

3
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:29,689
This is without a doubt one of the most anticipated
key notes of the 2021 hacker summer camp season.

4
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:32,049
So, you are in the right place.

5
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:36,550
I think the past 17 months have been a business
continuity planning nightmare to say the least

6
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,099
and an enormously challenging time for the
security community.

7
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,900
I am emerging from TDI21 with a lot of hope.

8
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,350
Everybody here gives me hope.

9
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:51,129
The teens in teen village give me a lot of
hope for the future of our industry.

10
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:54,489
And Rin in particular is a very bright spark.

11
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:58,949
I've had the privilege of working with Rin
in the past at a jobbie job and still get

12
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:05,140
to collaborate to hang out with Rin and watch
Rin's star rise as an incredible DevRel leader

13
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,400
and a highly sought after keynote speaker.

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,590
They teach me to be a better human.

15
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:18,010
Without further ado and before I start crying,
join me in welcoming Rin, technical community

16
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,560
builder at Camunda.

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,280
Rin's pronouns are he and they.

18
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,660
Rising from the Ashes.

19
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:31,759
RIN: Thank you to even at The Diana Initiative.

20
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:38,180
I'm Rin Oliver, a technical builder at Camunda.

21
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:44,090
Thank you to all the sponsors that made this
possible.

22
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,970
Check them out, check out their booths.

23
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,360
Check out everything they have to offer.

24
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,420
This is a wonderful event.

25
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,480
It would not be possible today without the
sponsors we have here.

26
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,460
And definitely please let them know how much
you appreciate them.

27
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,500
Because without them, we all wouldn't be here.

28
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,810
Thank you so much, sponsors.

29
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,420
Really appreciate you.

30
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,460
You're wonderful.

31
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,619
But on that note, who am I?

32
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,620
Good question.

33
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,110
I'm here speaking to you today.

34
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,440
And that's great!

35
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,640
But this journey really wasn't easy and as
a matter of fact, I actually almost gave up.

36
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,859
We're talking lowest lows you can get.

37
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,250
And it was really, really hard to get to this
point.

38
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,609
And that's what inspired this keynote.

39
00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:35,959
So, I am multiply neurodivergent, I'm autistic,
non binary, I have dyspraxia, dyscalculia,

40
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:38,959
and something ADD.

41
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,560
Something that I'm vaguely forgetting.

42
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,129
But, yes, that.

43
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:51,620
And those things have made it very challenging
to get a career in InfoSec and tech in general.

44
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,939
And this join wasn't easy.

45
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:59,170
And also, I lost a job in 2020 which is pandemic
times.

46
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,390
Which is not exactly the time where somebody
wants to go job hunting.

47
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:08,469
So, in 2019, I actually relocated from New
Zealand back to America.

48
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:14,029
And about 4 months after I got here, back
to America, tried to settle with life.

49
00:03:14,029 --> 00:03:15,040
I lost my job.

50
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,429
I'd had that job for 4 years and that one
hurt.

51
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,170
That was rough.

52
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,078
Life comes at ya fast!

53
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:27,380
And I thought that it was gonna be three days
later after that happened I could get on a

54
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:33,310
plane, and I went to London to give a presentation
about neurodiversity at Mozilla Festival and

55
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,379
I was one of the first people that got to
speak at the neurodiversity track.

56
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,310
Because it was their first one.

57
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,680
They weren't sure if they were going to do
it next year.

58
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,752
And they actually did do it next year.

59
00:03:43,752 --> 00:03:44,800
That was great.

60
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,470
That was good.

61
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:50,849
Having to put on a brave face for that was
really difficult.

62
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:56,140
And I thought that that was life was really
hard at that time.

63
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,208
And I didn't even know what was up ahead.

64
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:04,400
Because that was right and then 2020 happened.

65
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,760
So, not only was there, you know, the pandemic.

66
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,529
But where I live in Louisiana, there were
also there were also a lot of hurricanes.

67
00:04:12,529 --> 00:04:13,720
We had two hit us.

68
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,450
It was the day I started my job at Esper with
Jasmine.

69
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:24,840
I was powers my Internet which is by the way
satellite because we lived in a rural area

70
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,700
at the time.

71
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,210
That was challenging.

72
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,539
We lost two trees.

73
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,430
All the siding on our house had been ripped
off.

74
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,930
And it was just rough.

75
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:40,840
And that's not even taking into account that
before I met Jasmine, I actually skipped ahead

76
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,840
in my story.

77
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,729
Because before I met Jasmine, yeah, that was
even rougher.

78
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:50,650
And that's another reason why I'm giving this
talk today.

79
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:55,460
Because things things get challenging and
you think, this is the lowest itself ever

80
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,461
gonna get and how will I recover.

81
00:04:56,461 --> 00:05:00,819
But I'm happy to report in 2021, things are
looking up!

82
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:01,819
Finally!

83
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:02,819
Hooray!

84
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:03,819
That is wonderful.

85
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:05,550
The question is how did we get from point
A to point B?

86
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:10,960
And might be asking yourself, what happens
if I fail?

87
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,440
As Elizabeth says, just freaking do it.

88
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,979
What happens if you actually fail?

89
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:22,969
You do it again and again and wear them down
and they'll eventually get sick of rejecting

90
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:23,970
you.

91
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,440
They get sick of seeing the letters.

92
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,919
Part of searching for a job is confidence,
part is insecurity.

93
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,479
I need you to know that you will fail.

94
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,680
But that's okay.

95
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,700
Like I said, I sent out about 200 job applications
during that peak pandemic job hunt time.

96
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,700
I got seven interviews.

97
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:50,469
And out of those seven, five of them got pulled
because of the pandemic.

98
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:55,120
And two of them put me through finals only
not to hire me at the end.

99
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,750
So, you will fail.

100
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:01,080
But it's what you do after that matters.

101
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,080
And being vulnerable on the Internet actually
got me a job.

102
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,159
I'm not joking.

103
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:06,159
It did.

104
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:07,680
That's how I met Jasmine.

105
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,330
And that's very, very important.

106
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,740
Because vulnerability can be an asset.

107
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,470
And I know it's really hard, especially for
people that are neurodivergent to be vulnerable.

108
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,189
To open up and share how we're feeling.

109
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:21,040
But if you share the feelings and say I'm
really struggling right now, you never know

110
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,740
what can happen.

111
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:29,500
And if I hadn't done that and I hadn't had
the bravery, I'm going to say, yes, I'm going

112
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
to call myself brave.

113
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,500
I'm struggling.

114
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,099
And I don't know how much longer I can make
it in this industry or how to be that depressed

115
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:41,719
job hunting in the pandemic as someone that's
a member of the LGBT community and that is

116
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,720
being neurodivergent.

117
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,840
I sat on the Internet and yelling into the
void.

118
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:51,919
If I hadn't done that, I wouldn't have met
Jasmine and wouldn't have gotten my job at

119
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:52,919
Camunda.

120
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:57,669
Being sad on the Internet got my words in
front of Jasmine at the exact right moment.

121
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:03,689
You never know who is going to see your Tweets
and never know who they know.

122
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:09,159
But that's a future slide and that's also
really important as well.

123
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:14,699
Making candles was how I kept moving forward
when absolutely all I wanted to do was give

124
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:15,699
up.

125
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:16,699
Nope.

126
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:17,699
I'm done, walking away.

127
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:20,569
Having something to focus on the upside of
the job hunt reaction cycle which was never

128
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:26,310
ending at that point because I sent out so
many President Clintons was it was great.

129
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:31,710
I made candles, I made wax melts and just
kept afloat by making things that were pretty

130
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,000
and happy.

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,180
And it also kept me afloat financially which
was really nice.

132
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,370
That was super fun.

133
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,590
And shoutout to all of our candle customers.

134
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,900
Love you all.

135
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,729
But having something to focus on.

136
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:47,940
You can't just be 24/7 grind.

137
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:52,819
Grind mentality is nice and all, but you've
got to have something that's not the grind.

138
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:54,310
Whatever that thing is.

139
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,409
If it's pets, plants, if it's candles.

140
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,409
Whatever.

141
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:58,409
Gaming.

142
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:00,150
Whatever you enjoy.

143
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:04,560
Find something that's not just sitting there
waiting for rejection emails.

144
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
That would be horrible.

145
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,970
You don't want that.

146
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:12,449
Find something to focus on that brings you
joy that is not just waiting for rejections

147
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:13,689
or prepping for interviews.

148
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:16,080
You can't just be on the grind.

149
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,060
That's not good for anyone.

150
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,389
Another thing that you can do is ask for referrals.

151
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:28,189
I am absolutely begging you to find a team
of cheerleaders that will hype you up.

152
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:31,889
Find someone in your corner, whoever it is
that will say, you need to hire this person.

153
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:33,429
They are amazing.

154
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,968
Having that person that believes in you and
hypes you up.

155
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:41,190
Saying that what this person has to offer
is important to our company.

156
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:44,039
If question don't their them, you are making
a mistake.

157
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,300
Find that cheer leader.

158
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,120
Surround yourself with people who think you're
amazing.

159
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,889
Ask for your friends to give you referrals.

160
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:53,889
Can you give me a reference?

161
00:08:53,889 --> 00:09:00,060
Can you give me a recommendation on LinkedIn?

162
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,660
Greenhouse link, give me something here.

163
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:08,480
Because you know people that will vouch for
you and if you think your friends won't talk

164
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,440
you up, then they probably will.

165
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,940
And if they don't, I suggest that you should
ask them.

166
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,940
Because you never know.

167
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,940
You might be scared.

168
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,990
Might say, my friends are too busy, my friends,
we don't talk about work.

169
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,130
We're not that close of friends.

170
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:30,920
But if you're struggling like I was struggling
in 2020 and you have hit that low where you

171
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,849
think this is never gonna get better.

172
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,980
I am never gonna be able to do this.

173
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,230
And there is nothing I can do.

174
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:41,750
And if you've hit that point where you are
absolutely in the darkest depths of depression

175
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:49,620
that you see no way out, like I was, having
someone like I did with Jasmine that will

176
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,829
say, if we don't hire Rin, which is what she
said, we are making a mistake.

177
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:56,290
And that meant so much.

178
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:00,069
And it got me in front of Esper which got
me in front of Camunda.

179
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:07,730
And you need to have people in your life who
will say, if we don't hire this person, it

180
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,950
will be a loss for our company.

181
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,700
And what's more important is you need to believe
it too.

182
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,700
You are worth something.

183
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,029
You are worth referrals, and you are worth
everything and more.

184
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:22,519
Because each and every one of us has something
special to offer this industry.

185
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:23,519
And I know it's hard.

186
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,990
And I have been there.

187
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,890
Have I ever been there?

188
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:34,600
And I feel that having a team around you that
understands your worth and will tell you your

189
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,870
worth when you don't believe it is key.

190
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,170
And have those people in your corner that
will say, I know that you don't believe that

191
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,569
you're worth it, but you are.

192
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,650
And I'm gonna show you.

193
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:47,300
When you don't believe it yourself.

194
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:53,529
Another thing you can do, on a happier note,
is find people to share your interests.

195
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:55,050
And whatever those are.

196
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:58,560
It's, again, gaming, candles, plants, whatever
that is.

197
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,439
A lot of my coworkers and I love house plants.

198
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:07,940
So, we sent here and send pictures of pepper
plants or talk about whatever the plants may

199
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,940
be.

200
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,130
We have a whole house plant thing over at
Camunda.

201
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,970
My manager is growing squash.

202
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,810
I hope your squash are okay!

203
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:21,310
And I feel like it's very important to have
people around you that share interests that

204
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,109
are outside of tech.

205
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:29,290
And whatever that is, just have hobbies that
you can go to that aren't, again, that rejection

206
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,680
job cycle, especially if you're job hunting.

207
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,540
Even if you do have a job and you're comfortable
and you have a great job and you're happy,

208
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,069
don't spend all your time on the computer.

209
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:40,380
Again, I know it's really difficult get out
of that grind mentality.

210
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,380
I could be working.

211
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,380
I could be checking Slack.

212
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,380
What if I check Slack?

213
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,380
What if I check my email?

214
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,380
Nope.

215
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,380
Don't do did.

216
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,380
You have weekends.

217
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,380
You have days off.

218
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,251
When work is done, work is done.

219
00:11:51,251 --> 00:11:52,579
Don't do it.

220
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:55,579
Go out, enjoy your hobbies.

221
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,800
You deserve that time.

222
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,199
And I know it's hard.

223
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,200
Especially if you're a manager.

224
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,639
Or even if you're a higher up IC.

225
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:02,930
Like, it can be hard.

226
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,719
It can be hard, especially if you want a promotion.

227
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,779
Right now I'm going for a promotion, no joke.

228
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:10,620
And it's hard to be sitting there and be like,
what if I could be working?

229
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,090
But the thing is at a company that understands
your worth, they'll say you don't need to

230
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,060
grind to prove that you belong here.

231
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:24,709
To prove that you are capable of doing that.

232
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:25,709
You deserve your time off.

233
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:26,901
You don't have to grind to prove anything.

234
00:12:26,901 --> 00:12:28,839
And that's really important too.

235
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:34,800
So, find people that will tell you that you
don't need to grind or burn out to prove your

236
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
worth.

237
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,949
Because that's not how you do it.

238
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:41,899
You shouldn't be somewhere where they make
you grind to prove your worth.

239
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:45,320
They should know it without you having to
do that.

240
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,320
And yeah.

241
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,320
Find some hobbies.

242
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,320
Do something fun.

243
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,740
Do something nice for yourself.

244
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,079
It's always good.

245
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:57,660
Another thing you can do in terms of rising
from the ashes and dusting off and recovering

246
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,300
from those setbacks is looking for mentors.

247
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,689
And that can be hard.

248
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,709
And it's really challenging, especially, of
course, in the pandemic times.

249
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:05,709
Super challenging.

250
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:10,930
But that's why there's Zoom and Microsoft
Teams or Google Duo or whatever.

251
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,829
Insert chat program here.

252
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,279
And you can also, of course, be a good mentee.

253
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,000
We have all seen those threads on Twitter.

254
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,240
Here's what to do to be a good mentor.

255
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,930
But you also have to be a good mentee.

256
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:25,949
Show up on time and be there and be respectful.

257
00:13:25,949 --> 00:13:30,099
Especially if you have a mentor that's giving
a lot of time to help you specifically.

258
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,750
Be a good mentor if you are mentoring, be
a good mentor.

259
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,660
And if you are a mentee, be a good mentee.

260
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,459
It's that simple.

261
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:44,699
Being a good mentee can take a lot of effort
especially if you're neurodivergent because

262
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:48,329
it can often seem like a struggle if your
mentor is neurotypical.

263
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:54,050
I highly recommend drafting a how to work
with me sheet and just bring that to your

264
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,459
first session with your mentor.

265
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,810
Here's how I work best.

266
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,170
Here's how we can communicate.

267
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,050
Here's how we should work together on these
projects.

268
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:04,769
And here's what I would like to learn and
here's how you can work together with me so

269
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:09,420
that we can together accomplish these goals
so we can get a fulfilling joint thing out

270
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,259
of this mentor, mentee relationship.

271
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:17,880
Having a plan going into a program is important.

272
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,620
Make sure you've got it leveled out and your
mentor agrees too.

273
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:27,250
That way you will be happy at the end and
not leave feeling disappointed.

274
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,700
Meet friends of friends.

275
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,019
You never know who your friends know.

276
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:35,630
They might be someone who is hiring or has
a different role if you're looking for a different

277
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,630
job.

278
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,829
You never know.

279
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:41,689
Meet your friends friends and see who they
know.

280
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:45,660
Because you might not know it now, but they
might have something you need in the future

281
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,980
or might have something you need or vice versa.

282
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,399
You'll never know.

283
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,759
And you'll never know unless you ask.

284
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:55,980
So, I think that's very important that you
meet your friends friends.

285
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,490
Because without them, it's it can be challenging.

286
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:03,990
And I think that's really something that's
important is that you broaden your network.

287
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:08,459
It can really be a small, small place.

288
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:10,380
Especially on server security on the Internet.

289
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:15,939
And I think that by casting a larger net and
meeting friends outside of your direct inner

290
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:19,779
circle you can meet people that aren't necessarily
like you.

291
00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:23,800
They don't have the same job, they don't have
the same background, they didn't go to the

292
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,099
same schools, they don't have the same interests,
et cetera.

293
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,100
Whatever that may be.

294
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,100
Diversify your life.

295
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,940
Meet your friends friends.

296
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,569
Figure out who you and who you don't, more
importantly.

297
00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:35,579
Meet new people.

298
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:37,930
Always be meeting new people and making new
friends.

299
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:44,300
I think that's super important because without
having friends of friends and extending your

300
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,990
network, you might not get opportunities.

301
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:50,329
And people might miss out on meeting you because
you are a catch.

302
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:51,888
Because that's important.

303
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:54,329
Get out there, network.

304
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:59,550
And, of course, introduce yourself to others
because you are worth it, and you deserve

305
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:05,540
to meet everyone that could ever influence
your life in a positive way.

306
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,130
Another thing you can do is, of course, take
classes.

307
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,160
Learn something new.

308
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,439
Hone those skills.

309
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,709
I recently took a glass blowing class with
my wife and we made mugs and feeders.

310
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:19,829
That was something I never would have thought
to do a year ago.

311
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:21,300
But we did it anyway.

312
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,370
Now we have a beer mug.

313
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,199
Even though I don't drink beer.

314
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:25,420
But it's a mug.

315
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,939
It can hold other things.

316
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,779
And she has a hummingbird feeder.

317
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,720
And birds come to it now.

318
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,680
It was wild and fun, and it was new.

319
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,910
And it was really cool.

320
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:42,959
And it gave us a chance to hone skills that
we didn't necessarily think of to go outside

321
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:48,819
of computers and to get off the Internet and
go outside and do something cool.

322
00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:49,819
Disclaimer.

323
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:51,160
We're both fully vaccinated.

324
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,029
So, that was good.

325
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:55,829
We wouldn't have done it otherwise.

326
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:57,630
But, yeah, in terms of safety.

327
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:02,450
For right now, yeah, go out and learn something
new if you feel it's safe.

328
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,369
If not, there's online classes.

329
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:05,770
There's a demo.

330
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,579
I'm taking a course in Java.

331
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:19,919
And, of course, we have the backlog of Udemy
courses that we bought on sale.

332
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,140
Get the certificates and show them off on
your LinkedIn.

333
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,990
That's what they're there for.

334
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:28,150
And use them to leverage those skills and
say, here's what I know and here's what I

335
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:32,180
can bring to the table when you go and negotiate
and ask for that money because you deserve

336
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,180
it.

337
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,669
Get that back.

338
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:36,410
Get the cash and get paid.

339
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,929
Because you are worth it.

340
00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:43,090
So, definitely, go through that backlog of
Udemy courses and add those certs that you

341
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:46,570
have been sitting on to your LinkedIn profile
because it's worth it.

342
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:50,350
And I know people say it's not, but it can
be.

343
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:53,559
And even then, you still did it.

344
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:56,070
Why not have the shiny cool thing on the Internet.

345
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,480
Even if it's just pixels you did it.

346
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,429
Don't shy way, they might look at it.

347
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:05,750
If it gets you a new job or an interview that
you didn't think you would get.

348
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,750
Worth a shot.

349
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,750
Never know until you try.

350
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:14,330
Another thing you can do, of course, is put
yourself out there.

351
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,330
Go network.

352
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,330
I know it's really hard.

353
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,199
Especially for people that are neurodivergent.

354
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,450
This is the hardest thing you can do usually.

355
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,510
It's hard, but it's worth it.

356
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,629
And networking is awesome.

357
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,789
Because it gives you a chance to meet people.

358
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:30,789
There's actually a networking event after
the keynote and you should go.

359
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:34,850
Because you never know who you're gonna meet
and that's really fun to do because it gets

360
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:39,379
you out of your comfort zone and it lets you
meet people that aren't necessarily in your

361
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,559
social sphere that you might not know.

362
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:42,730
And they may or may not be hiring.

363
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,530
But if not, you have a new friend.

364
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:50,980
Follow each other on Twitter and you can be
on each other's likes a lot.

365
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,980
Still friends.

366
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,980
Awesome.

367
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:59,090
By puts yourself out there, you are saying
this is who I am and what I have to offer

368
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:02,090
as a friend and as a person and potentially
as a colleague.

369
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:05,990
They can come back and say, this is who I
am and what I've got.

370
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:09,460
And we can decide if we want to continue talking.

371
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,909
And speed networking is cool.

372
00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:14,360
I mean, for this one, I think it's 5 minutes.

373
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,840
You can say hi to somebody in 5 minutes and
get to know them, at least on a superficial

374
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,840
level.

375
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,590
If you like them, you like them.

376
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,610
To you don't, you don't.

377
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,740
But still cool.

378
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:30,880
And I think networking is understated in a
lot of ways because networking and the social

379
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,800
mixers are just like I said, for people that
are neurodivergent, it's often like nails

380
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
on a chalk board.

381
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,090
It's really hard to go into these situation.

382
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:44,639
I find if there's a place that's quiet, there's
a quiet corner, it makes it better.

383
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,870
So, as long as there's somewhere to destress
for a little bit, the quieter space where

384
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,158
everybody is not chilling.

385
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:53,270
That's usually nice.

386
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:57,620
So, I find by going to networking events,
even if you don't want to, even for 15 minutes

387
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,939
and then you bail, at least you went.

388
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,169
People can say hi and you can say hi to them.

389
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:05,720
And you might like it more than you thought.

390
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,720
You never know.

391
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:13,360
But by going out there and meeting new people,
you can get to know others and you can socialize

392
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:20,539
and just be aware of those around you in a
context that is not necessarily work.

393
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:25,370
Networking events are cool in that it's it
can be work related if it's one of the work

394
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,510
social networking things.

395
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:30,350
But if it's one, it's like at a conference
where it's just a meet and greet.

396
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,550
Those are fun because they're a little bit
more casual.

397
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,799
And for me, I like those casual ones because
there's not the pressure to be performing

398
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:37,070
work.

399
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,580
You don't have to put on the work persona.

400
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:42,789
And if you're going network and you're neurodivergent,
stick to the casual events.

401
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:50,809
They're a lot easier on you and you'll find
it a lot easier to handle those ones.

402
00:20:50,809 --> 00:20:57,770
Making connections can be hard.

403
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,429
There's no such thing as a useless question.

404
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:06,179
If they say it's useless, say what didn't
make sense you?

405
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:11,000
Then they'll have to explain it and probably
feel bad.

406
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,909
Hopefully, anyway.

407
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:16,760
So, don't be afraid to ask questions.

408
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,360
Because asking questions is how you learn
things.

409
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,100
And depending on how you've learned, these
questions can take different forms.

410
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,530
So, you've got to realize that people learn
differently.

411
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,590
Some people learn by listening.

412
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,949
Some people learn by reading things.

413
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:32,790
Some people learn by building things with
their hands.

414
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:36,399
And people all learn in very different ways,
and this means that they'll have different

415
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,790
questions depending on how they learn.

416
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:42,408
So, especially if you're into programming
or you're in security, you might have different

417
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:44,340
questions for something you're working on.

418
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,139
If you're trying to debug something and you're
an audio learner, you probably want to watch

419
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,570
a video that explains what you're trying to
debug.

420
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:56,300
Watch a video that walks you through that
code or listen to a tutorial.

421
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,980
Or if you learn also by reading, you want
to go through go and read those logs.

422
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,480
You won't necessarily want to watch a video.

423
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,650
You won't necessarily want to listen to a
podcast that explains it in more detail.

424
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:09,470
You won't want to go build something with
your hands.

425
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,940
Depending on how you learn, that's how you
solve problems.

426
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:17,610
So, asking questions based on how you learn
is key to solving issues that you're facing.

427
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:23,510
So, learning how to ask those questions that
will complement the way that you learn best

428
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,510
is key.

429
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,900
So, learn how to ask questions that makes
sense to your brain.

430
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,010
Don't try a different brain, you won't win.

431
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:35,100
You know your brain better than anyone.

432
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,559
Hack your brain.

433
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,110
For lack of a better term, hack your brain.

434
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:44,120
And just especially when you're neurodivergent,
it can be really hard.

435
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:52,080
I have dyscalculia, and with the math that
comes with JavaScript, hm, about that.

436
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,080
It can be challenging.

437
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,580
Especially when we get into more complex algebra.

438
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:04,340
And the one thing I found out through my work
at Esper and Camunda is I'm actually really

439
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:07,428
good at complex linear algebra.

440
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:10,429
And so much the stuff with the letters.

441
00:23:10,429 --> 00:23:12,580
Don't like that.

442
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,019
And statistics.

443
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:16,150
Also very good at statistics.

444
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,150
Which, shocker.

445
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:22,059
But, again, if you're put in situations where
a lot of people are put in situations where

446
00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:23,309
they feel like they're always going to fail.

447
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:27,970
But if you are put in situations that are
set up for success and you play to your strengths,

448
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,880
you will win and you will shine.

449
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,230
Find a company, an organization and a team
that sets you up for success.

450
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:36,980
Don't work somewhere that sets you up for
failure.

451
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:41,640
Always go somewhere where they say here's
where we're going to set you up to win.

452
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,800
You deserve that and more.

453
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,830
And another thing you can do, psych yourself
up.

454
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,199
You are amazing.

455
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,200
You can do this.

456
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,200
Whatever it may be.

457
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
You can do it.

458
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,200
I promise.

459
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,919
Another thing, too, of course, if you have
a mentor, respect their time.

460
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,760
Yours is worth something too.

461
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:03,158
If your mentor disrespects are your time,
find a new one.

462
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:07,380
Again, your time is worth something and you
deserve respect.

463
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:12,640
So, keep that in mind.

464
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,299
Picking yourself up when you're down seems
really, really simple.

465
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:19,149
But it's really, really not.

466
00:24:19,149 --> 00:24:20,658
That's the thing.

467
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:24,070
It's a real challenge to overcome.

468
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:29,010
I can't even necessarily you can't really
overcome depression.

469
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,390
I should know.

470
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,390
I'm on antidepressants.

471
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,880
Yeah, we're doing down the mental health road.

472
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:39,220
Would this be a track with me sitting here
with you without talking about mental health

473
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,220
and neurodiversity?

474
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,220
No, it wouldn't.

475
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:47,640
I'm on antidepressants because I couldn't
pick myself all the way up.

476
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,640
And that's okay.

477
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,289
There's no shame in asking for help.

478
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:56,149
It is okay to not be okay and to say I am
struggling, and I need help.

479
00:24:56,149 --> 00:24:59,729
And picking yourself up can look like a lot
of things.

480
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,429
It can look like asking for help.

481
00:25:01,429 --> 00:25:03,510
It can look like taking morning meds.

482
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:08,129
It can look like setting alarms so that you
remember to take said morning meds.

483
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:11,440
It can look like taking a few days off.

484
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,080
It can look like self care.

485
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:20,860
Or like staying a little late at work because
you like working with your team and that makes

486
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,029
you happy.

487
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:24,370
Whatever that may be.

488
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,370
Yeah.

489
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,549
Picking yourself up is hard.

490
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:29,510
And it can be a real, real struggle.

491
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:32,150
But you should never be afraid to ask for
help.

492
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:36,659
Whatever that may look like.

493
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:39,020
And another thing I would like to talk about
is resilience.

494
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,330
I have been guilty of talking about resilience
a lot.

495
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:46,720
And I would like to actually add an addendum
to my past talks about resilience.

496
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,510
Because resilience isn't a substitute for
a nurturing community.

497
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:55,140
If you don't have a nurturing community, it
doesn't matter how strong or tough you are,

498
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,510
you are going to feel alone.

499
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,740
And I know because I have been there.

500
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,740
And it's hard.

501
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,500
It's hard to recover from that.

502
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:15,679
And I feel like [sigh] if you have hit the
point where you're at that depression level

503
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:21,150
where you are trying really, really hard to
be positive and slay those interviews and

504
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:25,580
be like just killin' it and you're out there
on the ground and booking interview after

505
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,270
interview and you're super hyped and trying
to stay positive.

506
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:32,230
Because if you don't, the alternative is really
bad.

507
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,230
That was me.

508
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,230
I have been there.

509
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,700
I have been super positive.

510
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,690
And I've also been super sad online.

511
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,029
Like I said.

512
00:26:40,029 --> 00:26:44,679
I have sent Tweets where I said, I don't know
how much longer I can be in this industry.

513
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:46,600
I'm almost I'm out of hope.

514
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,600
I'm done.

515
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:56,639
And I was try so good hard to be resilient
and I was at that point pretty alone.

516
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,020
And it was hard.

517
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:04,309
And I feel like having a community was at
that point really helpful.

518
00:27:04,309 --> 00:27:07,990
Because without my wife and without having
met Jasmine and about The Diana Initiative

519
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:12,520
community and my friends in the Kubernetes
community there are way too many of you to

520
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:20,090
list in this keynote and my and everyone that
I've met throughout my journey in tech, it

521
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,889
would have been a lot harder.

522
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,649
So, resilience is great and all, but you also
need community.

523
00:27:25,649 --> 00:27:26,840
You need friends.

524
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:31,379
Because you can only do the resilience thing
for so long.

525
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,049
And I feel like there's no shame in admitting
that.

526
00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:35,049
That you need friends, that you need help.

527
00:27:35,049 --> 00:27:42,110
And that you need a little more pick me up
from the people around you.

528
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,399
You should never be afraid to ask for help
from the people around you.

529
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:47,879
To ask for those cheerleaders to come in and
pick you up.

530
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,130
And they should if they're in that cheerleader
squad be able to do it.

531
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:58,440
And it's okay if they can't, again, you have
to respect boundaries here.

532
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,440
But...

533
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,760
Why resilience is important?

534
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,760
You should have a community that you can lean
on.

535
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,590
And if you can't find one, I promise you,
you have one here.

536
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:09,610
The Diana Initiative is a thriving community
and we're here to help each other and it's

537
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:14,039
a great place to be and I'm thrilled to be
here, and I wouldn't be where I am today if

538
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:15,080
I hadn't met this community.

539
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:20,668
And I highly recommend that you stick around
for the socials and meet in here because it's

540
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:26,789
a wonderful group and they help one another
and building community can be really hard.

541
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:30,870
But this is a good place to start.

542
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:34,178
And remember to regroup.

543
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:36,769
Try to see the bigger picture.

544
00:28:36,769 --> 00:28:39,050
It might be really hard to see the forest
for the trees.

545
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,340
But you can always take a step back.

546
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,949
It's hard to see that big picture.

547
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,269
Especially when you're in those dark, dark,
dark times.

548
00:28:46,269 --> 00:28:47,970
It is hard.

549
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:51,309
It is really, really hard to do.

550
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:56,090
And I know because I've got over in the corner
that say that was that hard.

551
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:57,090
Again.

552
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:58,090
It's okay.

553
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,340
I'm going to say that.

554
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,340
I have been there.

555
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,490
It's okay to be in that darkness.

556
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,510
You can see the way out.

557
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:08,900
You can rise from the ashes because you are
worth it.

558
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,510
And eventually we'll all rise, and we will
be Phoenixes and it will be awesome!

559
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:17,480
But for right now, if you are sitting there
and you are under those ashes and you don't

560
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,080
see any way out, I promise you, there is a
way.

561
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,490
I promise you there is.

562
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:28,610
And I feel like seeing that bigger picture
can be really difficult when you are in that

563
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,418
moment, and you are so far down.

564
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:33,100
That there is no hope, and you feel like no
matter how hard you're trying, no matter how

565
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,678
many interviews you're going to do, you are
never going to get there.

566
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:41,301
Just take a step back, breathe, and remember
that you are worth it.

567
00:29:41,301 --> 00:29:47,809
And that eventually, it might not be today,
it might not be tomorrow, it might not be

568
00:29:47,809 --> 00:29:48,940
a week from now.

569
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:53,130
Eventually everything will get better.

570
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:57,840
To that note, focus on what you can improve
right now.

571
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,840
Not tomorrow.

572
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,840
Not a week from now.

573
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,840
Right now.

574
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,840
At this very moment.

575
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,570
What can you improve?

576
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:04,689
It can be a line of code.

577
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:08,929
It can be a Twitter bio, take a selfie.

578
00:30:08,929 --> 00:30:09,929
Whatever it is.

579
00:30:09,929 --> 00:30:14,880
If you can improve one thing about yourself,
or about your day, about your job hunt or

580
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,880
your resume or even just your personal life,
something you can improve at this very moment

581
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,250
in time right now, what can you improve that
will make your life better?

582
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,289
Focus on that.

583
00:30:26,289 --> 00:30:27,960
Especially if you're in those dark times.

584
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,610
Focus on something that you can improve right
now that will make you feel a little better.

585
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:38,760
I think that's very, very important.

586
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:43,360
And also, keep in mind all it takes is one
person just one person to say yes.

587
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,979
I had, no joke, 18 0 something noes.

588
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,789
That's a lot of nos.

589
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:51,660
A lot of them are autoresponder.

590
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,230
That's fun.

591
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:57,659
But some of them were humans after 7 hours
of interviews.

592
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:02,140
We ve all been there, through that 7 hour
final interview and you imagine you're in

593
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,980
the merch and getting the swag box.

594
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:12,029
But then you get that email, I'm sorry, but
we decided to go with another candidate.

595
00:31:12,029 --> 00:31:17,520
And you sit there and think, wow. 6 weeks
of interviews, 12, 13 hours.

596
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:22,720
And all I get is we went with someone else.

597
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,350
And if you're a marginalized person, you find
out that the person that was hired was a cis

598
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,809
gendered white dude.

599
00:31:29,809 --> 00:31:34,840
I bet there's a lot of people like myself
that have had that happen.

600
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,049
That's rough.

601
00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:38,179
That one hurts a lot.

602
00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:40,059
And it's gonna happen.

603
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:41,950
It's gonna happen.

604
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:43,669
And it's gonna hurt.

605
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:49,769
But the important thing to remember is that
for all those noes, and there will be a lot

606
00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:55,950
of them, all it takes is one yes to get your
life to a place where you never imagined it

607
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,539
would be.

608
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:00,799
And for me, I never imagined I would be here.

609
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:06,279
I never imagined I would have the opportunities
I do now at Camunda or imagined I would give

610
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:07,380
a closing keynote.

611
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:12,299
But I am because one person said yes.

612
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:17,340
No matter how dark, there was a light at the
end of the tunnel and a spark.

613
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:21,928
And if you hold on to that and remember tomorrow
is a better day and you might get a yes.

614
00:32:21,929 --> 00:32:28,070
Hold ton that because it just takes one person.

615
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:34,730
Another thing, too, like I said earlier, lean
on your community, which is super important.

616
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:42,120
It's really, really fun for a lot of neurodivergent
people to think we have to do everything alone.

617
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:48,219
We have to be resilient because I know the
stigma about people that are neurodivergent,

618
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:51,140
and the stigma about being autistic.

619
00:32:51,140 --> 00:33:02,190
I heard it not from my family, from the newspapers
and how difficult for parents.

620
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:07,039
How challenging it was to be a parent of an
autistic child.

621
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,529
How much it was a struggle.

622
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:13,470
But I'm lucky that my parents didn't see it
that way.

623
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:16,320
So, they never made me feel like a burden.

624
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,100
So, that's that was really good share out.

625
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,240
Thanks, parents!

626
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,210
But leaning on your community is important.

627
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:28,639
Because a lot of us that are neurodivergent
internalize that stigma that says who you

628
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:29,830
are is a burden.

629
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:30,830
That's not true.

630
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,449
You are not a burden.

631
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:36,160
Being neurodivergent is not a burden and no
one should ever make you feel that way.

632
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,160
You are not.

633
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,960
Your existence is not a burden.

634
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,240
You don't have to do everything by yourself.

635
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,870
It is okay to ask for help and you deserve
to be helped when you ask.

636
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:52,649
So, lean on your community, lean on your friends
and embrace the help that is offered to you.

637
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:55,220
Because it's important to also accept help
gracefully.

638
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,320
And that can be hard too.

639
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,320
That can be hard to say, yes, it's okay.

640
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,289
I'm really struggling with this.

641
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:04,000
Because especially if you've had employer
trauma or been let down in the past when you've

642
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
asked for help.

643
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,120
It can be hard to say, okay, I need help now.

644
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:15,138
But if you don't ask, I'm not going to lie
and say they won't let you down.

645
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:16,139
They might.

646
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,139
That's a risk to take.

647
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,449
But life comes with risk.

648
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:23,580
And we have to assess those and if the risk
is worth it.

649
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:30,120
If you need help, you should take that risk
and lean on your community.

650
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:34,069
Because chances are they will come forth and
they will rally around you, and they will

651
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,880
get you to be.

652
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:40,810
So, lean on that community because you don't
have to do everything by yourself and there's

653
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:45,500
people out there that want to help you.

654
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,620
Another thing, too, very important.

655
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,620
Set boundaries.

656
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,069
Your future self will absolutely thank you.

657
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:53,610
You might not know what they are.

658
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,110
Boundaries, what's that?

659
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:59,700
Boundaries are just a list of things that
you will or won't do.

660
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,640
Like, I don't want to work after such and
such time.

661
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,220
I don't want to get calls after X time.

662
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:13,700
I don't like to get communication via this
method of I don't like to be texted, I don't

663
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,419
like to be called, whatever it is.

664
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,440
Set boundaries.

665
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,710
Very important.

666
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:23,350
Because without boundaries, people will walk
all over you.

667
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:29,440
So, setting boundaries means that you know
your worth and you know what you will or won't

668
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,990
accept in a work environment.

669
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:34,200
And even in your personal life or your professional
life.

670
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,230
Having boundaries is great in every aspect
of your life.

671
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:38,030
Not just your professional one.

672
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:44,290
Boundaries are key because they mean that
you have things about your life that you say

673
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:45,550
this is a hard line for me.

674
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,950
I would like if you respected this.

675
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:52,310
And if somebody doesn't respect your boundaries,
then they don't respect you.

676
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:54,400
And that's on you how you deal with that.

677
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,560
But I think having boundaries and addressing
those and making sure people understand them

678
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,560
is key.

679
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:06,240
At the same time make sure that people understand
them and that you adhere to them too.

680
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,240
It's important.

681
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,910
Like if you have a boundary, don't people
will try to flex your boundaries, try to flex

682
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:12,020
them and get past.

683
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,250
It's like a pentest, they'll see with the
weak points are.

684
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:21,470
If you said yes this one time, if you answered
the call at 7 p.m., maybe you will at 9:00.

685
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,859
There's not that much of a difference.

686
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,350
Reject the call.

687
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:31,730
They'll leave a message, and you can check
it in the morning.

688
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:35,010
Unless you're on call, in that case you should
probably answer your phone.

689
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:39,850
But if you're not on call, you deserve your
boundaries to be respected.

690
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:46,009
People will try to find the weak points and
take advantage of it if you don't set the

691
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,140
boundaries.

692
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:53,609
shore up the boundaries and make sure everything
is stable and stick to them and make sure

693
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:56,700
that people understand them and they're very
clear.

694
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:03,069
That way there's no miscommunications and
everybody understands what is expected of

695
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,690
everybody else.

696
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:10,170
So, another thing that's important to remember
is that you will rise above the ashes.

697
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:15,340
Even your absolute worst day will soon be
just a memory.

698
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:21,090
And that's really important because I thought
I had a lot of days that were my worst days.

699
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:23,350
And I've had a few that absolutely felt like
that.

700
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:27,700
That there was never going to be another good
day.

701
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,700
Ever.

702
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:32,419
I think and we've all been there at some points
where you think this is the worst it's ever

703
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,360
going to get, and I don't know how I will
make it another day.

704
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,640
I don't know how I'm going to get up in the
morning and do this again.

705
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,640
But you do.

706
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,680
You do get up in the morning and you do it
again.

707
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:49,379
Because someday it's all gonna be in the past
and you'll be able to look at it and say,

708
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,380
wow.

709
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,050
I've come a really long way.

710
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:58,570
And I am very blessed and very grateful this
is where I'm at right now.

711
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:01,620
That day that I thought was my worst day.

712
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,620
It was bad.

713
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,620
But it wasn't my worst.

714
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,870
Not by a long shot.

715
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:13,759
So, if it feels like your worst day, and I
know that it might for some of you.

716
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,450
Someday it's gonna be a memory.

717
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:19,279
And I and a lot of other people here in this
room right now will do whatever it takes to

718
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,970
help you so that you can sit here and rise
above those ashes and say, wow.

719
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,379
That was a really bad day.

720
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,180
But I got through it.

721
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:30,799
And it is behind me, and I am stronger for
it.

722
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,220
So, I think that's very important to remember
that together we can help one another.

723
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,930
Dust off those embers, take flight and become
stronger together.

724
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:42,290
Because without community and without friends,
we can't do that.

725
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:44,370
We've all got to rise together.

726
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:49,299
Things to remember, of course, you are awesome.

727
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,300
You belong here.

728
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,640
You're not an imposter.

729
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,560
You're worthy of people's time.

730
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,660
You are worthy of respect.

731
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,730
You are worthy of equal pay.

732
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:59,740
You are worthy of understanding of your neurodivergence.

733
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,870
You are worthy of acceptance for your disabilities.

734
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:10,120
You are worthy of erg everything that you
bring table and worth everything and being

735
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,120
respected.

736
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:14,600
Don't think otherwise even for a second.

737
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,600
You are amazing.

738
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:23,009
And you deserve everything in the world that
could ever be offered to you.

739
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:26,790
And everyone here deserves nothing but the
best.

740
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:28,970
Because this is a great community.

741
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:30,520
And together we are wonderful people.

742
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,509
And we are doing wonderful things.

743
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:35,140
And I think that it's only gonna bet better
from here.

744
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:42,930
And I feel like we are going to raise one
another up and set this entire world on fire.

745
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:45,160
Thank you so much for having me today.

746
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,560
If you have any questions, please feel free
to write me on Twitter.

747
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,180
You can email me.

748
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,350
Add me on LinkedIn.

749
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,350
Whatever it may be.

750
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:56,779
And I'll take questions or talk to anybody
for the little bit of time we've got left.

751
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:03,590
And Jasmine can feel free to come back.

752
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:14,140
I can also try to look at the chat.

753
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:18,200
I would like to thank everybody for the opportunity
to be here.

754
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,549
I very much appreciate it.

755
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:27,690
And I'm going to mess around with my setup
for a moment.

756
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,000
Hi, Nicole.

757
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,790
NICOLE: There is there is lots of love and
thank yous and crying happening.

758
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:34,790
RIN: There's crying?

759
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:35,790
Oh, no.

760
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:36,790
I don't want that.

761
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:39,550
I hope it's good crying.

762
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:43,600
NICOLE: I've not located questions yet.

763
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,940
There's too much thank you and crying.

764
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:48,790
RIN: I have to figure out how my second monitor
works.

765
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:50,580
And I have been trying to scroll down to see
chat.

766
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,940
And it's like, what if I didn't?

767
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:56,840
So, I have not been able to see chat this
entire time.

768
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:00,110
I have no idea what anyone is saying.

769
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:04,130
NICOLE: They're literally saying thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you, great talk,

770
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,750
thank you, happy tears.

771
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:08,330
I once exaggerating.

772
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:09,490
It's scrolling very rapidly.

773
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:10,490
RIN: It's a wall?

774
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:11,490
Nice.

775
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:12,490
NICOLE: Yes.

776
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:19,709
If somebody does have a question, please just
start with the word question so I can spot

777
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,710
it.

778
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,020
RIN: That would be great.

779
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,710
I can't see anything.

780
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:26,830
My computer is like, you have two monitors?

781
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:31,480
Are you really giving a talk if your AV doesn't
mess up in a horrible way?

782
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:35,130
NICOLE: Or you have to tape the microphone
to your face.

783
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:36,910
When you're ripping it off, you get hurt.

784
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,509
RIN: I am not joking.

785
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:44,510
My cat has shows up in every important thing
if my life.

786
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:54,060
In my interview with Camunda, he had his claws
in my hair.

787
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,960
And I had to dislodge his foot from my forehead.

788
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,920
He's here to knock over the second monitor.

789
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,920
Recommendations.

790
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:05,510
I have a question.

791
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:12,110
Kayla asks, any other recommendations on how
to fix yourself up when in a rough position?

792
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,710
That's a good one.

793
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:18,210
What I did was honestly focus on anything
that wasn't that rejection cycle.

794
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:19,330
It was candles.

795
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:20,630
It was getting outside.

796
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:23,730
It was going for walks with my dog.

797
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:27,340
Anything that got me off of the Internet and
away from Gmail where I was getting the wall

798
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:29,040
of rejection.

799
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,350
Anything.

800
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:33,279
Another thing I did was get a therapist.

801
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,520
I got on Talkspace, and I got one of those
virtual therapists.

802
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,250
Very helpful, very beneficial.

803
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:43,960
I also looked into CBT and DBT, cognitive
and behavioral therapy.

804
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,300
Always good.

805
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:51,690
Take therapy, do CBT or DBT, whichever works
for you.

806
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:52,730
It depends.

807
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:53,730
Everybody's different.

808
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,500
I recommend therapy.

809
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,440
Talk to somebody.

810
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,290
There's all those virtual therapist programs
now.

811
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:00,290
There's a torn of them.

812
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:01,290
There's so many.

813
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:04,200
There's better help, talk space.

814
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,200
I love Sanvello.

815
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,270
It's really cool.

816
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:10,330
The thing that I used in a combo was Sanvello
and Daylio.

817
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:13,049
Daylio is a mood tracker.

818
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:20,850
And Sanvello
is a full CBT and guided meditation app like

819
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:21,850
headspace.

820
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:26,040
But with a licensed therapist.

821
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,980
That's cool.

822
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:29,980
Really enjoyed that.

823
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:35,070
It's also do I have a neurodiversity ERG at
your current company?

824
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,070
No.

825
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:40,610
But I am absolutely gonna try and start one.

826
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:41,770
It's on my to do list.

827
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:42,770
Trust me.

828
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:43,860
I have thought about it.

829
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:46,280
I am hoping to eventually in the future.

830
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,710
I'm pretty much sure my management team is
watching this.

831
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,090
And they know it's coming.

832
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:54,080
It is not a surprise, oh, the neurodiversity
thing again.

833
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,500
Yes, that.

834
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:00,941
And if you are hoping to start your own diversity
employee resource group, the key thing that

835
00:44:00,941 --> 00:44:06,359
I cannot stress enough is please, please,
talk to your neurodivergent employees.

836
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,720
Don't just start it.

837
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,299
Nothing about us without us.

838
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,700
Please, please, please, talk to the people.

839
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:15,000
Do I prefer ghosting or rejection without
explanation?

840
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,740
I love that.

841
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,479
Best question.

842
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,100
Do I prefer ghosting?

843
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,350
Yes.

844
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:22,350
Ghost me.

845
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:23,350
Please ghost me.

846
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:25,860
I beg of you, never speak to me again.

847
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,950
I absolutely prefer to be ghosted.

848
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:31,660
As opposed to getting rejected after like
12 hours of interviewing.

849
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:33,140
That's way worse.

850
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,400
Just don't talk to me.

851
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,010
Don't follow up, don't send the autoresponder.

852
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:37,010
Just never speak to me.

853
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,010
It's fine.

854
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:41,080
I'll just think it got lost in the void.

855
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,230
It's okay.

856
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:43,950
No hard feelings.

857
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:45,879
I absolutely think that's true.

858
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,880
Yeah.

859
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,100
I totally think that that's way better.

860
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,100
Yeah.

861
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,490
I would absolutely say ghost me for sure.

862
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:54,049
If anybody else prefers actually getting rejected.

863
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:55,050
Wow.

864
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:57,530
You have better you have thicker skin than
I do.

865
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:59,540
Because there were only so many rejections
I could take.

866
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:00,690
That's why I'm giving this keynote right now.

867
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:05,400
I ended up on the point they couldn't take
anymore, and I was sad online and then I met

868
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:09,160
Jasmine and now we are here.

869
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:14,339
NICOLE: I mean, so that one worked out.

870
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,340
Maybe?

871
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,520
RIN: It did.

872
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,520
NICOLE: In the end?

873
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,520
RIN: It did in the end, yes.

874
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:23,509
Because meeting Jasmine got me to the point
to get the platform evangelist, which got

875
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:32,250
me into the Dev Slack, and linked to the job
I have now and applied and interviewed and

876
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:33,250
said job.

877
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:37,160
It all worked out in some serendipitous way.

878
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:40,259
It was very interesting indeed.

879
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,260
NICOLE: All right.

880
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:44,800
It looks like some people are questioning
in the event chat.

881
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,020
RIN: Are they?

882
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,980
NICOLE: Except event chat does not come in
the stage.

883
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:52,780
You have to come to the stage chat.

884
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:55,990
For those that don't know, there's a small
tabby thing.

885
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:58,580
Luckily some people clued us in.

886
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:04,210
So, if your question has not been answered,
you might be in the Ent chat and not the stage

887
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:05,210
chat.

888
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:06,950
So, copy it over here.

889
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:08,779
RIN: Copy it over.

890
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:11,200
I would love to answer your questions.

891
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,299
Put them in the right chat.

892
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,470
I can't access them.

893
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:15,609
They're better off than I am.

894
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:17,380
I can't read anything.

895
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:21,810
NICOLE: For those that don't know, we are
in the magical place called Streamyard which

896
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:23,350
is not Hopin.

897
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:27,850
And we cannot see the other areas of Hopin
that you can see.

898
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:29,940
RIN: Nope.

899
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:32,030
Got nothing.

900
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:34,630
Which is sad, but true.

901
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:37,550
NICOLE: On the other hand, this is way better
than last year.

902
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:39,170
RIN: It is way better than last year.

903
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:40,170
Last year was fun, though.

904
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:42,050
I had a good time last year.

905
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:44,910
It was good.

906
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:45,910
This is getting better.

907
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:49,440
It's one of those things, it's fine line,
it's like agents, you're here.

908
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,440
Like Diana Initiative 2024 is gonna be nice,
nice.

909
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,680
Really nice.

910
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,910
I'm here for it, honestly.

911
00:46:55,910 --> 00:47:01,850
NICOLE: I mean, if the hotel in Vegas could
not charge us an arm and a leg and somebody's

912
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:07,580
first born child for bandwidth, we could probably
do amazing hybrid stuff.

913
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:10,680
RIN: That would be nice, yeah.

914
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,919
NICOLE: That's unlikely because it's Vegas.

915
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,340
RIN: Oh, no!

916
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:16,960
Oh, no!

917
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,690
I'm actually gonna see if I can see the stage
chat really quick.

918
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:22,690
Maybe.

919
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:23,690
Hopefully.

920
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:31,220
I'm gonna mute my own and see if I can.

921
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:34,509
Question, I want
NICOLE: I see one.

922
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:35,510
RIN: Yay!

923
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:36,510
NICOLE: Oh.

924
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:37,510
Yes.

925
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:38,510
RIN: Question, I want to be involved in the
Diana Initiative again.

926
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:39,510
Can I volunteer again?

927
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:40,510
Yes, you can.

928
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:42,050
NICOLE: That's an easy one.

929
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:44,840
RIN: Yes, you can speak.

930
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,420
We're getting lots of volunteers.

931
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:47,420
Yay!

932
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:48,420
Hooray!

933
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:49,420
Wonderful.

934
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:52,230
What a joy.

935
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:54,170
That's fun.

936
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:55,170
That's fun.

937
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:56,780
NICOLE: All right.

938
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:03,700
Well, with that, I think unless you can figure
out how to find the stage chat questions

939
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,439
RIN: I will scroll through.

940
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,270
NICOLE: People have just determined that they
are lost.

941
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:09,640
RIN: They are.

942
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:13,160
I'm gonna see what I've got here going on.

943
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,500
We're going to scroll up a little bit.

944
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,840
Someone said they love Daylio.

945
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:20,630
I love it as well.

946
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:22,900
Daylio is great.

947
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,420
Wonderful, wonderful.

948
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:26,490
Daylio buddies, everyone loves it.

949
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:29,770
Please check, my streak is 526 days.

950
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:30,840
What's the challenge?

951
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,090
Track the moods, see if you're at.

952
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:34,340
Tracking the moods is important.

953
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:41,080
Oh, do I know any InfoSec specific organizations
that advocate for neurodiversity?

954
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,910
Oh, InfoSec specific?

955
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:45,830
Diana Initiative?

956
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:51,090
NICOLE: Kim Crawley
RIN: Yes, DisInfoSec.

957
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:52,090
Yes.

958
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:58,910
NICOLE: Put that into the search engine of
your choice.

959
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:06,529
RIN: Totally, not InfoSec specific, but Mozilla
conference has a track dedicated to neurodiversity.

960
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:07,530
It's great.

961
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:10,960
If you want to get involved with that, it's
awesome.

962
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,310
Recommend.

963
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:13,310
Really cool.

964
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:14,840
Definitely recommend doing that.

965
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:20,570
NICOLE: We have another question for which
I'm going to boop somebody with a noodle.

966
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:23,330
He knows what's coming.

967
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:27,940
He's getting booped with a noodle.

968
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:30,910
No, no, the answer is no.

969
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:31,910
RIN: Yeah.

970
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:32,910
Yeah.

971
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:34,359
I can see you are getting booped with a noodle.

972
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,360
Yeah.

973
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,360
No.

974
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,360
No, no.

975
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,360
But you could!

976
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,360
Very cool, very cool.

977
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,360
NICOLE: Here we go.

978
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,630
So, that is the term.

979
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:44,210
But that term in your search engine of choice.

980
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:46,220
And thank you.

981
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:47,560
RIN: Absolutely.

982
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,560
Absolutely.

983
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,560
Yeah.

984
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,560
Definitely do that.

985
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,560
840 days in Daylio.

986
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,560
Somebody did beat me!

987
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,560
I love it.

988
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:57,660
They are amazing!

989
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:58,700
Wonderful.

990
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,049
I love it.

991
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:02,870
The absolute goal there.

992
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:03,870
Wow.

993
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:04,870
840 days.

994
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:09,930
NICOLE: Look, we even got, for those who don't
the DisInfoSec search engine.

995
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:12,529
RIN: Nice, wonderful, wonderful.

996
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:13,840
Love it.

997
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:19,010
So amazing.

998
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:23,680
On that, I'm going give you 10 minutes of
your life back, Nicole, if you like.

999
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:31,120
NICOLE: I'm going to do the closing counts
so everyone can go to the socials early.

1000
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,120
RIN: Perfect.

1001
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,120
All right.

1002
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,120
Thank you.

1003
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,290
NICOLE: Thank you so much.

1004
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:36,940
And thank you for having all the happy crying.

1005
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:40,070
It was not sad crying, I think
it was all happy crying.

1006
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:41,080
RIN: That's all good.

1007
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,080
Awesome.

1008
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,080
Thank you for having me.

1009
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,080
It was a real pleasure.

1010
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,080
What a delight.

1011
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,080
Thank you very much.

1012
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,191
I will see you

1013
00:50:47,191 --> 00:50:49,250
all again next year.

1014
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,790
NICOLE: All right.

1015
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:54,750
Now I get to scramble and figure out my AV.

1016
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:59,530
Because this is the end of the conference,
right?

1017
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:01,490
All right.

1018
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:02,490
Share.

1019
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:04,419
Ta da!

1020
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:05,420
Yes.

1021
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:07,360
All right.

1022
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,680
We have reached the end.

1023
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:15,660
And for those of you who didn't know why you
were here, we're a diversity focused conference

1024
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:20,730
committed to helping all underrepresented
genders, sexualities, races and cultures in

1025
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:22,840
information security.

1026
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:27,170
And if you didn't notice that is slightly
different than last year.

1027
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:32,660
So, hopefully you like the tweak.

1028
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:36,830
And thank you to all of our sponsors.

1029
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:41,529
For those of you who have never run an event,
you don't know how many different things you

1030
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:44,080
end up needing to purchase.

1031
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:51,930
Mail merging software and scheduling software
and CFP software and I could go on and on

1032
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:54,020
and on and you would be very bored.

1033
00:51:54,020 --> 00:52:00,000
But in order to have this event, and I think
you all had fun based on the chat, we had

1034
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,590
to have all of these sponsors.

1035
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:03,960
And I really appreciate them.

1036
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,810
And in fact, we had even more than that sponsors.

1037
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:07,950
So, there you go.

1038
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:11,060
Can everyone see that Streamyard sharing your
screen thing?

1039
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:12,060
I hope not.

1040
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:14,360
Because it's like blocking some of our sponsors.

1041
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:19,860
Anyway, scroll down to the bottom of the stage,
keep scrolling down, we have the sponsor logos

1042
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:21,020
there.

1043
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:26,390
It's been a rough year.

1044
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:29,080
This is from WHO.

1045
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:34,420
And we're at over 4 million people that we
have lost.

1046
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:37,710
And they didn't really need to be lost.

1047
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:39,910
Because there was a pandemic.

1048
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:45,310
And outside of the pandemic, it's also been
really rough.

1049
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:47,040
There's been breaches.

1050
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:51,590
Zero days that are actually getting exploited.

1051
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:53,230
Ransomware.

1052
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:58,410
People trying to mix different chemicals into
a water system because somebody didn't change

1053
00:52:58,410 --> 00:52:59,970
a password.

1054
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:01,529
You know?

1055
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:06,110
All the stuff that we have to work nights
and weekends.

1056
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:08,860
But we're here.

1057
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:10,240
Together.

1058
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:13,529
1740 of us apparently bought tickets.

1059
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:20,050
For all of the volunteers, some of you had
to buy them twice.

1060
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:21,050
Sorry.

1061
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:22,480
There were some snafus.

1062
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,550
119 people made this event happen.

1063
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:33,260
So, when we say it takes a village, we really
do mean that it takes a village.

1064
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:38,940
Those 119 people did 210 volunteer shifts.

1065
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:45,400
And those shifts are multiple hours in different
places simultaneously.

1066
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:49,070
Some people have been sitting in chairs all
day doing AV.

1067
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:52,140
Some people have been helping you in chat.

1068
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:57,870
Some people have been running around and doing
resume reviews and mock interviews.

1069
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:01,460
So, if you're interested next year, all sorts
of ways you can volunteer.

1070
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:06,410
We had 55 speakers on the main stage.

1071
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:10,009
We had 6 speakers on the career village stage.

1072
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:15,400
And we had 24 speakers in teen village.

1073
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:24,480
Together... the CTF Village had 4 different
CTFs.

1074
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:29,260
And for the TDI Core event, here is the top
ten winners.

1075
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:32,410
I believe this was hosted, yep, on Try Hack
Me.

1076
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:39,520
You should be getting emails if you haven't
already if you're one of the winning persons.

1077
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:43,650
There was also the secure code warrior winners.

1078
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:46,250
And apparently the top three are getting prizes.

1079
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:47,250
Woohoo!

1080
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:50,400
There's a lot of prizes this year for CTF.

1081
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,270
It's exciting.

1082
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:56,830
There was also the CISA and ICS CTF.

1083
00:54:56,830 --> 00:55:01,509
And the top team, this is a team made of,
I don't know?

1084
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:03,190
Is it three people?

1085
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:04,350
I think so.

1086
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:08,770
Sorry, like these notes were literally being
made during the keynote so some are taking

1087
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:09,770
me by surprise.

1088
00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:10,770
I think it's a team of three people.

1089
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:12,759
We're gonna go with that.

1090
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,090
And Marcel says, yes.

1091
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:16,640
The winners are getting emails.

1092
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,220
Yay!

1093
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:22,339
And last but not least, the OWASP DevSlop
winners.

1094
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:25,230
The top five participants are getting prizes.

1095
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:29,360
So, look for emails if you are one of the
people listed there.

1096
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:34,750
We will also Tweet these out in case anyone
is like that slide went by too quickly.

1097
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:38,450
So, congratulations to anyone who played.

1098
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:42,100
Honestly, if you get any flags or know flags
at all.

1099
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,390
CTFs don't need to be really competitive.

1100
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:47,040
I know so†people are really competitive.

1101
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:52,590
But it's about goofing stuff up and breaking
stuff.

1102
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:54,360
We also had IoT Village.

1103
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,790
They were find enough to come here.

1104
00:55:56,790 --> 00:56:02,440
It requires equipment and time and energy
for them to set up all of those labs.

1105
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:08,100
And they hosted their 101 labs which means
you can come in with zero experience and do

1106
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:13,850
a hands on set of things with Internet of
things connected devices and learn all about

1107
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:16,270
them and breaking them.

1108
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:22,460
Over the past two days, 285 lab sessions happened
for a total of 82.5 hours.

1109
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:25,750
That's a heck of a lot of time!

1110
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:29,820
And they will be at DEFCON if you are doing
the DEFCON thing.

1111
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:34,160
So, if you didn't get the opportunity or wanted
to do a little bit more, you can catch them

1112
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,009
there.

1113
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:38,610
Career Village.

1114
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:40,860
They did six talks.

1115
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:42,210
40 or more.

1116
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:43,420
These are approximate the.

1117
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:46,320
Like I said, everyone was scrambling to get
numbers to me.

1118
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:53,630
40 or nor LinkedIn and resume reviews, 17
or more mock and technical interviews.

1119
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:59,610
For those who got that experience, I hope
that it was helpful.

1120
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:02,990
If you ever need more help, please reach out
to us on Twitter.

1121
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:07,669
We know of other events like BSides who also
do similar things and there are some chronic

1122
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:14,160
volunteers with hand raise problems that came
and participated in our Career Village, and

1123
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,540
we do the same for them.

1124
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:19,220
So, you can always get another review if you
had a lot of edits.

1125
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:23,779
So, they also had 16 hours of live AMAs.

1126
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:26,990
Which I believe were pretty hoppin' most of
the time.

1127
00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:28,741
That I guess was a pun.

1128
00:57:28,741 --> 00:57:31,870
I didn't mean it.

1129
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:32,870
Teen Village.

1130
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:34,250
So, this was the first year.

1131
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:36,620
We were trying out something new.

1132
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:39,580
We do send out like feedback things.

1133
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:42,160
So, hopefully we hear from our teens.

1134
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:48,790
The teens that were there got to the Oregon
Trail, AMAs, learn about OSINT, different

1135
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:49,790
career paths.

1136
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:52,330
I mean, honestly, I was kind of jelly.

1137
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:55,130
They also got some really good prizes.

1138
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:58,690
So, overall, I would say: Win!

1139
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:00,650
Nobody died.

1140
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:02,230
Apparently nobody said a curse word.

1141
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:04,040
So, we're calling it victory.

1142
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:08,090
And, of course, Maker Village.

1143
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:12,720
In person I think this is our most physically
popular event.

1144
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:16,640
You usually can't put more people into the
room with Chris.

1145
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,670
And we completely sold out of the PCBs again.

1146
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:20,730
That just proves the point.

1147
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,430
You all like to solder.

1148
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:28,569
Hopefully not burn yourself which is my common
activity when involving a soldering iron.

1149
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:33,850
There is two questions in our main survey
if you missed taking the survey that was posted

1150
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:34,850
on Twitter.

1151
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:37,150
Or you can go take the survey on Twitter.

1152
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:41,300
Or in the village itself about what you would
want next year.

1153
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:45,330
Beyond just the badge blinky things.

1154
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:51,220
So, our Code of Conduct team said there were
three minor incidents.

1155
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:54,180
One thing that they had to keep an eye on.

1156
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:57,540
No one was removed from the conference, but
we did have to mute somebody.

1157
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:59,880
So, one additional thing over last year.

1158
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,430
Overall, not bad.

1159
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:08,819
I really appreciate all of the volunteers
for this team who had to go read all of the

1160
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:09,820
chats.

1161
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:14,410
For anybody who was trying to keep up in the
chats, there's a lot of text going on.

1162
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:19,040
So, they were very busy people and greatly
appreciate that.

1163
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:24,040
So, is everybody ready for 2022?

1164
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:29,600
Well, it's gonna be August 10th through 11th
at the Westin hotel in Las Vegas.

1165
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,930
We already signed the contract.

1166
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:35,910
So, unless something terrible happens, those
are gonna be the dates.

1167
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:39,200
And the tickets are already on sale† on
sale on Eventbrite.

1168
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:45,850
You can get them now if you really to want
to make sure that you get in.

1169
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:47,450
Obligatory reminder.

1170
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:49,049
We're not for profit.

1171
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:50,760
All of us are unpaid volunteers.

1172
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,990
In fact, all of us are you.

1173
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:55,500
So, you can volunteer.

1174
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:56,500
Or donate.

1175
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,500
Or both.

1176
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:03,410
Also, if your company would like to throw
money at us, since we're a nonprofit, we'll

1177
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:05,560
take some 2022 sponsors.

1178
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:12,630
We'll get some packets out there as soon as
possible with some early bird pricing.

1179
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:17,110
If you have feedback specifically for the
speakers.

1180
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:21,360
Go to sched, which is linked on the website.

1181
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:26,090
Or you can go to Sched directly or find it
on Twitter.

1182
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:28,630
Find the talk you want to give feedback on.

1183
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:34,700
Click to see the details and click the survey
feedback link.

1184
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:39,669
That will give you a Google survey with like
four questions.

1185
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:41,400
Answer them.

1186
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:49,150
If there are answers in there, speakers, after
a couple of weeks, I will give you the feedback.

1187
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:51,960
Last year there was not a ton of feedback.

1188
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:56,630
So, if you don't see any feedback and were
wondering if I just fell asleep and forgot,

1189
01:00:56,630 --> 01:00:59,580
you can message me and ask.

1190
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:03,200
But I will try to get these out in a couple
weeks.

1191
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,660
So, feedback about the event.

1192
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:06,740
What went well?

1193
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:08,140
What did not go well?

1194
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:09,940
What ideas do you have for next year?

1195
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:11,550
That's the form.

1196
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:13,540
It's also gonna be on social media.

1197
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:16,610
It's also going to the mailing list and all
the registered attendees.

1198
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:21,240
So, if you can't scrabble down that URL fast
enough don't worry.

1199
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:25,680
Or it looks† John posted it.

1200
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,069
That's the feedback for Rin's talk.

1201
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:30,210
Go do the feedback for Rin's talk.

1202
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:34,800
Also, happy belated International Non binary
People's Day.

1203
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:40,080
It was right before the event, and I forgot
to Tweet.

1204
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:47,250
And for those who didn't know, now you know
for next year and can celebrate.

1205
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:48,880
And this slide kind of makes me mad.

1206
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,260
I shouldn't have to say any of this.

1207
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:56,220
In fact, there's a ton of things that should
be on here that aren't because I can't fit

1208
01:01:56,220 --> 01:02:01,169
them or maybe I have forgotten, or maybe I
don't know about them.

1209
01:02:01,170 --> 01:02:08,240
But TL;DR, can we all just be nice to one
another?

1210
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,390
And respect one another?

1211
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:13,350
So, yes.

1212
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:17,480
This† I don't know what else to say.

1213
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:20,640
Technology is not apolitical.

1214
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,710
Women's rights are human rights.

1215
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:25,920
Nothing about us without us.

1216
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,920
Trans lives matter.

1217
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,320
No human is illegal.

1218
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,920
Black lives matter.

1219
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,780
Stand with Indigenous peoples.

1220
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:41,160
Stop the hate on Asian Americans and Pacific
Islanders.

1221
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,670
Rights not Rescue.

1222
01:02:42,670 --> 01:02:48,310
And pay equity now?

1223
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:53,310
This year our slogan was spark a journey.

1224
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:56,330
We started off with igniting a spark.

1225
01:02:56,330 --> 01:03:04,049
Alyssa let us know that if you are the one
who ignites the flames of your career, you

1226
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:05,460
can't get burned.

1227
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:08,440
You are the flame.

1228
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:15,160
Next, we learned about practicing aggressive
empathy which I think was a new thing that

1229
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,549
was added to all of our vocabulary.

1230
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:24,990
So, if you currently are fired up, offer a
helping hand to your local community.

1231
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:27,430
Your events that you like.

1232
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:29,279
Your workplace.

1233
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,430
Be a mentor.

1234
01:03:30,430 --> 01:03:33,310
You don't have to be the smartest person ever.

1235
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,540
You just have to know a bit more than somebody
else.

1236
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:38,610
Do you have multiple yearsí experience in
a thing?

1237
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:39,940
Check cyber mentoring Monday.

1238
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:43,930
You can probably mentor somebody who has never
done that thing.

1239
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:45,810
Share job opportunities that you see.

1240
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:49,320
Just because you see them, doesn't mean everyone
else in your network has.

1241
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:54,600
Boost the signal for anybody looking for work.

1242
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:58,410
Maybe their network isn't as big as yours.

1243
01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:04,129
Work to create equitable entry level opportunities
if you can at your work place.

1244
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:07,220
Point out, does that have to be a senior position.

1245
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:09,180
Hey, we've got enough seniors.

1246
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:10,879
Can we open a mid level?

1247
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:11,880
Can we open a junior?

1248
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:17,720
Can we do a summer intern?

1249
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,580
Sustain that spark.

1250
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:21,490
Take care of yourself.

1251
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:25,290
Be kind and care for others whenever you can.

1252
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:30,000
As we found out from Steph, you need to make
sure that you set time to assess what matters

1253
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,340
to you.

1254
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:34,360
It's not gonna be what matters to everybody
else.

1255
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:36,510
Figure out what you need.

1256
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:42,000
And when you're interviewing, find an employer
that matches your needs.

1257
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,190
You are interviewing them as much as they
are interviewing you.

1258
01:04:46,190 --> 01:04:49,510
Not everyone can always be that choosey.

1259
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:54,700
But when you can, try to find the best fit
company.

1260
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:59,390
Encourage your workplace to take the Pay Equity
Pledge.

1261
01:04:59,390 --> 01:05:02,810
Everyone should get paid fairly, right?

1262
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:05,009
Be an ally.

1263
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:06,330
This is an ongoing act.

1264
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:08,464
You don't just decide that had you're an ally.

1265
01:05:08,464 --> 01:05:18,170
You try, you make a mistake, you apologize,
you learn from it, you keep going.

1266
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:21,260
Get comfortable with being uncomfortable.

1267
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:27,810
Most of all, if you can boost somebody else,
especially if they're not being heard, boost

1268
01:05:27,810 --> 01:05:28,810
them.

1269
01:05:28,810 --> 01:05:33,299
Instead of talking over them.

1270
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:38,120
So, what if you couldn't sustain your spark
and you lost it?

1271
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:43,319
Well, we just heard what happens when you
need to recover your spark.

1272
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,890
Do whatever you need to do to keep going.

1273
01:05:45,890 --> 01:05:49,230
Pets, plants, candles.

1274
01:05:49,230 --> 01:05:52,700
Find a cheerleader.

1275
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:55,270
Resilience alone is not gonna get you through
it.

1276
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:56,810
Find a community.

1277
01:05:56,810 --> 01:05:59,549
Set boundaries.

1278
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:03,060
And find a way to rise from the ashes.

1279
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:08,850
When your spark grows into a flame, use it
to light the way for others.

1280
01:06:08,850 --> 01:06:12,529
I hope you all join us as our social.

1281
01:06:12,530 --> 01:06:13,540
And we'll see you next year!
