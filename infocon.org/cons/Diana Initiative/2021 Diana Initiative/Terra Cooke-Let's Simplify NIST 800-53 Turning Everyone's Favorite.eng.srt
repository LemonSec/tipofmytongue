where you are so we can talk about nist

44
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,240
one of my favorite topics um so as it

45
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,000
goes my name is tara cook it is july

46

17th and my topic today is let's

47
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,520
simplify nist 853 turning everyone's

48
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,680
favorite publication to digestible bits

49
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,920
and bytes with that i'm going to click

50
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,280
over here to where my slides actually

51
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,079
are and move this thing along so

52
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,640
who am i um again my name is tara cook i

53
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,840
like to

54
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,000
call myself a security magical girl or

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,239
olivia pope without all the mess because

56
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,720
cleaning things up is something that i

57
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,239
do but i also just like saying that i'm

58
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,599
a magical girl because anime um i am a

59
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,760
former still slash kind of sort of still

60
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,760
a governance risking compliance and

61
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,840
audit nerd um that is where a good chunk

62
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,599
of my heart honestly sits i know a lot

63
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,120
of people don't like auditors but we're

64
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,280
great i promise i also used to work in

65
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,800
the intelligence community that is a fun

66
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,080
time and a very quick thing that we

67
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,640
always just like right on over um i am

68
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,280
very unapologetically black and i am

69
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,280
huge on pushing for intersectionality

70
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,519
and equity in the security and tech

71
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,280
world and as i do call out that i am

72
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,599
very black and i think it goes without

73
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,680
saying as far as

74
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,440
what it means to me in my life to always

75
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,360
call out in these forums that black

76
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,040
lives matter and that includes the lives

77
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,800
of black women black trans women black

78
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,440
lgbtq women some adjacent folks women

79
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,720
adjacent folks um and if we have a lot

80
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,480
of work to do as far as dismantling

81
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,159
white supremacy and these things in the

82
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,239
world before we can really make progress

83
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,159
it means a lot to me if you do your part

84
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,840
in making sure that we do that with that

85
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,480
being said i'm going to keep going

86
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,640
so why are we here um we're here to talk

87
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,280
about nist like i said earlier um my

88
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,360
whole goal is to ultimately take this

89
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,200
framework that is very huge and kind of

90
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,360
clunky and this is not me uh knocking

91
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,120
this i love them to death but if you're

92
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,799
starting out in your career and you have

93
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,480
heard about it i think it's a great time

94
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,560
for us to discuss the different family

95
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,799
slash categories what do they mean how

96
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,319
they might show up in your environment

97
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,000
and if you're an auditor how to audit

98
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,519
them although you know it's not bad for

99
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,200
anybody to audit things

100
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,280
answer any questions and you know while

101
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,440
the pandemic is still pandemic

102
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,170
enjoy everybody's virtual company

103
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,440
[Music]

104
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,599
so why should you care about

105
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,159
nist i mean that's at your discretion um

106
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,480
i care about it because it was and has

107
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,159
continued to be very crucial for me in

108
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,000
my career um and even if it's not

109
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,840
directly called out i personally think

110
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,080
that we touch nest 853 or at least

111
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,239
control families on a daily basis and

112
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,519
that's whether you work in security

113
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,560
whether you work in engineering

114
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,959
development et cetera um it's something

115
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,799
that we all touch i think it builds a

116
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,560
solid foundation for your career no

117
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,000
matter again where you're working in

118
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,959
your career and when you go and start to

119
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,880
look through nests and digest it and yes

120
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,478
i have read all i have know how many

121
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,199
pages of it um it helps folks speak a

122
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,440
common language and i think in the world

123
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,520
of security and engineering specifically

124
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,040
speaking a common language is super

125
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,800
important because it gives us

126
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,240
an understanding on how we can move

127
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,280
forward and like i said earlier i think

128
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,960
this is super cool

129
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,960
and so i like talking about it and i

130
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,440
also like talking about uh subjects that

131
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,320
are

132
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,000
that can be very arduous very time

133
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,479
consuming very large um so i think it's

134
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,160
cool and i want to share the goodness

135
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,240
word

136
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,960
so

137
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,440
what is nist 853 i should probably even

138
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,520
start off with saying what does nist

139
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,120
stand for so that is the national

140
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,639
institute

141
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,320
of standards and technology based out of

142
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,240
gaithersburg maryland there's also a

143
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,680
nist here in colorado because that's

144
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,720
where i live

145
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,759
um but it is pretty much nist 853 to be

146
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,479
very specific it is the federal

147
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,039
information systems controls i totally

148
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,800
forgot actually i think i also just

149
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,880
learned in a couple of different

150
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,120
frameworks but it is something used

151
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,120
primarily in federal systems but it

152
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,639
could be good for any industry the way

153
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,120
it's set up is you have a control um

154
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,600
that is being talked about or addressed

155
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,120
and then under there you have different

156
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,360
categories between low medium and high

157
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,120
because again the federal space you can

158
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,639
put that particular classification to

159
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,479
your system and then it has other

160
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,080
specifications to meet that low medium

161
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,039
and high

162
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,320
and ultimately helps increase the

163
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,080
security of information systems again

164
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,080
going back to that low medium high it

165
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,320
does a focus around confidentiality

166
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,560
integrity availability as well as

167
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,320
operational technical and management

168
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,800
controls so covering the cia platform as

169
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,360
well as giving you um a brevity of

170
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,880
different ways to implement controls

171
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,400
because while just doing things at the

172
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,800
technical level is super sweet um it

173
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,479
doesn't always address everything that

174
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,759
you need

175
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,360
but more importantly and as i've said

176
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,080
multiple times um it's a lot process and

177
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,759
a lot to intake and if you are someone

178
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,840
new to security and you're told hey like

179
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,479
here goes nest 853 go have fun um which

180
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,160
is what happened to me you can just be

181
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,440
like

182
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,880
all right i don't even know what to do

183
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,880
with this or where to start so for me i

184
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,319
try and think about my past self and i

185
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,520
think this would have been really cool

186
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,840
to view as a baby security engineer

187
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,080
um so niz has something called control

188
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,560
families and if memory serves correct at

189
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,520
the

190
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,080
rev5 so uh revision five which i think

191
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,160
was super recently it's 20 or 25

192
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,840
families um i probably should have

193
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,960
counted again before i did this

194
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,440
presentation but i didn't anyway those

195
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,520
all are access control awareness and

196
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,440
training auditing and accountability

197
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,840
assessment authorization and monitoring

198
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,680
configuration management continuity

199
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,160
planning identification authentication

200
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,240
incident response maintenance media

201
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,080
protection physical and environmental

202
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,360
protection

203
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,360
planning program management personnel

204
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,039
security personally identifiable

205
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,720
information processing and transparency

206
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,479
which is a whole mouthful

207
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,319
risk assessment system and services

208
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,080
acquisition system and communications

209
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,840
protection system and information

210
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,759
integrity and last but not least supply

211
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,599
chain risk management so like i said

212
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,360
lots of different control families some

213
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,720
of them when you read the name you're

214
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,880
like okay this is pretty straightforward

215
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,199
with what it should mean um some of them

216
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,720
not so much and even still it's always

217
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,960
nice to have a definition to tackle into

218
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,560
something just so you're generally like

219
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,000
okay cool this is what i'm aiming

220
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,479
towards but as you will see as i go

221
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,479
through this actually not everything has

222
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,880
a definition and that's okay because

223
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,440
i put in my slides this definition my

224
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,360
definition and then again some ways you

225
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,520
might see it pop up so let's get this

226
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,280
thing going

227
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,400
access control

228
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,240
so the nist definition is procedures and

229
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,840
controls that limit or detect access to

230
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,000
critical information resources um i will

231
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,360
stop there because then it gives some

232
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,560
different examples on what that could

233
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,240
look like the way i try and look at

234
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,919
access control is understanding who has

235
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,160
access to something and is that well

236
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,280
understanding who has access to

237
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,919
something is that access valid and why

238
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,800
um it's very important to understand is

239
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,120
that access valid and why

240
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,080
uh the reason why i say that is you know

241
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,879
it's great if someone can for instance

242
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,199
you know access your house or access the

243
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,120
back of your yard but should they be

244
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,199
accident accessing it is one thing and

245
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,520
why are they doing it is another um as

246
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,720
you go through and start looking at

247
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,319
different systems as we look at the ways

248
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,440
that it can appear with account

249
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,720
management so you're enabling and

250
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,400
disabling your accounts your lease

251
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,919
privilege which is only giving someone

252
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,159
access to what they need to do their job

253
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,080
and then restricted access so an example

254
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,000
is like hr only being able to see hr

255
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,479
files that ties back into me as a

256
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,399
security engineer i should not have

257
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,200
access to um

258
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,120
anybody's hr files just by the nature of

259
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,120
my job it's not necessary if i happen to

260
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,000
have access though why is it valid so

261
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,240
how deeply can i see someone's files and

262
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,200
why is it important um do i have access

263
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,800
as a security person because i something

264
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,760
um

265
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,760
it was an ungracious person leaving not

266
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,279
on a gracious person believing it was an

267
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,200
unceremonious someone got fired there

268
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,959
boom we can say it like that someone got

269
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,880
fired so do i have access to make sure

270
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,560
that you know everything is closed out

271
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,880
in a certain way or

272
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,399
you know somebody in finance having

273
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,920
access to certain files so on and so

274
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,000
forth um it is very important to

275
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,640
reiterate on that access being valid or

276
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,399
why or thinking about even just like

277
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,880
wi-fi um someone could totally have

278
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,519
access to your wife or your access point

279
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,920
for instance um but did you change the

280
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,000
password to the one that was on the box

281
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,080
so they now don't have valid access and

282
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,000
why they have it is because the password

283
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,560
they knew it and it was easy

284
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,720
um awareness and training oh my gosh i

285
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,320
totally did not change this in my slide

286
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,560
and i'm very ashamed of myself anyway

287
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,360
um

288
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,120
the miss definition i don't remember i

289
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,920
don't think this actually had one um my

290
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,240
definitions of awareness and training is

291
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,160
making sure you train up your people on

292
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,200
you know what they're supposed to be

293
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,040
doing for their job what that can look

294
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,640
like is your security awareness training

295
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,320
which everyone loves i know we do um or

296
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,160
very job specific training so for

297
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,320
instance at my current company um that i

298
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,920
work at we have some secure code

299
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,320
training for our developers available um

300
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,079
and that just helps them you know beef

301
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,640
up their skills around developing secure

302
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,440
code so that's some job training or

303
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,880
um i'm trying to think of some other

304
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,800
ways that it can appear but i think

305
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,720
people understand the gist of awareness

306
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,880
and training please say that i change it

307
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,360
okay great um i was very afraid that i

308
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,800
somehow did not update all my slides or

309
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,000
forgot to

310
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,600
um but auditing an account or excuse me

311
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,680
audit and accountability um nist doesn't

312
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,920
have a definition for that but what that

313
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,680
looks like is who did what when did they

314
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,760
do it and does it make sense so it ties

315
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,519
back into that whole aspect of access

316
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,040
control a little bit if you can't tell

317
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,480
how these things all play off of each

318
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,880
other um ways that that can appear is

319
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,880
event logging so when you see someone

320
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,399
signs in and that's being sent off

321
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,959
somewhere log retention making sure

322
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,959
things are being retained based off of

323
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,480
different obligations you might have

324
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,079
depending on what industry that you work

325
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,519
in and then non-repudiation is a person

326
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,760
like without a shadow of a doubt that

327
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,519
person is who they say they are and can

328
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,160
prove it um so again going back to who

329
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,560
did what when and doesn't make sense the

330
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,480
way i try and think about that is you

331
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,399
know maintenance and you actually see

332
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,320
this coming into a different site as

333
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,959
well um but you want to be able to you

334
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,640
know if you live in an apartment complex

335
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,279
and you submit a maintenance request you

336
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,760
would hope that your complex has you

337
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,399
know some log showing like okay tara

338
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,640
submitted a request yup we got that

339
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,640
request we

340
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,800
submitted it to the maintenance person

341
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,160
um and they're going to be going to

342
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,240
their apartment at xyz time so you can

343
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,160
see when that key was checked out you

344
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,000
know when that person came in it gives

345
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,440
you a warm and fuzzy because you know

346
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,040
when they did it and it does make sense

347
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,959
that that person did it versus if there

348
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,399
were no logs and people were just going

349
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,240
in and out of your apartment willy-nilly

350
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,000
where's the audit and accountability and

351
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,079
especially the accountability part

352
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,000
so assessment authorization and

353
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,399
monitoring and also um i forgot to point

354
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,639
out uh there are abbreviations to each

355
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,560
of these control families so the way a

356
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,320
controller is usually written it will be

357
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,160
ca-1 or ac-1 so on and so forth

358
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,519
depending on how many different controls

359
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,839
are in that family um but then this

360
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,040
definition there isn't one my definition

361
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,120
is your third-party assessments your

362
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,800
system motor assignment and then your

363
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,120
continuous monitoring that you have um

364
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,760
so that can look like

365
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,399
your sock or a seasonization can totally

366
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,160
just forgot what c stands for but soft

367
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,160
not sock as in like

368
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,519
security or

369
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,440
man words are hard on saturday but

370
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,920
whatever sock audits penetration test

371
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,920
remediation plans and then your various

372
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,680
internal scanning whether that's with

373
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,440
nessus or pick your vulnerability tool

374
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,079
of your choice um it's worth pointing

375
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,519
out that when it comes down to the

376
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,040
system owner assignment that's something

377
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,600
that you see a lot in the federal space

378
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,760
so it might not be something that you

379
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,360
see particularly in your environment but

380
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,120
it is always super important to have

381
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,680
owners to your different systems even if

382
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,360
it's just a matter of going back to

383
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,800
accountability and having someone that

384
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,240
you can talk to to say like hey this

385
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,639
thing broke or hey we have this major

386
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,639
problem it's very important to have an

387
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,000
owner to things to talk to

388
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,040
um so configuration management or cm

389
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,560
nist defines that as a collection of

390
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,240
activities focus on establishing and

391
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,920
maintaining the integrity of information

392
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,519
technology products and information

393
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,440
systems through control of processes for

394
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,440
initial initializing changing and

395
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,279
monitoring the configurations of those

396
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,880
products and systems throughout the

397
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,560
system development lifecycle which is a

398
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,440
mouthful and lots of like nice buzzwords

399
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,680
and stuff um the way that i look at it

400
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,279
is establishing baselines and

401
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,120
controlling system changes in a uniform

402
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,040
manner the way you'll see that could be

403
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,480
a change control board which is a group

404
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,399
of people meaning to discuss different

405
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,160
system changes change restrictions

406
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,760
around least privilege so the person who

407
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,279
creates the code may not actually be the

408
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,720
person you know the only person

409
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,800
reviewing it and then pushing it and

410
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,120
then your baseline snapshots too

411
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,800
and so to try to think about that in

412
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,839
like regular world if you happen to live

413
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,240
in a community that has an hoa which i

414
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,760
know everybody totally loves the hoa um

415
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,519
before you can do any changes like to

416
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,600
the outside of your home you usually

417
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,600
have to go talk to the hoa which could

418
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,720
be a change control board right right um

419
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,360
and you have like cookie cutter houses

420
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,120
that all look the same or you all have

421
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,720
like the same sorts of plants so those

422
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,880
things that's controlling your system in

423
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,880
a uniform manner that is establishing a

424
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,279
baseline that we all have to adhere to

425
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,519
and we have to go talk to people before

426
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,279
you can go through and change that so

427
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,560
that's how i like to think about

428
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,639
configuration management in a

429
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,560
non-technical world sense because one of

430
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,120
the other reasons i personally decided

431
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,160
to do this talk was to kind of demystify

432
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,600
some of the things that we talk about

433
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,199
and deal with in security and in

434
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,680
engineering as a whole i personally you

435
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,519
don't have to be a wizard to know

436
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,240
security um a lot of this stuff is very

437
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,000
applicable to our everyday real life

438
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,800
just have to do some fake dangling um to

439
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,880
take it from tech and to things that we

440
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,680
can tangibly touch

441
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,920
um so keep checking along contingency

442
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,160
planning um that is defined as a

443
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,079
management policy or season management

444
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,600
policy and procedure used to guide an

445
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,920
enterprise response to perceived loss of

446
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,079
mission capability

447
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,839
i say it's a player for when poop hits

448
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,959
the fan realistically speaking um i mean

449
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,720
who would have thought that we're almost

450
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,519
a year and a half into a pandemic that

451
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,360
no one probably assumed that we would go

452
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,680
through in our lifetime and so companies

453
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,079
had to very quickly pivot to their

454
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,920
contingency plan to understand how do we

455
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,000
keep functioning now that poop has hit

456
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,600
the pain and everyone has to work from

457
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,839
home and we don't really know what to do

458
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,000
so that's one way that it can appear but

459
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,920
some other ways is a disaster recovery

460
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,680
plan um it's worth calling out that

461
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,839
disaster recovery rolls into contingency

462
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,560
planning and dr very specifically tends

463
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,680
to focus on the technology recovery um

464
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,600
contingency plan incorporates your

465
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,839
people processes and technologies and so

466
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,199
having backups around your people

467
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,120
processes and technologies and a big big

468
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,519
focus on the people part of things and

469
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,360
then doing the business impact analysis

470
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,519
which is dissecting the impact for if or

471
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,600
when something isn't available which

472
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,120
again goes back into understanding

473
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,839
contingencies

474
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,399
um identification and authentication

475
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,240
nist doesn't have a definition i think

476
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,720
about it around who and what who

477
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,720
uh i there's a debra cox song for

478
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,199
anybody who likes deborah cox or r b

479
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,120
especially from the 90s and when she

480
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,000
says

481
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,320
how did you get here nobody's supposed

482
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,240
to be here so who are you and how did

483
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,560
you get here um not to be confused with

484
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,120
are you supposed to actually be here so

485
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,959
identification is very uh

486
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,440
straightforward you are saying yep i'm

487
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,000
this person and then you authenticate

488
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,440
using something like multi-factor

489
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,199
authentication or your secure shell

490
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,120
secure shell and i spilled that wrong

491
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,839
but that's fine so your ssh keys uh

492
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,279
going back to the example about

493
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,920
maintenance um you expect them to have a

494
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,680
badge which is a form of identification

495
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,040
which i know a badge is not always

496
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,560
perfect and things can be spoofed but

497
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,000
that's okay um so you have them identify

498
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,240
themselves and they have access to your

499
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,400
fps or part of me and maintenance person

500
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,319
has access to literally like everyone's

501
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,919
apartment in a building by the nature of

502
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,559
their job so cool great um but are they

503
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,480
actually authenticated to enter your

504
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,400
apartment that's when it becomes

505
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
debatable because that goes into

506
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,240
well is it valid that they're here are

507
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,880
you actually supposed to be here um

508
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,400
access control is super fun and there's

509
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,120
lots of intersections as you can see um

510
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,360
but yeah identifying and authenticating

511
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,039
you can be authenticated to be there but

512
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,480
that doesn't mean that you or you can

513
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,000
have access but doesn't mean that you're

514
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,840
actually authenticated to be doing that

515
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,080
thing

516
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,880
um incident response so nista finds that

517
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,960
as the mitigation of violation of

518
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,400
security policies and recommended

519
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,760
practices

520
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,919
i think it's just a type of response to

521
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,679
poop hitting the fan so

522
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,640
ir can fall under contingency planning

523
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,280
um depending on what sort of thing is

524
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,440
hitting the fan you might go from an

525
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,320
incident to disaster recovery or an

526
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,840
incident to having to run your

527
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,919
continuity plan or

528
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,000
incident to disaster courage continuity

529
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,559
plan it all definitely just depends um i

530
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,799
think a lot of folks lately in the world

531
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,679
have also seen um iron action with all

532
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,240
the different ransomware attacks um that

533
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,679
have been happening so shout out to the

534
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,760
ir teams and adjacent folks who are have

535
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,080
been handling that you're the real mvps

536
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,320
um it can be really long nights or just

537
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,679
following up with some suspicious

538
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,600
activity um like i mentioned it's a

539
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,200
thing that falls up under contingency

540
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,400
planning which is totally cool

541
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,400
maintenance

542
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,720
that is defined by nist as any act that

543
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,919
either prevents the failure or

544
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,520
malfunction of equipment or restores

545
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,840
this operating capability i define that

546
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,320
as just as we have to do maintenance in

547
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,080
real life keeping your systems right and

548
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,720
tight with regular old tune-ups um you

549
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,640
might see that in your environment by

550
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,799
cycling your laptops every three years

551
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:55,919
checking and replacing fire

552
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,679
extinguishers because physical security

553
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,919
is just as important if not more so

554
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,440
and then hiring a professional third

555
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,799
party to check your specialized

556
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,080
equipment

557
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,480
so if you live in a place you have a car

558
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,559
your own human body we all have to do

559
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,880
maintenance on it it's pretty

560
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,320
straightforward to be quite honest

561
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,320
media protection nist did not give a

562
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,720
definition there um i define it as the

563
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,120
safety of your physical media it can be

564
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,480
you know who can actually access your

565
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,720
physical hard drives if you um

566
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,039
have your stuff in a data center whether

567
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,559
that's networking equipment physical

568
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,720
hard drives etc um destroying your

569
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,559
physical media when you're done with it

570
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,120
so thinking back to good old cds um

571
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,880
destroying them in whatever way shape

572
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,600
form or fashion or also marking media

573
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,280
with proper classification this is

574
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,880
another thing that's super big in the

575
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,520
federal space um obviously making sure

576
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,360
it has its proper classification whether

577
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,640
that's you know secret top secret

578
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,120
whatever and then also following through

579
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,360
on whatever procedures it takes to

580
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,960
remove that data from that physical

581
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,039
media storage but even in the

582
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,280
non-federal space if you are putting

583
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,840
like phi for instance on any sort of

584
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,440
physical media you do want to make sure

585
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,799
that one

586
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,120
it is classified as such and two you are

587
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,360
destroying that physical media or

588
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,200
getting rid of it whether it's

589
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,799
whatever way that works in your

590
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,240
environment you are following that

591
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,640
process

592
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,039
um physical and environmental protection

593
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,039
something that is huge and massive and

594
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,240
often not

595
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,320
looked over versus me it's often not

596
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,000
talked about enough and very much looked

597
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,080
over um this does not have a definition

598
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,480
for that but i view it as protecting

599
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,919
your physical space and ensuring your

600
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,480
safety um when we talk about physical

601
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,240
security obviously the first thing that

602
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,919
comes to mind and is the most important

603
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,840
is the physical security of your people

604
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,159
and so that's something to always bear

605
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,520
in mind when you're talking about your

606
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,919
physical security controls um ways that

607
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,120
might be able to appear in your

608
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,039
environment is having visitor logs

609
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,120
whether that's them just signing a paper

610
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,880
using a system where they you know get

611
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,159
their picture taken and then you have a

612
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,440
record that way

613
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,159
um your cameras your fences your locks

614
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,480
and then also

615
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,000
getting that regular maintenance on

616
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,400
understanding your power your um heating

617
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,320
and cooling fire protection so your fire

618
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,880
extinguishers uh obviously physical

619
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,799
security is important in every aspect of

620
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,880
life not just something that

621
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,080
you should look at when you're in your

622
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,840
office environment and especially with

623
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,760
the whole work from home life thing it

624
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,400
also has caused people to take a way

625
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,960
deeper look into physical security um at

626
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,640
the individual level as well as the

627
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,400
company level especially depending on

628
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,120
what your industry

629
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,559
i'm is

630
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,080
my favorite thing or one of my favorite

631
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,919
things so mr scott give us a definition

632
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,080
of that but that's cool um i think it's

633
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,240
laying down your foundations document

634
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,919
and account for all of the things and

635
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,679
there's a little caveat there obviously

636
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,360
you can't document for all the things i

637
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,400
think if we could um some of us would

638
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,320
depending on how your brain works around

639
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,640
planning um so document you for as many

640
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,440
things that make sense and as possible

641
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,960
you're gonna miss things that's totally

642
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,440
okay um as well as thinking about like

643
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,120
planning in your company of what you're

644
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,960
doing for the next quarter the next half

645
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,120
next year et cetera um the way that i

646
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,400
can totally appear though is different

647
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,480
types of policies your company rule

648
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,200
books and like i mentioned literally

649
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,280
planning for your projects or what have

650
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,760
you

651
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,280
program management near and dear to my

652
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,880
heart because that is a function that i

653
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,960
work in right now um this does not give

654
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,440
a definition there but the way i think

655
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,679
of it is executing projects in opera

656
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,200
opera and

657
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,880
never say the word even though i always

658
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,200
put it in my slides that o word um

659
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,080
improvements at scale um a little bit of

660
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,640
a star at scale because

661
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,640
what you can do in a small space you may

662
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,400
not be able to do as your team or

663
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,480
company starts to grow so it's always

664
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,919
great to have

665
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,159
processes in place that you can

666
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,080
hopefully expand upon as you start to

667
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,039
grow

668
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,480
ways that can appear as a program

669
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,000
management office

670
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,440
your key performance metrics or

671
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,039
indicators or

672
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,600
um your objectives and key results aka

673
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,760
okrs which is something that is super

674
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,840
near and dear to my heart right now um

675
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,039
and then your enterprise-wide and

676
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,200
cross-functional initiative so

677
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,039
your security awareness training your

678
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,559
continuity planning because that is

679
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,559
something that needs to be done in every

680
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,400
part of your company that ultimately

681
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,720
supports your enterprise um those sorts

682
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,360
of things definitely benefit from having

683
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,799
groups of people that work together that

684
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,880
understand a fundamental process that

685
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,799
can hopefully be you know done at the

686
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,360
enterprise and then also um shared

687
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,840
downwards

688
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,080
personnel security uh nist defines that

689
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,600
as the discipline of assessing the

690
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,679
conduct entirety judgment loyalty

691
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,919
reliability and stability of individuals

692
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,360
for duties and responsibilities

693
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,280
requiring trustworthiness

694
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,600
short definitions know your people and

695
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,039
who you're hiring in the grand scheme of

696
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,679
things obviously depending on where you

697
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,679
work or what industry you work

698
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:48,799
that

699
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,039
means a lot of different things but most

700
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,400
places will do something like a

701
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,480
background check having on-boarding and

702
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,400
off-boarding procedures and then having

703
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,480
safe reporting channels

704
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,400
obviously it's important to know um

705
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
people and who you're hiring and whatnot

706
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,400
but there are still fine lines to make

707
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
sure people are having their own privacy

708
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,559
in the world um so again depending on

709
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,240
what industry you're in this could look

710
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,760
like a tool like a bunch of different

711
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,919
things but it's so important to do

712
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,240
um personally identifiable information

713
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,320
also known as pii processing and

714
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,120
transparency or pt this does not have a

715
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,880
definition um my definition is

716
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,120
protecting sensitive information from

717
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,559
those who shouldn't have it i know um

718
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,480
part of this battle which is really hard

719
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,400
is just defining what is sensitive

720
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,320
information or defining what is

721
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,880
personally identifiable information

722
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,400
um something like a name could totally

723
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,039
be pii um but then when you start to

724
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,039
aggregate certain information on people

725
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,880
so you have first name last name email

726
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,880
address ip address phone number so on

727
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,720
and so forth um it starts to become a

728
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,679
way bigger deal so that is helped by

729
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,240
defining a data classification policy

730
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,679
and procedures

731
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,120
having your internal and external

732
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,799
privacy notices for those who may use

733
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,720
your product or in general and then

734
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,960
having end user consent records in logic

735
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,000
logging um thinking about the great gdpr

736
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,919
of

737
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:11,919
2017-2018 put a huge focus on personally

738
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,520
identifiable information for people

739
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,360
obviously who live in the eu but i think

740
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,279
it caused a lot of companies to actually

741
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,720
take a step back and start looking at

742
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,200
the privacy of their consumers and going

743
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,720
through the process of understanding

744
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,799
what is pii and what protections are we

745
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,480
going to put around it as well as the

746
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,000
processing of that information who's

747
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,640
able to access it internally externally

748
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,919
um and what they're ultimately doing

749
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,000
with it so yay for better privacy

750
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,720
controls i'm a huge huge component of

751
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,480
that

752
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,799
uh risk assessment nis has a definition

753
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,559
that is pretty long but it is the

754
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,720
process of identifying risk and

755
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,320
organizational operations such as

756
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,880
including mission function missions

757
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,720
functions image reputation

758
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,720
organizational aspects individuals other

759
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,720
organizations and the nation which is a

760
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,880
huge sign that this is a federal thing

761
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,559
um resulting from the operation of an

762
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,640
information system the way i look at it

763
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,279
and this is a lot shorter to me is do we

764
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,720
want to do a thing if so what's the

765
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,880
impact of that thing uh thinking about

766
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,720
that obviously in your company do you

767
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,159
want to push out a certain change do you

768
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,679
want to do a certain feature if we do

769
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,520
this what's going to be the impact of it

770
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,200
um is it going to have an impact to us

771
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,400
as a company is it going to have an

772
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,240
impact to our consumers are we

773
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,559
potentially opening up a security risk

774
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,799
here if someone you know

775
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,360
actually or let me rephrase

776
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,120
from a security standpoint are we

777
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,760
opening up or increasing the threshold

778
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,799
of which a threat might take place or

779
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,200
um a vulnerability could be acted upon

780
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,640
and then we have a problem

781
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,400
um but you can totally put risk in a

782
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,919
risk register which is something where

783
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,080
all risks are documented and reviews

784
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,159
reviewed have a business impact analysis

785
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,320
or privacy impact analysis

786
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,799
um i think a lot of people get scared

787
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,320
when they think about risk and risk

788
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,320
assessments or that you need to be like

789
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,400
super specialized to do it

790
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,760
i don't think that's the case in all

791
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,720
actuality we do a lot of risk work in

792
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,880
our everyday lives for instance if you

793
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,039
drive a car or if you take a bus lift

794
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,440
what have you um you're doing a risk

795
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,200
assessment in your head then it's do i

796
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,559
want to take my car do i want to take

797
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,880
the bus well i have insurance for my car

798
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,120
so if i get into the accident like the

799
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,640
risk of me having to pay a bunch of

800
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,640
money depending on the different ways

801
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,080
that your insurance is set up could be

802
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,159
minimized or should be minimized well if

803
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,840
i take a bus and something happens then

804
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,919
i just have to get off the bus hopefully

805
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,000
and like everything's cool right right

806
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,279
right so

807
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,279
or again during the pandemic we all had

808
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,960
to do risk assessment literally on a

809
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,880
day-by-day basis of do i go see this

810
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,240
person or no do i stay in my house do i

811
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,679
go get groceries do i have my groceries

812
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,559
delivered to me um not to be super do me

813
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,640
and gloomy about the pandemic but

814
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,720
again i think risk assessments are

815
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,559
something that we should talk about a

816
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,640
lot more as people because we do them a

817
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,120
lot it's just a matter of translating

818
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,159
the

819
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,440
doing the opposite of what i mentioned

820
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,440
before and taking the tangible things we

821
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,760
can touch and put them in a cyber

822
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,440
digital bits and boots sort of space

823
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,720
system services and acquisition so this

824
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,399
does not have a definition of that the

825
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,159
way i look at it is assessing a system

826
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,240
or a service or a company before merging

827
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,880
environments or acquiring them so again

828
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,720
emerging environments or what have you

829
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,320
uh the way that that can appear is the

830
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,760
security or privacy assessment

831
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,600
pre-acquisition understanding their

832
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,440
system and engineering principles doing

833
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,440
documentation reviews um this is a

834
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,880
pretty huge deal in the grand scheme of

835
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,919
things especially if you're going

836
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,919
through an acquisition um if you're

837
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,600
going to treat that company as kind of

838
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,440
like its own little separate thing

839
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,200
that's super cool um but you still want

840
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,640
to understand what's going on in their

841
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,840
environment especially if you're going

842
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,760
to be responsible for it if you're going

843
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,520
to be acquiring them and actually doing

844
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,159
a like a true merge of environments you

845
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,320
do want to understand how that is going

846
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,679
to impact things and how much your

847
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,200
environment is ultimately going to

848
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,799
change and again what sort of um

849
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,880
security threshold that security

850
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,399
threshold um

851
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,799
space are you now opening up by merging

852
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:00,080
the two environments together

853
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,520
i think i'm pretty close to the end i

854
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,520
think i'm also good on time um but

855
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,200
sesame communications protection this

856
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,120
does not have a definition there um the

857
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,960
way i look at it is allowing systems to

858
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,799
speak to each other but from a distance

859
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,320
so virtual social distancing um that can

860
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,919
be viewed as boundary protection so

861
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,760
keeping your sensitive resources behind

862
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,840
a protected wall of sorts i'm having

863
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,799
trusted past so systems that have been

864
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,559
vetted by the engineers say like yep

865
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,240
they can totally talk to each other and

866
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,000
then your public key infrastructure aka

867
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,360
the pki internship or pkis um also

868
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,880
something that's super important when

869
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,640
you start to think about federal systems

870
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,480
of course but it's another form of

871
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,919
access access control in the grand

872
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,360
scheme of things but it's no longer the

873
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,440
focus on the human accessing things but

874
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,440
systems actually being able to access

875
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,039
each other transfer information to one

876
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,000
another etc

877
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,679
then you have system information excuse

878
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,679
me system and information integrity

879
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,520
there's no definition from this but i

880
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,440
think it's maintaining system reputation

881
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,360
and trustworthiness that can be done by

882
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,640
doing your vulnerability scanning and

883
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,960
monitoring having remediation plans and

884
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,720
then doing input validation which is

885
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,399
ensuring someone's input won't break the

886
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,840
system and accidentally display certain

887
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,039
information

888
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,640
it's also thinking about if you're going

889
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,640
to a website for instance and it has

890
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,200
that angry like oh this is http excuse

891
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,679
me http there's no https are you sure

892
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,039
you want to go to this website it

893
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,720
doesn't seem safe

894
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,799
that is a sort of system um

895
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,640
in my opinion system and integrity

896
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,480
system and information integrity you're

897
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,919
letting the person on the other end know

898
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,520
like hey some things might not be

899
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,320
completely like cool um and so it's up

900
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,679
to us to make sure we go through the

901
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,200
processes to make sure that that

902
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,120
integrity is still in place and intact

903
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,720
and it's trustworthy in the grand scheme

904
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,039
of things

905
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,960
i think subscribers change management is

906
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,520
my last one um so cool no this

907
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,159
definition here no big deal um the way i

908
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:47,919
look at it is trusting where you obtain

909
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,760
your products from um you don't want to

910
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,360
buy something that you already know

911
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,440
could be faulty or could have um

912
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,000
potential back doors in it

913
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,760
you can get a risk assessment or do a

914
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,200
risk assessment so thinking a lot about

915
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,120
vendor management for instance that

916
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,880
could technically fall under a sort of

917
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,039
supply chain risk management i'm so

918
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,120
doing that due diligence there i'm

919
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,480
looking at your terms of services and

920
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,320
agreements reading those being thorough

921
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,919
with that and in your contracting

922
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,679
process as a whole

923
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,080
again to make sure that you are

924
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,799
not accidentally um signing things that

925
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,519
could ultimately poke holes in your

926
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,720
system security when they literally just

927
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,880
got it which is not the best thing but

928
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,440
there are also ways around that

929
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,039
so with that that is literally all i

930
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,880
think 20 or 25 different control

931
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,760
families at like lightning speed and i

932
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,279
had not been looking at questions but i

933
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,559
am going to pop over and look at

934
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:43,279
questions in a moment um but if you want

935
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,440

follow me on the social medias i talk

943
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,559
about a lot of different stuff up there

944
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,480
that is totally not all security related

945
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,320
but i'm there

946
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,320
um for my references i want to say thank

947
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,159
you so much to the

948
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,039
woc in tech chat for all of my stock

949
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,720
photos that have lovely pictures of

950
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,480
black women doing the thing in tech it

951
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,880
brings me so much joy obviously i also

952
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,679
use nist 853 as well as in this glossary

953
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,039
to try and pull my definitions from

954
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,640
and i want to say thank you thank you to

955

00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,600
thank you to my team who blasted this on

957
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,840
the twitters and social medias and at

958
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,919
work um i want to say thank you to the

959
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,600
diana initiative for giving me a chance

960
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,919
to do this chat i very much appreciate

961
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,640
the shot um and i also want to plug

962
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,480
since i'm here that my company that i

963
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,279
work at is hiring um if you go to gusto

964
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,200
gusto.com

965
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,960
careers and i'll put that in the chat

966
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,399
not only are we hiring throughout the

967
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:53,760
company as a whole and throughout

968
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,840
engineering but the security team is

969
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,840
hiring quite a bit i think we are

970
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,279
actually hiring on each security team

971
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,760
that we have so would love to talk to

972
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,960
you about our different roles that we

973
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,760
have love to talk to you about

974
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,760
whatever um again so yeah that that's me

975
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,240
and i really did go to count by 30

976
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,120
minutes so i'm super great um but yeah

977
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,200
i want to look at things so brie i don't

978
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,600
i am going to try and scroll through the

979
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,559
chat

980
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:25,640
really fast

981
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,760
[Music]

982
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,600
hey i've been paying attention to chat

983
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,559
here on the side um so one of the first

984
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,679
questions that was asked uh was if a

985
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,559
company doesn't have a grc team

986
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,799
what's the best way to get about uh

987
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,720
starting that up

988
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,640
that is a great question i think a lot

989
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,039
of it comes down to also making sure

990
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,360
when talking about grc it's are you

991
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,919
talking about grc from a strict security

992
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,080
standpoint or is it going to be grc at

993
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,159
the company level once you kind of have

994
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,519
that cleared out a little bit and i'll

995
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:58,880
talk about it for the sake of security

996
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,919
because this is a security conference um

997
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,799
going through and trying to almost do a

998
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,880
risk assessment to understand what is

999
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,199
most important to the company i mean

1000
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,119
what's most important to your security

1001
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,040
team and then understanding what

1002
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,719
industry that you're in so if you work

1003
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,879
in the healthcare industry for instance

1004
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,599
going through and understanding what

1005
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,599
hipaa compliance and i put it quotations

1006
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:22,960
around it because there is technically

1007
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,599
no such thing as hipaa compliance um but

1008
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,440
that's neither here nor there um but

1009
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,040
understanding what hipaa is actually

1010
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,520
asking for and modeling controls around

1011
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,560
that

1012
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,639
so you can go through that and do the

1013
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,159
same thing with nist and looking at the

1014
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,918
different control families and say okay

1015
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,040
cool if ac one which i know what ac one

1016
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,879
is which is access control one is saying

1017
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,359
do you have an access control policy

1018
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:46,239
um

1019
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,000
and you can start in that route and just

1020
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,839
kind of understanding like what are the

1021
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,119
things what are the problems that i'm

1022
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,040
trying to solve for in a security

1023
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,760
standpoint and start building controls

1024
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,119
around that

1025
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,520
and like using this as a reference point

1026
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,520
hopefully that helped i'm so sorry

1027
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,280
that's kind of like my scattered brain

1028
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,960
googly answer

1029
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,560
yeah as another point to that question

1030
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,400
let's say they want to focus on using uh

1031
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,400
nist 853

1032
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,839
uh any starting points or any

1033
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,920
recommendations for them and such

1034
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,960
because i know that's kind of like you

1035
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,480
have to get a team then you have to have

1036
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,920
some folks kind of start driving

1037
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,599
adaptation and everything especially

1038
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:20,960
with leadership and everything else so

1039
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,720
it's very much a multi-prong battle

1040
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,160
there

1041
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,000
if i were trying to i don't want to be

1042
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,680
like go read it because i literally do

1043
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,440
this talk so people don't have to go

1044
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,480
read it

1045
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,760
um

1046
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,180
i would actually say still

1047
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,320
[Music]

1048
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,000
nests always i ask you to start with

1049
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,200
policies and i falter on that policies

1050
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,400
are cool but you shouldn't create

1051
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,160
policies for the sake of like you

1052
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,599
shouldn't create policies that you can't

1053
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:46,880
actually adhere to that's what i'm

1054
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,000
trying to say

1055
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,520
i don't know i'm just going to say i

1056
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,960
don't know to be quite honest which is

1057
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,880
not the best answer

1058
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,240
but if you want to add me on social

1059
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,359
media because now i'm probably going to

1060
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:56,640
think about this for the rest of the day

1061
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,520
you know

1062
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,040
it's always organization specific

1063
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,960
depending on your verticals and your

1064
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,800
business needs and everything else and

1065
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,800
your leadership structure so there's not

1066
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,720
one size fits all i imagine for this

1067
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,760
type of stuff especially when you're

1068
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,960
trying to apply to an entire

1069
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,040
organization that sorry in motion has

1070
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,640
its own things going on there at that

1071
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,800
point um someone else said ask there's a

1072
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,800
quick question uh were you gonna be uh

1073
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,400
sharing slides for this or would they be

1074
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,480
available elsewhere i am gonna share my

1075
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,240
slides um that is something that i have

1076
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,079
been waiting to do until i finish this

1077
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,560
one presentation so literally probably

1078
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,599
today i am going to upload them onto my

1079
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,280
linkedin and i will try and find other

1080
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,200
places to also share them because then i

1081
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,040
think that could address the the first

1082
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,880
question of hey if you want to read

1083
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,320
through the slides and try and assess

1084
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,000
what makes the most sense for you on

1085
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,160
where to start then we could totally

1086
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,400
totally do that

1087
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,720
yeah um so we had a handful of other

1088
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,880
questions here uh towards the bottom of

1089
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,599
the chat um disc 853 recommends

1090
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,320
monitoring does it provide guidance on

1091
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,079
how to go about monitoring systems

1092
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,599
i do believe nist does go about actually

1093
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,920
saying like how to monitor systems

1094
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,079
themselves um it's been a while since

1095
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,200
i've actually pulled through the system

1096
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,440
and monitoring because i've gotten

1097
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,359
i've gotten away from using this as much

1098
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,000
as my starting point and now i have like

1099
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,400
years of experience um to go through

1100
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,359
like ah this is what should be

1101
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:18,560
monitoring for

1102
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,640
nist does index a lot when saying like

1103
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,359
if you have a low system this is what we

1104
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,680
would like to see um if you had like an

1105
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,960
auditor come in so the short answer is

1106
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,839
yes or i guess it's almost clarifying on

1107
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,400
my end you know like oh hey carla

1108
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,480
oh geez carla sorry this is my co-worker

1109
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,680
who's asking this uh

1110
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,400
so yes it does give some guidance on it

1111
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,320
and it is beneficial to have but we

1112
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,480
could totally talk about this at work

1113
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,160
yeah

1114
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,079
yeah like i'm used to pci compliance and

1115
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:51,599
everything having some very in the weeds

1116
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:52,960
definitions about hey you should be

1117
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,560
doing this and that not telling exactly

1118
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,839
how to implement it but giving some

1119
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,040
guidelines of what you should be going

1120
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,040
towards and such so i honestly wasn't

1121
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,920
sure on this side uh james asked uh when

1122
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,520
the company is the supply chain for a

1123
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,440
dod product and it's required to follow

1124
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,520
this but refuse to do so what's the best

1125
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,839
path to take and that's a multi-factor

1126
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,920
question there like that's a loaded

1127
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,200
question

1128
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,720
um

1129
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,599
let me clarify by saying i no longer

1130
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,599
work for the department of defense i

1131
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,160
cannot speak on dod's behalf i cannot

1132
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,280
speak on anyone's behalf but myself if i

1133
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,520
were in this boat and

1134
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,040
a particular vendor does not want to

1135
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,320
follow do you uh excuse me nist guidance

1136
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,480
go find another vendor um that's my

1137
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,960
personal thing like i'm always team like

1138
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,800
if i have hard requirements or things

1139
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,800
that i need and they won't follow it

1140
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,640
i'll go find someone else if it's the

1141
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,400
rare instance like they're somehow the

1142
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,640
only vendor who can do this one

1143
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,400
particular thing it becomes having a

1144
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,480
conversation to be like look

1145
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,800
we gotta meet each other halfway um

1146
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,720
which sucks and it causes a lot of

1147
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,880
heartache and heartburn and talking and

1148
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,200
feelings but realistically if you can go

1149
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,480
find another vendor who's actually

1150
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,480
willing to follow what you need in your

1151
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,839
supply chain process your vendor

1152
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,200
management process risk management

1153
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,920
process etc um go do that it's also kind

1154
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,599
of weird and red flaggy when some

1155
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:10,960
companies are like i'm just not going to

1156
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,720
do this thing it's like

1157
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,000
where are you hiding like why won't you

1158
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,760
do this thing um

1159
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,560
but that's again a very loaded

1160
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,839
multi-faceted question i don't work for

1161
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,359
dod anymore and i can't speak on

1162
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,079
anybody's behalf of my own

1163
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,240
uh i see a number of other

1164
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,440
comments in but no explicit questions i

1165
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,359
i do have a handful of questions i had

1166
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:32,880
uh kind of come to mind while i was

1167
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,320
watching the presentation such if you

1168
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,000
want sure

1169
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,400
sure so um at several points during it

1170
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,079
um you like this isn't actually having

1171
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,119
like an explicit definition um for this

1172
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,280
or that uh any particular reasons or is

1173
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,560
there adjacent documents that might

1174
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,119
contain definitions because uh all those

1175
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,800
types of things i don't know why they

1176
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,240
don't have definitions it's actually

1177
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,079
quite fascinating to me when i was going

1178
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:55,599
through and like putting in the slide

1179
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,000
deck i was expecting to see a lot more

1180
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,400
definition um and i think that does

1181
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,839
point back to

1182
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,599
like me saying speaking a common

1183
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,839
language is so important in engineering

1184
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,079
insecurity because if you don't have

1185
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,520
that definition then everyone's kind of

1186
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,960
like rummaging in their head to

1187
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,040
understand well what does supply chain

1188
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,400
risk management mean

1189
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,839
um

1190
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,839
i didn't even bother to try and like

1191
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,440
google different definitions that are

1192
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,040
specific to engineering and security um

1193
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,200
but yeah i don't know why this doesn't

1194
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,960
have it and i again i'm not bashing this

1195
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,480
i love this it's still one of my dream

1196
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,160
goals to work with them one day they

1197
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,000
like tweeted me on twitter at once and

1198
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,480
it was super exciting um

1199
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,880
yeah did i actually answer your question

1200
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,720
oh yeah no i was actually going to ask

1201
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,720
as a follow-up to that is there any

1202
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,520
uh news documents or other um things

1203
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,640
that you'd include like in your

1204
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,240
reference section that would be like a

1205
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,240
good compliment to understanding this

1206
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,160
particular section of nist any good

1207
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,560
resources or such century the nist cyber

1208
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,880
security frameworks in this csf is

1209
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,040
something that i could actually totally

1210
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,240
be a great starting point um for people

1211
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,119
who want to focus strictly on security

1212
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,200
and the focus is not so much like

1213
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,400
federal stuff nist csf is like great for

1214
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,640
any company that just wants to have like

1215
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,800
a pretty solid security framework um

1216
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,560
there's only like five areas in it so

1217
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,319
that's already better like five versus

1218
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:19,040
twenty some odd control panels

1219
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,119
i forget what all five of them are which

1220
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,560
like makes me so sad because i used to

1221
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,200
remember like all things but then life

1222
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,839
um but it talks about like starting with

1223
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,839
identification like you have a hard time

1224
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,480
knowing what to do in any system any

1225
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,400
place anything if you don't even know

1226
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,640
like what you have there so i think it

1227
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,400
goes identification i'm not even going

1228
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,839
to try and do it right now and embarrass

1229
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:43,440
myself um but i totally recommend um

1230
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,280
then this cyber security framework

1231
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,440
there's also the nist risk management

1232
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,839
framework and i forget um

1233
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,520
the

1234
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,520
the number that goes along with it but

1235
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,160
it's also pretty solid as far as

1236
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,599
like how to walk yourself in your

1237
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,040
company or your team what have you

1238
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,359
through the risk management process

1239
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,040
and try and get an understanding of a

1240
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,280
foundation instead of

1241
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,280
i think to a certain degree doing risk

1242
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,960
assessments are okay being overly

1243
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,400
simplistic but if you want something

1244
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,599
that's actually more robust um the risk

1245
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,040
management framework is also pretty

1246
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,920
solid and i think rain has also been

1247
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,839
like putting different things in there

1248
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:22,800
and i'm also going to plug

1249
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,319
my career

1250
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:25,760
stuff because that's what i was getting

1251
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,359
please do

1252
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:28,160
um

1253
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,040
yes 830 thanks mimi

1254
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,359
we're hiring there's there's a link in

1255
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,280
the chat where you could totally

1256
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,440
oh this is so cool it's so cool seeing

1257
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,160
that little avatar there sorry

1258
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,400
uh so there was an uh two other question

1259
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,440
in chat uh and do you think it matters

1260
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,200
if you follow nist or say yes and i

1261
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,960
think it's more retrospective of does it

1262
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,319
really matter or which one you follow as

1263
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:51,520
long as you're kind of following one of

1264
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,200
them and getting towards a bit more

1265
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,640
secure goal and such

1266
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,880
so i will say something

1267
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,720
possibly spicy considering i'm sitting

1268
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,400
here talking about this you don't

1269
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,920
necessarily have to follow any of these

1270
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,160
like ultimately putting in security

1271
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,200
controls

1272
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,359
what matters is what you're doing works

1273
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:08,960
for your company

1274
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,920
this might be over like overly uh

1275
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,400
complicated or just like doing the most

1276
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,079
cis might not be addressing what you

1277
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,400
need and you can take and pick what you

1278
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,480
want out of these i think also between

1279
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,560
this and cis they're technically kind of

1280
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,520
addressing two separate things um

1281
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,359
if memory serves correct like cis

1282
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,560
because i've looked at it in a while and

1283
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,960
i'm the worst like focuses a lot on

1284
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,760
vulnerability type stuff for me versus

1285
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,920
nist which is kind of a crap shoot of a

1286
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,319
lot obviously um

1287
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,160
oh there's dogs outside of my house i'm

1288
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,520
so sorry i got tired

1289
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,440
um

1290
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,960
i don't think it really matters which

1291
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,960
one you follow if you don't even use

1292
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,800
this or cis and you decide to use some

1293
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,800
different framework okay cool

1294
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,839
um

1295
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,359
it's great

1296
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:56,960
whatever works for you as a company

1297
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,200
gotcha and i think we had one last

1298
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,040
question here of uh

1299
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,880
uh what's your opinion on moving away

1300
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,480
from calling things controls and using

1301
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,440
the term safeguards instead

1302
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,440
i actually like calling them safeguards

1303
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,040
controls has a

1304
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,359
has a very stern

1305
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,280
feeling to it and i think that can scare

1306
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,920
people but at the same time oh yes nist

1307
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,680
and cis also do map to each other i'm

1308
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,599
actually reading the um

1309
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:22,480
uh

1310
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,520
the

1311
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,440
comments wow words are really hard and i

1312
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,520
need to do more morning stuff um when

1313
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,160
i'm in my best like form but anyway

1314
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,079
it would be nice to call them safeguards

1315
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:33,920
control has a very stern feeling to it

1316
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,520
control makes it sound like you have to

1317
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,160
do these things um and obviously

1318
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,520
depending on

1319
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,680
if you're working in dod and you're

1320
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,079
trying to do certain things and get

1321
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:46,240
systems put online then yet some of the

1322
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,599
stuff you're definitely going to have to

1323
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:50,960
do in order to patch those thresholds um

1324
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,000
i'd be open for safeguards that's all uh

1325
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,319
someone else oh cat put guardrails um

1326
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,079
there's options

1327
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,240
i think it also kind of just depends on

1328
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,599
whatever makes you feel the most warm

1329
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,760
and fuzzy on the inside i'm so used to

1330
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,920
calling them controls for my my audit

1331
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,640
life where it's just second nature to me

1332
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,000
and it also isn't as uh do me and gloomy

1333
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,680
as it once was because a lot of people

1334
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,839
will say what what's the spirit of the

1335
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:19,599
control what what's the spirit of what

1336
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,119
you're trying to accomplish

1337
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,560
which makes it sound significantly less

1338
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,160
stern

1339
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,640
yeah i mean also i've i'm on the d for

1340
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,480
side and so i've come to appreciate the

1341
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,000
use of the terms because when something

1342
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,160
goes wrong and it's like oh the controls

1343
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,760
failed it's just like do we have a

1344
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,760
reactor breach or is it just like we

1345
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,119
have a little alarm going off or

1346
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,960
anything so safeguard kind of gives bit

1347
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,319
more variance in terms of what the

1348
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,160
actual response can be and everything

1349
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,760
instead just assuming the most worst

1350
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,359
possible thing is occurring which we

1351
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,119
often get an infosec but not in every

1352
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:51,200
case for those type of situations that

1353
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,919
is very true

1354
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,200
um i don't have any other questions

1355
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,440
coming to mind or anything else from

1356
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,440
chad um was there anything else you

1357
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,200
wanted to cover or bring up it over the

1358
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,800
last few minutes we had

1359
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,040

1360
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,160

1365
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,800

i'm like i am not in my best form today

1372
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,359
um but that's okay because not every day

1373
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,240
is perfect and that's fine

1374
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,160
you know i'll say just looking at chat

1375
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,680
james comment of just calling things

1376
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,079
bubble wrap as a way protecting it is

1377
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:46,000
you know fragile but you know still

1378
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,319
resilient at that point i kind of like

1379
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,920
that event

1380
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,800
bumper controls

1381
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,880
um but yeah i think we're good at this

1382
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,880
