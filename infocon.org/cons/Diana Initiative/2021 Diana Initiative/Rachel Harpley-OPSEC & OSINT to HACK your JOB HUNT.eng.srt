so

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,719
that's very important you can't secure

20
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,640
something if you don't know it exists so

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,719
well worth checking those out there's

without their support

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,880
uh if you're new to infosec um as i

31
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,680
suspect um many of you will be

32
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,720
uh

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,880
yeah it's always a good idea just to

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,799
take a look at sponsors and see what

35
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,960

what what what they're all about

37
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,600
uh because they can give you

38
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,399
a bit of an idea of what what goes on in

39

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,560
infosec from outside the industry um and

89
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,360
she's dealt with major changes uh from

90
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,519
from moving from from one industry to

91
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:52,480

99
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,599

100
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,519
just they'll pop out and i can see them

information here is really my opinion

123
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,199

125
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,880
hard this talk might be a little hard

126
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,479
but that's not my goal

127
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,560
we are often harder on ourselves than we

128
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,280
are on others so please please be gentle

129
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,520
with yourself and i also want to say

130
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,680
that if you get turned down for a job

131
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,759
please remember that it's more about the

132
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,400
company than it is about you and your

133
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,919
self-worth doesn't depend on your

134
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,000
productivity or your employment and

135
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,479
sometimes it's okay to just be to just

136
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,759
exist

137
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,479
so who am i i'm rachel harpley my

138
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,639
pronouns are they she i'm sharing my

139
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,120
experiences from a decade in recruiting

140
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,360
seven years in technical recruiting and

141
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,600
five of those years have been focused on

142
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,639
infosec i.t security and cyber security

143
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,280
i will forever be captivated by patterns

144
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,240
symbolisms plant ocean life healing

145
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,800
physics and neurodiversity i live on

146
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,039
occupied land in the southwest and i'm

147
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,360
also autistic

148
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,280
when i was young i was the exceptional

149
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,919
child now as an adult my doctor calls me

150
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,479
a highly sensitive person which for the

151
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,800
record i don't recommend calling someone

152
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,039
even though yes many of my sensory

153
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,720
functions are different than what's

154
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,880
considered normal in high school one of

155
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,560
my friends tried me calling me a

156
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,800
chameleon i didn't even realize what i

157
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,440
was doing a few decades later i know

158
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,479
that i was masking masking is the term

159
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,160
where we either consciously or

160
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,400
unconsciously artificially perform

161
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,479
social behavior that is deemed more

162
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,039
socially acceptable for example i slip

163
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,120
into accents really easily when i hear

164
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,520
them and over the years i've contorted

165
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,840
myself in many ways but i think this is

166
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,160
a significant contributor to me becoming

167
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,080
a recruiter when i was young i was

168
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,560
unemployed for many months and i spent

169
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,720
many months trying to get a job and many

170
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,599
months failing i know how hard it is and

171
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,800
i want to make it easier for others

172
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,400
now i got flack for this on twitter

173
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,479
because you know it was a tweet thread

174
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,240
and not everybody was reading the full

175
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,960
thread but i said it stop applying

176
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,360
online it's a hot take in an industry

177
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,199
where most of the tenured people say

178
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,280
just apply that worked for me but that

179
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,759
worked years ago and really i'm a

180
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,840
recruiter i'm measured on the volume of

181
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,319
applications received so why would i say

182
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,880
such a thing

183
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,400
well that's because

184
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,319
about 80 of jobs are filled through

185
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,639
networking hang around infosec twitter

186
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,000
long enough and you'll see lots of

187
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,560
people hiring hiring for jobs that never

188
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,280
make it onto a job board and i'll be

189
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,039
honest i've tried to find attribution

190
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,960
for this figure it gets thrown along

191
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,560
around a lot

192
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,639
and there isn't really a good source for

193
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,560
it but it's one of those numbers where

194
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,759
everyone says yeah that makes sense

195
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,240
so you could say networking is kind of a

196
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,560
big deal

197
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,199
at the start of my career i was laid off

198
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,120
and unemployed for three months my mom

199
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,039
kept telling me that finding a job was a

200
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,080
full-time job i was you know at that

201
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,240
time the internet was at the library and

202
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,400
i was there five days a week multiple

203
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,160
hours a day i applied to hundreds of

204
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,080
jobs and i didn't get very many

205
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,000
interviews but i was consumed with

206
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,319
figuring out this process trying to hack

207
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,160
the code so i could mask effectively

208
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,479
enough to get a job i became obsessed

209
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,720
with figuring this out

210
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,960
and that was my first introduction into

211
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,800
just how broken recruiting is as a

212
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,200
business process applying online can

213
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,039
take upwards of 15 minutes per

214
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,519
application with a low success rate this

215
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,919
talk is about the roi of your time

216
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,599
invest it in building your professional

217
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,360
network your way

218
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,360
that said if you're actively seeking a

219
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,920
job being unemployed do allocate some of

220
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,000
your time to applying online it's kind

221
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,680
of like diversifying your financial

222
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,680
portfolio you know you never want to put

223
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,920
all of your baskets in one place but

224
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,160
when it comes to that roi networking has

225
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,480
a higher return

226
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,279
so

227
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,519
think of your job hunt as a hack

228
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,320
how do you bypass or really leverage

229
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,959
recruiters like me and remember it's

230
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,279
about making friends with your future

231
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,839
co-workers too

232
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,240
so for me this idea started with hacking

233
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,399
hired because in part i love

234
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,480
alliteration but mainly because it's a

235
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,800
system to explain and make something

236
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,760
manageable that has complexities

237
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,440
this process isn't known for its

238
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,760
transparency and probably when you're

239
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,519
about to hack a box that box doesn't

240
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,519
seem very transparent either

241
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,360
getting hired is like getting inside

242
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,920
hacking the box and in another talk i go

243
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,760
into more depth into these four primary

244
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,000
attack factors but i think it helps to

245
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
give them some context here

246
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,839
people vectors include different types

247
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,440
of recruiters and different types of

248
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,800
hiring managers

249
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,720
organizations as a vector because

250
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,320
different sizes of companies in

251
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,720
different industries operate differently

252
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,120
and the tech factor includes job boards

253
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,120
applicant tracking systems that type of

254
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,680
thing and tools like your resume and

255
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,560
social presence make the tools vector

256
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,640
for this talk we're going to talk about

257
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,360
ocent for people and orgs and opsec for

258
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,079
tools and tech

259
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,000
this talk will focus on these two

260
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,079
processes in order to help make a

261
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,680
daunting search into something more

262
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,640
manageable as a refresher upsec is a

263
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,959
process that identifies info and how

264
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,720
that info might be interpreted or

265
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,959
leveraged by others and then take steps

266
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,640
to eliminate or reduce exploitation

267
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,560
in this context i'm considering each of

268
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,519
us as our own autonomous entity the

269
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,279
opsec process gives us a framework to

270
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,399
examine the entity and in this case

271
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,600
ourselves

272
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,519
who do i think i am

273
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,760
how do others perceive me how do i want

274
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,480
to be perceived what actions can i take

275
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,560
to that goal

276
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,959
and really it's a five step process

277
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,880
it starts with identifying the critical

278
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,760
info analyzing the threat analyzing the

279
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,079
vulnerability analyzing the risk and

280
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,880
applying counter measures

281
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,320
so the first step

282
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,880
identifying that critical info is the

283
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,560
information which other people will take

284
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,519
to use

285
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,839
in order to take action against you or

286
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,959
for you

287
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,360
so take stock of your skills and gaps

288
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,120
know your own strengths

289
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,519
focus on your strengths your strengths

290
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,000
are your marketability ask those around

291
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,480
you if you need to but focus on the good

292
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,920
share your strengths

293
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,000
they are what will you will leverage in

294
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,200
order to get that job

295
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,959
and i uh i want to reiterate too that

296
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,200
you're when you're looking at yourself

297
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,399
you also want to look at your social

298
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,959
presence and actually jake williams

299
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,120
posted about this quite recently and i

300
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,279
asked him if i could include this in my

301
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,600
talk but this was a tweet thread where

302
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,920
he was uh going into some detail about

303
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,320
what this means so this recent tweet is

304
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,240
from the cto of breach quests and

305
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,480
rendition infosec during an interview

306
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,480
with a job seeker the job seeker used

307
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,959
the punisher logo as their avatar in

308
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:01,839
zoom

309
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,200
jake points out that any logo or or any

310
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,200
background with skulls or violence is

311
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,680
off-putting and as cto he has to

312
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,079
consider his customer in every decision

313
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,839
not just the customer but your future

314
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,519
teammates

315
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,040
excuse me jake points out that these

316
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,639
types of things will limit your career

317
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,000
opportunities

318
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,399
and so as much as you might be thinking

319
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,160
i want to work for a cool team and a

320
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,639
cool team will accept me that team also

321
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,079
has to think about their customer

322
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,920
so the other thing is that the

323
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,480
recruiters are probably looking up too

324
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,399
years ago before i got into infosec

325
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,000
recruiting i was in corporate talent

326
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,240
acquisition and one afternoon the hr

327
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,720
director pulled us into a boardroom for

328
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,240
an emergency talk

329
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,760
one of my teammates had extended an

330
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,160
offer to an inside salesperson that had

331
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,920
been featured on the local news for

332
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,399
scamming about seven grand from a sweet

333
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,200
old lady when we googled him there it

334
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,880
was the first thing that came up

335
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,120
multiple videos multiple segments from

336
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,760
the local news our clients also look up

337
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,680
our sales people so this was a

338
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,480
non-starter so do know that your

339
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,600
recruiters are looking up to you

340
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,240
we call them gatekeepers or we call them

341
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,560
headhunters you'll be well served to

342
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,639
learn the difference so when considering

343
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,240
the people who can take action against

344
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,000
you there are more than one type of

345
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,320
recruiter there's a talent acquisition

346
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,240
or corporate recruiters they are

347
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,920
screening hard for culture fit and

348
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,240
long-term commitment and they're often

349
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,800
bound by the minimum requirements in a

350
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,160
job posting

351
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,800
they get audited for the types of

352
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,800
candidates and the interview process

353
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,199
that is performed and then there's

354
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,079
agency recruiters who like the internal

355
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,160
recruiters are working for the hiring

356
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,639
manager but they may have freedom to act

357
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,880
in your best interests as well they may

358
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,519
consider you a client as well too

359
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,880
the thing to know about agency

360
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,560
recruiters though is that they really

361
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,399
are recruiting for entry level or junior

362
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,720
talent but they are a wealth of

363
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,800
knowledge about the industry and

364
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,160
customers that are out there

365
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,240
so the other side of this is that

366
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,160
there's also a difference between hiring

367
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,399
managers and how hiring managers screen

368
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,320
an interview depending on whether they

369
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,720
are technical or not either way they are

370
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,839
the ones and hiring and that's where you

371
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,160
want to focus your efforts it's also

372
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,680
important to consider the types of

373
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,800
organizations so a technical manager and

374
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,199
non-technical manager may view

375
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,360
certifications differently and they may

376
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,360
go about the interview process in

377
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,040
different ways as well

378
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,199
and then with types of organizations

379
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,880
there's a big difference between a large

380
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,199
enterprise and a small to medium-sized

381
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,600
business or startup large enterprises

382
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,920
are very risk adverse and they have

383
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,639
extensive processes and

384
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,800
rules in place with a lot of compliance

385
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,720
they need to follow whereas small to

386
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,560
medium-sized businesses and startups are

387
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,480
considered more agile so there's a

388
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,560
little bit more flexibility however a

389
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,959
large enterprise may have the budget and

390
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,519
staff in order to hire more entry-level

391
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,519
people but a small to medium-sized

392
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,680
business might choose more entry level

393
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,360
this is all about doing the research

394
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,240
which we'll talk about later

395
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,880
so using myself as an example

396
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,160
which are yeah

397
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,440
i have changed my career five times and

398
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,320
i'm

399
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,800
i'm not that old but it is a very common

400
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,040
thing to choose change your career most

401
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,040
recently it was from sales to recruiting

402
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,560
and it wasn't easy

403
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,720
even though i had recruiting experience

404
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,440
i kept getting calls for sales roles it

405
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,000
was frustrating so i worked with a coach

406
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,680
who pointed out that my linkedin and my

407
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,160
resume needed to be cohesive i was

408
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,399
including both the inside sales and the

409
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,399
recruiting on my resume i was thinking

410
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,519
about it in a very traditional way of

411
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,440
all of my experience

412
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,519
but which was i was i sales or

413
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,759
recruiting was i a flight risk as a

414
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,600
recruiting hire say i got a recruiting

415
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,720
job and then i was reached out to about

416
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,279
a fancy sales job would i fail

417
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,680
my resume raised too many questions and

418
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,600
to recruiters and hiring managers

419
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,160
questions often look like concerns

420
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,000
make sure you're conveying yourself with

421
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,480
clarity

422
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,880
in another example i have spoken with

423
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,480
countless people looking to move into

424
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,800
leadership the accomplishments of an

425
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,120
operator or a contributor are often

426
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,440
different than those of a manager you

427
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,959
need to be able to convey your

428
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,600
leadership accomplishments and also

429
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,680
leaders talk about project size and

430
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,480
budget sizes of team and infrastructure

431
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,199
scale matters here there's also a common

432
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,199
expectation of executive style and

433
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,959
presence on social media and in your

434
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,759
resume many people choose to work with a

435
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,360
coach for this very reason

436
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,720
now moving to analysis of vulners

437
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,199
this isn't about beating yourself up

438
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,720
and now we often think about

439
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,360
vulnerabilities as weaknesses weaknesses

440
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,839
can be areas of opportunity as well the

441
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,639
goal here is to prepare yourself and to

442
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,920
know yourself

443
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,600
like for example do you need structure

444
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,920
or flexibility would you be better

445
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,199
enjoying an enterprise or a startup and

446
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,959
what you need in a workplace or a

447
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,160
manager

448
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,679
these are all important questions to

449
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,839
consider

450
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,919
and when taking a risk assessment we're

451
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,000
looking at probability and impact

452
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,280
examined

453
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,359
cross-examined by levels of threat and

454
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,119
vulnerability this is where the

455
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,359
culmination of your work and the doc and

456
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,919
your documentation of your process is

457
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,080
important this is where it all comes

458
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,440
together

459
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,679
only you can make these determinations

460
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,080
but it's okay to ask for feedback while

461
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,240
only you know the details of your

462
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,039
situation this often works best when you

463
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,480
work with someone else like a mentor

464
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,679
coach or buddy it's easier to get the

465
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,000
full picture when we have another set of

466
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,280
eyes so for example uh maybe you're

467
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,360
casting yourself or spreading yourself

468
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,400
too thin by casting a wide net um

469
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,840
so often in security

470
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,840
we say that we can you know studied

471
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,000
across six different disciplines well

472
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,880
which discipline is your uh passion you

473
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,559
know where do you want to focus

474
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,720
sometimes it can be beneficial to focus

475
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,000
on one discipline in order to really

476
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,240
convey that cohesive picture

477
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,400
and then are you tracking your activity

478
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,919
to ensure that what you're doing is

479
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,840
being effective you know if you always

480
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,520
go to this one meetup but you've never

481
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,799
made a good connection out of that

482
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,480
meetup maybe don't go to that meetup

483
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,080
anymore and find another use for your

484
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,919
time

485
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,440
next you can apply measures or

486
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,160
specifically action control for example

487
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,320
i removed my sales roles from my resume

488
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,640
and my linkedin profile and i continue

489
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,160
to to

490
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,000
look for ways to communicate myself with

491
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,320
clarity i researched my industry

492
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,160
recruiting and how to advance what

493
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,640
career paths look like and i worked hard

494
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,000
to make sure i was

495
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,160
succeeding in every role i had and then

496
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,240
i also took a certification course so i

497
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,640
could learn the goal of that course for

498
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,160
me was about learning the skills i

499
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,240
needed for my job not just about three

500
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,640
letters at the end of my name

501
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,320
so

502
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,400
that's kind of a lot in the first half

503
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,480
huh optic for job hunting is about

504
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,919
knowing yourself and knowing the players

505
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,160

506
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,919
prize you want now let's all take a

507
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,840
breath and i'm gonna check in and see if

508
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,799

510
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,860

yeah that uh stacy is like your graphics

515
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,679
uh they like the fact that that

516
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,039
um

517
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,559
uh you you quoted um

518
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,720
from from the internet which which was

519
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,480
good um

520
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,679
but

521
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,440
uh yeah i don't see any uh any questions

522
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,200
just yet um so we've got some some

523
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,080
good good good comments so but yeah so

524
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,640
we can take this moment to have a breath

525
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,360
in and out and then we can continue um

526
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,760
yeah just a reminder if there are any

527
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,200
questions please just dump them in the

528
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,840
chat and i'll ask away

529
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,360
all right thank you alan and thanks

530
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,880
everyone i really appreciate the kind

531
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,760
words um i it's a it can be a lot to do

532
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,320
self reflection so i wanted to make sure

533
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,720
we take that moment to pause but diving

534
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,880
back in and taking another look at these

535
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,039
vectors as a reminder you know these are

536
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,880
really just all components to the

537
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,960
process that you can

538
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,600
take a look at and analyze

539
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,400
so

540
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,919
the reality is

541
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,240
i mean i struggle with networking it's

542
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,080
not that i'm an extrovert i just play

543
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,440
one on tv

544
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,600
many of us struggle with networking and

545
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,200
this is another one of those figures on

546
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,480
the internet that doesn't really have

547
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,520
any attribution but they say 38 of

548
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,200
people find it difficult to maintain

549
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,080
their business relationships and uh you

550
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,679
know i'm pretty sure it's a lot higher

551
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,080
than that with opsec and ocean you can

552
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,840
inform your networking and make it your

553
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,480
advantage so what is ocean well ocean is

554
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,240
open source intelligence that is a

555
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,880
process of collecting analyzing and

556
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,640
making decisions about

557
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,640
about data that is accessible in

558
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,360
publicly available sources so

559
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,440
it's a process of collecting is another

560
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,440
way of saying that uh you know

561
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,280
documentation documentation

562
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,240
documentation

563
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,400
and it's about doing your research we

564
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,240
talked about how important networking is

565
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,400
and it's definitely a challenge

566
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,480
this research can help make your

567
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,400
networking intentional and purposeful

568
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,039
number one here again don't break any

569
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,919
laws don't violate anyone's privacy with

570
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,320
great power comes great responsibility

571
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,480
consider your end goal we are humans

572
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,799
having a human experience keep that in

573
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:49,760
focus

574
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,600
build relationships that are memorable

575
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,080
in a positive way and don't violate

576
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,000
anyone's privacy

577
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,240
it's a journey and not a destination

578
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,159
networking is both the long game and

579
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,600
immediate games

580
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,240
listen more and ask more questions write

581
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,559
down their answers you might think it's

582
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,480
memorable but you'll be surprised how

583
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,960
much data gets lost as you push through

584
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,400
on this search

585
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,240
and always add value like with

586
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,200
positivity gratitude and kindness givers

587
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,200
truly gain

588
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,880
so make a plan

589
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,159
work your plan

590
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,559
what big companies are in your area do

591
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,159
those companies have established

592
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,559
security teams what kind of roles do

593
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,960
they hire for do they ever hire for

594
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,679
entry level or junior or even the thing

595
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,320
that you're passionate about like maybe

596
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,360
disaster recovery or forensics

597
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,600
who leads those teams do they have

598
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,760
social media are they speaking at an

599
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,960
event soon

600
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,799
those kinds of things could be your in

601
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,440
for starting a conversation and again

602
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,840
research document research

603
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,120
document and this meme this is really

604
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,039
why it matters i talked about that

605
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,200
advice that goes around so often of just

606
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,280
apply i hear it all the time and i

607
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,960
understand that a lot of it is based on

608
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,280
the fact that women tend to undervalue

609
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,640
themselves i think that every woman is

610
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,600
uh deserved every job but the fact is we

611
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,280
are fighting against this tidal wave and

612
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,919
so if you have the spare time

613
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,159
you know go ahead and apply online if

614
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,240
you have a full-time job search

615
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,720
definitely apply online finding a job is

616
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,880
a full-time job but again this is about

617
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,400
the value of your time and the

618
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,320
effectiveness of actions

619
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,000
and really i think it's just a giant pep

620
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,840
talk to encourage us all to make more

621
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,200
friends so hopefully by now you're

622
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,280
excited to get out there and network and

623
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,080
we're all on our way right

624
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,400
so on job hunting tools i've mentioned

625
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,200
documentation a few times by documenting

626
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,279
today you're contributing to your future

627
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,640
success uh i like to say you know a

628
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,360
future rachel is happy because of

629
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,679
something that today rachel did right

630
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,360
and so there's you know common

631
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,000
traditional ways like excel or sheets or

632
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,760
asana or trello

633
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,880
it was recently recommended the website

634
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,919
hunter

635
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,480
without any hunter is essentially like

636
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,720
an asana a trello but it's already built

637
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,720
out for job searching and they have a

638
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,480
free name level so if you don't know

639
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,799
where to get started that's a great tool

640
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,880
from a research standpoint linkedin

641
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,760
twitter meetup eventbrite even youtube

642
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,320
those are all your assets and then all

643
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,120
the job boards are an asset as well

644
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,880
it's really just important to track your

645
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,799
work and your roi keep track of who

646
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,799
you're reaching out to and and what ways

647
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,400
you can build a report uh build a

648
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,480
rapport with those people and that also

649
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,440
enables you to do something like an aar

650
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,000
which is an after action report so say

651
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,400
you go to a networking event or you

652
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,799
know attending diana initiative

653
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,559
you keep track of who you talk to and

654
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,480
what talks you went to and

655
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,760
some of the things you learned and that

656
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,039
lets you

657
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,320
keep track of who you want to keep

658
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,679
reaching out to and building those

659
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,640
relationships with

660
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,240
and as you dig into your markets

661
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,480
research look for the helpers and mr

662
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,279
rogers always says who's offering

663
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,760
twitter linkedin youtube even facebook

664
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,559
and i'll say it even the clock app are

665
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,320
blessed with infosec creators giving

666
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,559
their time and knowledge these creators

667
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,240
may not be hiring themselves but they

668
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,120
may share influent jobs it seems like

669
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,559
you might be goofing off being on

670
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,120
twitter all day but it also could get

671
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,960
you the advantage to be one of the first

672
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,520
applicants in a brand new opening

673
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,600
over time you will identify technical

674
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,840
managers and your network will grow

675
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,400
follow hashtags create google alerts

676
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,480
look for the helpers they want to see

677
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,000
you get in this career as well

678
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,480
so make a process work a process up

679
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,200
second ocean are a process so you can

680
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,880
work this process

681
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,200
one of the ways that you could do that

682
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,600
is by defining and refining your ideal

683
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,640
job profile so by knowing who you are

684
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,000
you can know what kind of job you're

685
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
looking for and you can define and

686
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,559
refine your ideal team profile

687
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,760
do the research to find out who and

688
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,520
which companies align for that and then

689
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,039
what hiring managers are at those

690
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,520
companies personally reach out to them

691
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,279
personally reach out to the helpers and

692
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,840
aim for manageable daily goals track

693
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,960
that work so you can get your roi

694
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,200
and i'm sure many of us have heard about

695
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,960
smart goals before

696
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,799
but i think it's a great format you know

697
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,720
you're talking about specific

698
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,159
measurable attainable time relevant

699
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,400
and uh relevant and time based right

700
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,640
smart and you'll need to personalize

701
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,320
these for your your goals and your

702
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,600
situation

703
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,919
so for example if you're actually

704
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,159
actively looking you are probably going

705
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,320
to spend more time every day five days

706
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,960
away five days a week and you might have

707
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,440
a goal of one new solid connection a day

708
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,440
you know something really reasonable

709
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,000
um and then you know maintaining and

710
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,320
following up on previous ones as you go

711
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,960
along if you're passively looking it's

712
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,279
good to still be active i've heard

713
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,679
cesars talk about being active like 15

714
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,400
minutes a day on linkedin and reaching

715
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,000
out to someone you previously worked

716
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,080
with or previously connected with in

717
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,640
order to maintain that connection

718
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,279
one of the things about linkedin as a

719
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,000
networking and job board site is that by

720
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,240
being active every day linkedin's

721
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,840
algorithms pay attention to your

722
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,840
activity and your profile will rank

723
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,919
higher in their searches when you are

724
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,240
active on their site on a regular basis

725
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,960
so for example me as a recruiter when i

726
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,559
go to search for candidates the

727
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,159
candidates that have been active on

728
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,720
linkedin more recently will show up

729
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,240
higher in my search results

730
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,679
and

731
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,399
let's see this goes to the connection

732
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,840
cycles when we're talking about

733
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,279
networking and interpersonal

734
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,600
relationships there's a connection cycle

735
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,440
and i know that this is something that

736
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,440
neurodiverse people like myself often

737
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,159
struggle with it's really easy for us to

738
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,080
feel very close to someone we haven't

739
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,919
talked to in years

740
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:00,640
but

741
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,440
not everyone thinks that way uh so you

742
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,120
know learning to be purposeful in

743
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,279
maintaining our relationships is really

744
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,480
key so this cycle of maintaining

745
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,520
relationships is uh is something that

746
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,360
can support

747
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,120
is once you have your research and

748
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,520
documentation you can make it actionable

749
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,159
with these kinds of methods

750
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,120
so this is one way suggested here you

751
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,440
start by breaking the ice reaching out

752
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,559
including some kind of give now

753
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,720
gives can sound really big but it could

754
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,480
be something as simple as a genuine

755
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,799
compliment or you know you've shared

756
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,360
their post and made some uh nice

757
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,679
comments on your your post when you

758
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,440
shared it right that helps them

759
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,760
especially their content creator right

760
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,159
so that's some kind of game give or warm

761
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,760
reception that you've done and then you

762
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,679
can follow up with an ask if you have

763
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,200
one you don't necessarily have to have

764
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,679
an ask on the first time you reach out

765
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,760
but if you do make sure that it is

766
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,799
specific actionable and small you never

767
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,279
want to start with a really big ask

768
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,039
this is similar to smart goals when

769
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,120
you're thinking about writing asks and

770
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,000
then be sure to reciprocate so

771
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
you know give another compliment be

772
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,200
gracious

773
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,360
uh or you know if they end up landing

774
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,399
you a job consider gifting them a a

775
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,039
digital coffee or a digital book and

776
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,440
then repeat right it's a connection

777
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,640
cycle

778
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,960
rinse lather and repeat keep in mind

779
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,120
though we are all humans here and we are

780
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,240
all navigating full lives so be sure to

781
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,720
minimize any expectations you have of

782
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,840
others

783
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,200
when you're looking to build your

784
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,360
network don't do so out of a place of

785
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,200
expectations

786
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,840
it's always good to consider that the

787
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,000
other person has that full life

788
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,080
and of course always do your best and be

789
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,399
kind

790
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,799
so like i said givers gain

791
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,720
if you can help another person along the

792
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,240
way you're building strength in your

793
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,240
network even if that person is another

794
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,880
junior person you never know uh you know

795
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,480
they might not be your hiring manager

796
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,919
today but they might end up being your

797
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,159
hiring manager tomorrow so always

798
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,640
remember to do your best for others as

799
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,559
well

800
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,880
and yes networking is a skill it can

801
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,159
feel awkward

802
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,000
and that when you keep practicing then

803
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,919
you too can be a frisbee dog i mean i

804
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,440
want to be a frisbee dog when i grow up

805
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,760
right but like any skill it can be

806
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,320
mastered

807
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,720
as we wrap up remember that opsec and

808
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,000
osen

809
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,080
are tools that you can leverage in the

810
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,640
four attack factors to hack your way to

811
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,559
hired

812
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,799
you can hack organizations you want to

813
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,200
consider the right kind of team for you

814
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,440
who hires them for what in your area or

815
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,760
even remotely and who even hires for

816
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,679
your ideal role

817
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,520
you can hack people like the different

818
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,120
types of recruiters the different types

819
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,600
of hiring managers and content creators

820
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,520
or are out there helping people like you

821
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,399
and me

822
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,840
get farther in our careers

823
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,919
so if you take one thought from this

824
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:01,600
talk i hope it's this

825
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,840
i should start

826
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,440
networking at this point i'm open to any

827
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,279
other questions if we have questions now

828
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,399
uh yes yes uh we we actually have a

829
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,880
couple of questions which is good uh

830
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,799
just just to to

831
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:23,600
uh

832
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,679
yeah the most difficult bit about doing

833
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,480
a virtual talk is that you you're

834
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,559
sitting there and you have no idea but i

835
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,159
i'm busy watching all the comments here

836
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,159
and i'm getting a lot of good feedback

837
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,039
um positive not just not just questions

838
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,760
but a lot of people saying wow the

839
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,399
especially the memes uh resonated with

840
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,480
them and and yeah

841
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,279
so

842
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,159
so well done for picking those out uh

843
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,640
but yes okay let's let's jump into it so

844
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,720
uh the first question i got was from

845
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,159
sudo uh and the question is thoughts on

846
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,440
using bots to manage the tedious parts

847
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,279
of a job hunt

848
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,480
um

849
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,880
maybe even wider than that are there

850
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,919
ways that you can automate uh the boring

851
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,080
bits of of job hunting

852
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,320
yeah so i'm um

853
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,240
i'm i probably have like a pretty high

854
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,880
level understanding of box and scripting

855
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,480
but i would imagine there's definitely

856
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,399
ways that you could go about it i know

857
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,159
some of the um

858
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,240
there's even some job boards that are

859
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,880
called job aggregators and they are

860
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,360
essentially bots that scrape jobs from

861
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,480
other websites um so there's definitely

862
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,440
ways that you can use it um i'm sure you

863
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,760
know twitter's a great example if you've

864
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,600
identified hiring managers you want to

865
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,440
keep an eye out right so maybe you can

866
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,960
have a bot that um triggers uh triggers

867
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,760
uh

868
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,480
retweeting uh a hiring manager once

869
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,919
every week or something like that like

870
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,760
or you know you maybe don't want to be

871
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,279
the person that

872
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,600
every single time right but having some

873
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,720
type of iterative process in there um i

874
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,200
imagine you know similar to

875
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,799
rss rss feeds um and google alerts

876
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,880
there's a type of form of scripting that

877
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,480
you could do to

878
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,440
keep track of updates so maybe a hiring

879
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,240
manager doesn't constantly post updates

880
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,760
on their linkedin

881
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,840
but when they do it's about a job right

882
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,360
and so you know you want to keep an eye

883
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,679
on uh on that hiring manager for when

884
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,919
they post updates that's a great

885
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,640
instance sometimes the recruiter posts

886
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,120
the job uh but it's the hiring manager

887
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,640
that's behind it so maybe you could put

888
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,679
bots on the recruiters and uh and see

889
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,840
that update and then you know to go and

890
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,840
check out that i'm sure there's a lot of

891
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,519
ways that you could use bots and it's

892
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,360
something i have a just a minor

893
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,120
familiarity with but i'm sure there's a

894
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,799
lot of creative ideas we could talk

895
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,640
about

896
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,240
great idea

897
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,200
yes yeah absolutely um i i have a

898
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,799
following question of that but i'll keep

899
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,279
my questions for the end uh so that the

900
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,480
next question came from uh stacy um this

901
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,640
the this question did come in i think

902
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,519
before with the slide we use we started

903
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,039
to deal with this but i'll read the

904
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,399
question um how do you even break the

905
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,359
ice in my head i always imagine the

906
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,599
people i want to reach out to have a

907
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,599
million messages and i'm just another

908
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:16,320
one

909
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,639
how do i stand out

910
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,879
that's a great point um

911
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,159
not every first message will uh will

912
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,280
maybe be responded to right so um keep

913
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,719
in mind that

914
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,399
you might not always get a response and

915
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,960
that's okay um so it's uh you know start

916
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,520
with that right so you know have a

917
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,560
tempered uh expectation out of it that

918
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,800
that will help um but you know the first

919
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,000
message you know hi i'm rachel

920
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,560
i saw your ex post about blah blah or i

921
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,960
you know really um interested in your

922
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,520
company and i thought i would introduce

923
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,920
myself because i'd like to get to know

924
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,320
more about what you look for in your

925
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,880
team right so you might not be hiring

926
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,920
today but um i'd love to hear a couple

927
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,320
of thoughts on what you do hire for when

928
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,920
you do hire and they may not respond um

929
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,000
but they might you might pique their

930
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,480
interests and it's it for me it comes

931
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,720
back to looking for the helpers so you

932
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,079
kind of have to

933
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,000
take your odds in reaching out and you

934
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,560
might not know if they are open to it

935
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,560
right away but if you're you're kind and

936
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,000
nice you're going to find those people

937
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,320
that are and i think one of the things

938
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,280
that

939
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,800
has really impressed me about this

940
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,440
industry is that most of the people in

941
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,920
this industry want to help people get

942
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,880
into the industry um they meet you know

943
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,320
they may not have the time right then

944
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,440
and there

945
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,920
but usually if they can help they want

946
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,800
to help uh so you know you you give it a

947
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,640
shot you try but i would say maybe you

948
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,280
know eight to nine ten eight to nine

949
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,320
times out of ten you'll probably hit a

950
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,480
successful and if you're looking to

951
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,880
build your confidence doing that i would

952
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,040
start with those content for creators

953
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,160
those helpers right um you know there's

954
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,240
folks that have they post on twitter but

955
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,359
they also run a twitch stream right so

956
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,680
going to a live event that they have

957
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,359
that helps break the ice because that's

958
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,160
a time that they have scheduled for that

959
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,040
kind of conversation and then sometimes

960
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,359
hiring managers show up to that uh you

961
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,520
know they go to other networking events

962
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,880
like this and it gives you a chance to

963
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,280
make that connection hopefully that uh

964
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,640
helps answer that for you stacy

965
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,079
okay i'm gonna skip over um

966
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,240
that daphne's got a good question but uh

967
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,119
um i just wanna uh go to jairus question

968
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,320
because it is related um and jared's

969
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,440
question is

970
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,280
do you have uh do you have any

971
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,040
suggestions on how to reach out

972
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,200
specifically on linkedin to to

973
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,720
individuals

974
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,160
yeah um so there's a couple of options

975
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,920
linkedin likes to uh sell in mails right

976
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,160
um if you pay for premium you get a

977
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,760
certain number of in mails a month

978
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,560
included in premium so that's an option

979
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,560
um i think if you're going to use an

980
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,680
in-mill

981
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,839
one of the principles i learned in sales

982
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,320
is that um it helps if you

983
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,440
uh

984
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,640
you know if you're gonna you have a

985
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,079
target right you have a hiring manager

986
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,000
you're looking at it helps if you do

987
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,119
more than one action so you found them

988
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,680
you found their profile they recently

989
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,079
posted about an update about their

990
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,280
company and uh so you've liked the

991
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,640
update you've commented on their post

992
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,040
you possibly send them a connection

993
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,200
request with a nice note

994
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,800
and you can consider sending them an

995
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,520
in-mail as well if you feel like they

996
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,000
might be more formal and it would be too

997
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,880
casual to request a connection you can

998
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,599
like their post comment on their post

999
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,680
and send them an in mail giving them

1000
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,280
more context of hey i'm rachel i you

1001
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,960
know it's really exciting to see that

1002
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,920
news about your company's growth and i'm

1003
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,000
looking to build my network so that i

1004
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,720
can

1005
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,560
further my career in information

1006
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,599
security i would love to hear your

1007
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,320
thoughts on getting into the field and

1008
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,760
learn more about whether or not you're

1009
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,599
hiring for your team

1010
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,320
please let me know if we'd be if you'd

1011
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,880
be open to connecting right so the big

1012
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,599
thing is uh multiple touch points right

1013
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,520
so you're giving them that compliment

1014
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,079
you're engaging with their public post

1015
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,119
but then also following up and starting

1016
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,400
a private conversation as well

1017
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,520
okay um now to to daphne's question um

1018
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,560
okay so but basically it would be advice

1019
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,480
on on titles uh so so the question is i

1020
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,839
pivoted now i pivoted and now have

1021
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:53,200
six years of cyber security experience

1022
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,760
uh there are relatively few titles in

1023
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,960
cyber security um so the cso architect

1024
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,040
engineer analyst

1025
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,880
and

1026
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,880
daphne's building tech experience but

1027
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,240
has no cybersec title that really

1028
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,440
captures

1029
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,640
uh

1030
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,680
the

1031
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,280
15 years of previous experience

1032
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,720
how can you optimize a title for someone

1033
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,000
like that

1034
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,720
yeah that's a great question um and

1035
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,920
actually

1036
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,320
i think it's one of the biggest reasons

1037
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,720
that recruiting can be such a challenge

1038
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,880
for recruiters because if you think

1039
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,359
about it you know recruiters we're used

1040
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,119
to like in the finance industry right

1041
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,680
there's accounts payable receivable

1042
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,960
there's a controller then there's the

1043
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,680
cfo right i mean simplifying it but

1044
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,000
there's a clear progression in in that

1045
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,920
industry whereas in security there

1046
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,440
there's a sort of you know you've

1047
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,079
identified what they're essentially is

1048
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,160
but historically you know they really

1049
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,560
weren't those titles for excuse me many

1050
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,240
people that were building their careers

1051
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,880
and in some organizations a security

1052
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,520
analyst is doing engineering work

1053
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,240
um whereas an engineer is doing analyst

1054
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,200
work

1055
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,760
excuse me so it can be a little muddled

1056
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,000
right and and so it's definitely a

1057
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,560
challenge i want to caveat my answer by

1058
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,520
saying i don't encourage anyone to lie

1059
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,760
um you know you you want to be truthful

1060
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,319
in your resumes um but there is some

1061
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,240
finessing that you can do when it comes

1062
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,640
to job titles uh you know as long as

1063
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,680
that job title is a truthful reflection

1064
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,240
of the work that you contributed and

1065
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,560
what you've done there a resume is an

1066
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,800
advertisement it's not a legal job

1067
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,359
application where um you know you know

1068
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,839
legal job application is can be verified

1069
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,359
against employment verification that

1070
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,440
kind of thing your resume is your sales

1071
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,359
point right so there is some finessing

1072
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,599
you can do there um i would look at the

1073
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,240
components of what you contributed and

1074
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,520
how the components of what you

1075
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,839
contributed your accomplishments there

1076
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,760
and how those align to those titles of

1077
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,599
like analysts architect that kind of

1078
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,079
thing the other side of that is i would

1079
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,839
look at the job to which you're applying

1080
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:04,880
to

1081
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,960
because quite frankly a recruiter is

1082
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,880
doing this

1083
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,280
in their head and saying okay i need

1084
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,720
10 years of experience and i need xyz

1085
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,760
technologies right so your resume wants

1086
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,560
to say i have 10 years of experience in

1087
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,800
these technologies you put that right in

1088
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,119
the summary on top um but then with the

1089
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,760
job titles uh you know there is

1090
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,640
some things you can do to pull out uh

1091
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,760
you know if you if you didn't feel

1092
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,440
comfortable changing your job titles the

1093
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,839
other thing you can do is add on to it

1094
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,560
so you could say security analyst dash

1095
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,319
you know the actual job title you were

1096
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,319
doing right so you can kind of add into

1097
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,160
that space there's some room there to do

1098
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,400
that hopefully that helps answer your

1099
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,960
question

1100
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,880
okay uh the next question comes from

1101
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,880
gina and i i can actually answer this

1102
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,640
one so it says are you going to put this

1103
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,000
talk online

1104
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,160
uh we are recording it and my

1105
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,000
understanding is that it will be made

1106
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,720
available online at some stage so yeah

1107
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,960
hi gina

1108
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,839
thanks for being here

1109
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,680
um

1110
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,000
okay

1111
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,240
moving along so uh

1112
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,880
cj has a question um

1113
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,800
i heard it's a good idea to look up a

1114
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,520
person on linkedin and do some research

1115
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,920
on them before an interview

1116
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,079
what do you think is the best thing to

1117
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,079
learn about the interviewer and how

1118
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:31,760
would you suggest bringing it up in an

1119
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,720
interview without deterring from the

1120
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,720
interview's purpose

1121
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,119
yeah so

1122
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,200
some of the things that i have seen and

1123
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,960
pointed out

1124
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,160
a foreign study so if uh you know if

1125
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:46,880
they

1126
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,079
uh studied overseas uh that's you know

1127
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,240
something you can point out or if you

1128
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,160
have a similar alma mater or if you um

1129
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,040
you know

1130
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,720
once upon a time worked at the same

1131
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,839
company or in the same industry um

1132
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:04,079
when you're calling out something like

1133
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,640
that the end goal here is kind of like

1134
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,560
social engineering the end goal is to

1135
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,359
build that relationship right um so

1136
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:12,480
you're you're

1137
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,319
looking to build rapport

1138
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,359
or connection so um ideally you're

1139
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:19,119
looking for something that you can say

1140
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,880
oh that person's like me or i like that

1141
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,079
sport too

1142
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,440
or i studied that language as well um

1143
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,160
sometimes it's not gonna be there right

1144
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,880
um you know there's no guarantees on

1145
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,119
that um but you know maybe they went to

1146
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,920
a university that you really respect or

1147
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,200
that you like the sports team um

1148
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,440
you can you can find essentially the

1149
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,040
goal here is to find something you can

1150
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,400
compliment them on um you know i once uh

1151
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,800
had an interview with a recruiter and i

1152
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,760
you know found her twitter and she had

1153
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,319
recently started shopping with imperfect

1154
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:57,839
and i just started shopping with

1155
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,560
imperfect and so it was a a little note

1156
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,720
that uh you know she's posting it

1157
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,640
publicly um but it was you know i was

1158
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,240
like oh you know i wanted to make sure i

1159
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,560
knew how i was you know interview with i

1160
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,480
looked at your linkedin i looked at your

1161
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,480
twitter and you know how are you liking

1162
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,839
and perfect i just started with

1163
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:15,920
imperfect as well and she was so excited

1164
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,560
she loves and perfect it was his whole

1165
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,520
little moment of bonding on that so um

1166
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,000
