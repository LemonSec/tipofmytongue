00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,599
hello everybody

2
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,680
welcome to stage one i hope you are

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,439
having a great session today

4
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,720
of day two of diana initiative our next

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,840
speaker

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,400
is moonish walter puri who will be

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:26,880
speaking

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,800
to us today about conciliance and

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,560
culture the connectivity

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,440
between cyber defense now moonish is as

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,520
passionate about cyber defense as he is

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,800
about diversity

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,879
and he's an advocate and an ally who

14
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,600
cares deeply about building community

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,000
whether that's defending our cities or

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,399
diversifying our work spaces

17
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,120
culture change is at the core of both of

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,320
these ideas and

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,840
that is what this talk is going to

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,480
explore there'll be a great

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,879
question and answer session at the end

22
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,239
and his talk will be

23
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,239
recorded i'd like to take this moment

24
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,280
now to say

25
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,159

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,119
the career village there's a capture the

31
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,640
flag event if you want to poke your nose

32
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:16,880
in

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,240
iot village and without any further ado

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,320
i would like to hand this over to

35
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,439
moonish please enjoy his talk

36
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,439
thank you so much cheryl uh just making

37
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,880
sure you can hear me okay we're all good

38
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,960
great hello everyone

39
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,720
uh it is really nice to be here i

40
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,400
am really excited to present at diana

41
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,799
initiative mainly because i knew that

42
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:43,520
this would be

43
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,280
a space that was open

44
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,560
and safe for me to try out this idea

45
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,040
that i've been knocking around in my

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,560
head

47
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,159
so i the the prompt here for you is

48
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,799
not so much that i'm going to pass along

49
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,399
something but i really want to

50
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,920
talk with you about this i know that

51
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,280
might sound strange in this virtual

52
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,000
space but

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,600
i'm still trying to get my head around

54
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,080
this idea but i want to share with you

55
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,520
the research that i've done thus far in

56
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,800
the thinking that i've done thus far

57
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,520
so let me start with just what i'm going

58
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,560
to talk about

59
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,280
uh give you a bit of a preamble and the

60
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,239
premise

61
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,599
of this idea and then the what i see is

62
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,760
the congruence and the contrast between

63
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,480
the two

64
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,760
the framework to try and put them

65
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,840
together and then round off with some

66
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,120
ideas

67
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,720
hopefully you get the pun in the title

68
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,319
flintstones spark journey

69
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,920
i thought it was good all right so i

70
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,000
am both in cyber security practitioner

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,680
and a deni practitioner that

72
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,040
feels a little strange to say like

73
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,720
practitioner of but

74
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,480
i've been in both of those spaces for

75
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,640
quite some time for a lot of my career

76
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,599
before they were necessarily defined

77
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,159
communities around it

78
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,480
and more recently i started to

79
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,080
notice and hear some similar

80
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,159
challenges ideas terminology

81
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,599
and it was more than just

82
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,040
similarities there are some of the same

83
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,000
pain points and some of the same goals

84
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,840
so i really try to

85
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,040
study what that comparison is so that's

86
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,319
that's the kind of overview but let me

87
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,519
lay it out this way imagine this

88
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,959
conversation between

89
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,120
two of our adversaries let's call them

90
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,159
alex

91
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,000
and bia so alex

92
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,239
says posit the security establishment is

93
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,400
burden without data technology

94
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,560
he has offers a consequence they have a

95
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,959
standard approach to security

96
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,000
a result their defenses are predictable

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,959
and b says in conclusion we can exploit

98
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,400
the same flaw

99
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,760
until they patch so you might get the

100
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,799
sequence

101
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,959
reference from sneakers great film

102
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,000
that's about cyber security in mind now

103
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,599
i want you to imagine

104
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,599
a very similar conversation with

105
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,959
diversity in mind

106
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,920
same two characters

107
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,238
alex starts with posit the security

108
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,240
establishment is burdened with outdated

109
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,120
views

110
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,600
consequence they build homogenous teams

111
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,320
result

112
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,840
their thinking and actions are

113
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,919
predictable conclusion

114
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,560
we can exploit the same flaw until they

115
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,880
patch

116
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,560
so here's my grand premise

117
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,479
that in security we do

118
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,600
everything we can to outmatch

119
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,000
and outwit our adversaries we use

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,040
automation

121
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,840
innovation optimization to maximize our

122
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,160
defenses

123
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,160
and our adversaries don't let borders or

124
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,320
preconceptions

125
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,759
or disciplines discourage them

126
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,479
why should we

127
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,479
we throw everything at

128
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,120
this fight except this one thing

129
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,600
which is equalizing the playing field so

130
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,080
no no just on that one we're gonna

131
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,160
we're gonna let that we're not gonna

132
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,320
we're not gonna bring that one it's like

133
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,720
a decathlon

134
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,400
and for nine out of ten

135
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,720
we're giving it everything and on the

136
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,800
tenth we just forfeit

137
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,800
that's that's what i feel so

138
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,919
i wanted to explore the idea that

139
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,280
there were lessons in both

140
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,039
spaces for the other

141
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,160
for this talk for this audience and for

142
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,960
this moment

143
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,160
i wanted to look at where there was

144
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,880
overlap in the what lessons we could

145
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,560
draw from

146
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,680
security into deni and i want to try and

147
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,800
do it in a thoughtful way

148
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,800
so first i'll introduce the

149
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,240
playbook there's not one this is a

150
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,759
version of it it's going to be very

151
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,240
familiar to you this cycle you've seen

152
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,520
some version of it

153
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,199
and and i hope it's all these are

154
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,720
familiar i'm not going to spend any time

155
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,840
on this actually

156
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,080
assuming that you all know it what i

157
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,199
will point out

158
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,120
is there are a few things that are

159
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,440
particularly

160
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,080
important inflection points first can't

161
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,080
defend what you can't see

162
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,160
if you over index on your alerts that's

163
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,680
going to lead to

164
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,039
apathy you should expect to get hit

165
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,560
and learn from it and you're only going

166
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,160
to really learn how to communicate after

167
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,199
that moment

168
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,080
so some key takeaways there bonus points

169
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,960
awarded

170
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,680
if you understand history and context if

171
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,360
you're using models and frameworks to

172
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,440
counter power dynamics

173
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,160
if you are thinking like your adversary

174
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,000
another way to talk about that is

175
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,960
empathy

176
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,720
and you're producing data-driven

177
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,039
intelligence

178
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,479
so we have that playbook or you know a

179
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,880
version of that

180
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,000
here's now where i want to draw some

181
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,039
congruence and contrast

182
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,639
between information security

183
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,800
and teni so first

184
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,319
some of the core challenges are

185
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,360
if not identical really similar

186
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,840
so what i'd like you to do here is read

187
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,960
this

188
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,440
sentence where it says function the

189
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,120
first time you read it i want you to put

190
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,400
security

191
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,840
in there and the second time i want you

192
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,440
to put in diversity so

193
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,879
we'll do it with this one despite

194
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,039
blaring headlines organizations struggle

195
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,720
to sustain focus on

196
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,080
security i'll try it again

197
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,400
with diversity despite blaring headlines

198
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,319
organizations struggle to focus

199
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,280
on diversity and this isn't just a fun

200
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,280
exercise okay you can substitute them

201
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,120
but this is something that at least i

202
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,479
have heard

203
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,080
very actively in both of these

204
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,919
communities to the point where they're

205
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:14,319
almost

206
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,800
right but there are some core challenges

207
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,840
this next one

208
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,199
i'm going to let you do on your own so

209
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,919
the first time read it with

210
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,520
one and then the second time the other

211
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,319
this one gets to the idea that you can't

212
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,039
add it

213
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,080
after the fact just tack it on

214
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,200
to what you're doing in your

215
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,599
organization or business or government

216
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,279
and that you need resources to

217
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,160
make it last and those resources can be

218
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,920
defined different ways people process

219
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,200
technology platforms

220
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,959
however you want to talk about it here's

221
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,040
another one

222
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,080
ignoring the need for diversity leaves

223
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,440
the organization's reputation

224
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,720
dangerously exposed

225
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,360
ignoring the need for security leaves

226
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,640
the organization's reputation

227
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,160
dangerously exposed

228
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,000
i think you can see where i'm going here

229
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,519
but i'm going to give you two more

230
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,640
because i think these ones are

231
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,880
particularly important

232
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,320
and we're going to spend some time a

233
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,959
little later talking about this one

234
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,160
people outside security

235
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,800
diversity tend to oversimplify and use

236
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,000
the terminology

237
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,680
incorrectly in security

238
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,839
look i've already used security cyber

239
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,839
security information security cyber

240
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,920
defense

241
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,600
in some cases they're interchangeable in

242
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,080
other cases they are very much not

243
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,080
thems fighting words if you switch

244
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,080
information security and cyber security

245
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,000
in the wrong context and that's pretty

246
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,519
crucial there's context

247
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,200
there's history there's there's an

248
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,800
understanding of the evolution of those

249
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,680
words

250
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,959
sometimes we can say security and we'll

251
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,120
know what that means same thing with

252
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,800
diversity i'm using diversity as a

253
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,240
shorthand for diversity equity and

254
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,880
inclusion

255
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,399
belonging there's different meaning for

256
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:58,959
each of those

257
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,959
we'll explore it but still an important

258
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,480
one last one

259
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,760
really this is about us as security

260
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,120
advocates we think of ourselves as

261
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,000
outsiders

262
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,760
and in some cases we pride ourselves on

263
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,200
that

264
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,640
as diversity advocates we think of

265
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,200
ourselves as outsiders

266
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,279
those that are either part of and or

267
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,720
representing marginalized groups

268
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,680
and so you have these set this set of

269
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,880
shared challenges

270
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,399
there there's more but these are the

271
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,760
ones that i wanted to distill down for

272
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,120
you

273
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,200
now the cliches i don't mean this in a

274
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,120
dismissive or glib way it's just

275
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,480
things that have come up to the point

276
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,800
where when we hear them make out right

277
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,279
okay

278
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,959
what else yes we know that

279
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,160
but it was really intriguing for me that

280
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,680
these had become cliches in both the

281
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,920
spaces so first is

282
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,880
don't be reactive be proactive then the

283
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,079
biggest problem is people in their

284
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:52,640
ignorance

285
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,959
what we talk about infosec is humans are

286
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:55,920
the greatest weakness

287
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,399
humans are your weakest link burnout is

288
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,839
a real problem

289
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,399
it was in a dni conversation that i

290
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,600
first heard the phrase don't light

291
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,440
yourself on fire to keep someone else

292
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,880
warm

293
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,360
that landed that one definitely landed

294
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,600
and change must start at the top

295
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,200
true they're truisms but it's

296
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,120
it's almost when we hear them go all

297
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,519
right i know that

298
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,600
what about operationalizing what about

299
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,079
executing

300
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,560
so it said something to me that they had

301
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,479
calcified around these ideas

302
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,959
so what that comes down to is that

303
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,480
there's some shared challenges in

304
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,800
changing culture

305
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,000
uh and here's two

306
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,360
the first is we need other groups

307
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,440
again we can be security we can be

308
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,600
diversity but we need other groups to be

309
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,120
part of the solution

310
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,440
right is security only the role of those

311
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,399
in infosec no

312
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,040
absolutely not in fact please please

313
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,959
don't let it be we need

314
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,519
other groups to help us secure the

315
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,720
organization

316
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,639
is improving diversity only the

317
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,320
responsibility of underrepresented

318
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,000
groups no again

319
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,760
right if anything the reverse that

320
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,920
change meaningful change only happens

321
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,680
when the groups that aren't directly

322
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,200
affected by it

323
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,040
stand up for that change so you

324
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,320
absolutely need

325
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,760
those dominant groups of the privileged

326
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,079
groups to do it so that there's a really

327
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,680
core shared challenge there the second

328
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,880
is unfortunately in both of these areas

329
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,880
at least what i've observed sometimes we

330
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,440
get bogged down in the what and the how

331
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,560
and we lose sight of the why

332
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,680
so in both cases there's a really clear

333
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,839
understanding of what others need to do

334
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,240
speaking of others what others need to

335
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:44,959
do

336
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,320
but not always the focus on why

337
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,800
they should sustain that change i'm

338
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,000
gonna leave these two thoughts

339
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,440
here for a second because we're gonna

340
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,200
come back around to them

341
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,560
i hope so uh two things i wanna share

342
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,160
that i've gotten from both groups that

343
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,600
are just really important always have a

344
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,040
races you don't know what a racy

345
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,800
model is it stands for responsibility

346
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,639
accountability consulted

347
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,560
informed and there's different ways to

348
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,240
chart this out but basically for any

349
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,440
initiative you look at who those

350
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,959
different groups are

351
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,719
the second is starting with why

352
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,120
so that people can sustain that change

353
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,560
so there's an important

354
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,000
caveat a really important caveat that i

355
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,720
remind myself it's not something that i

356
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,000
think anyone needs to be

357
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,920
warned about per se but before i

358
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,079
i started to go down exploring this

359
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,600
extended parallel

360
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,079
metaphor i wanted to make sure

361
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,880
i highlighted what the differences were

362
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,079
and what the really important

363
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,839
distinctions

364
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,760
when probably the biggest one at least

365
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,839
in my mind is that dni work

366
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,160
is about painful histories

367
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,760
and legacies and issues of race

368
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,480
gender sexual identity and many others

369
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,639
are connected to long-standing injustice

370
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,120
so when we talk about doing this work

371
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,839
and i

372
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,720
am here talking to you about the how

373
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,399
this is a really important part of the

374
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,920
why

375
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,760
this is a really really crucial part of

376
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,040
the y

377
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,639
that it should never be discounted or

378
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,760
just kind of rolled in i know everyone

379
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,360
knows that but i

380
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,639
here i want to share with you some

381
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,040
reminders that i tell myself

382
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,519
when i'm moving from one space to the

383
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,240
other trying to bring ideas over

384
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,120
from one to the other so the first is

385
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,279
i'm not suddenly a dni expert because i

386
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,480
have experience in security and i

387
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,000
noticed this parallel

388
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,839
you know simply because i didn't i have

389
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:50,959
the playbooks it doesn't make me a

390
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,320
denied ninja

391
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,920
there's still a lot of work to be

392
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,720
brilliant at the basics

393
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,480
the second is related to what i was

394
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,639
talking about before because of that

395
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,199
discussions around identity are fraught

396
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,959
and fragile

397
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,000
it's it's arguable whether cyber

398
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,120
security

399
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,040
conversations in an organization can be

400
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,560
seen through the lens of politics but

401
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,639
the discourse around de ni

402
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,240
is very much shaped by it and the last

403
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,760
is you know i can

404
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,040
think about how i present

405
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,920
myself when it comes to cyber security

406
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,120
to people who aren't in cyber security

407
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,720
but with many aspects of dni an

408
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,079
individual can't control how they're

409
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:34,800
seen

410
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,720
i recognize everybody probably realizes

411
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,839
that but that's why i see these are

412
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,160
reminders when i try it

413
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,720
import or adopt something so let me

414
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,279
share

415
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,720
now this framework that i'm thinking

416
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,519
about

417
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,440
and again this is an invitation to you

418
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,560
to test this this is the first time i'm

419
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,600
sharing this idea uh publicly

420
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
i've talked to colleagues about it and

421
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,440
people said oh that's interesting

422
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,000
i hadn't thought about that before but i

423
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,360
need more than that

424
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,120
i need to know what works what actually

425
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,160
connects and i've been talking to

426
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,040
colleagues in

427
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,600
the deni space as well to say does this

428
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,199
resonate does this land but

429
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,720
let's let's start with something

430
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,880
important here so i'm not sure if you've

431
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,160
heard this phrase

432
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,160
culture each strategy for breakfast

433
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,720
so it's a pity phrase and

434
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,320
it is uh inaccurately

435
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,600
uh attributed to peter drucker

436
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,079
um i have a link that i'll put in here

437
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:34,880
to

438
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,839
it's from a site called quote

439
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,759
investigator and it's very important

440
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,040
that you know that it doesn't come from

441
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,079
peter drucker nothing against peter

442
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,680
drucker very smart person

443
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,560
but uh it's a management phrase that has

444
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,600
been attributed to

445
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,199
and falsely he actually never said it um

446
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,079
and looking at the origin of that it's

447
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,680
been around for decades

448
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,759
what's the idea behind it the idea is

449
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,120
that culture starts

450
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,839
from the top and and if we think about

451
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:00,880
culture

452
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,680
as what an organization does when no

453
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,839
one's watching

454
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:11,359
then if you try and introduce a strategy

455
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,640
your culture culture of your

456
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,319
organization is going to constrain that

457
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,000
strategy

458
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,919
if the organization's values and

459
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,839
practices don't support that change

460
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,119
it can't be disseminated or sustained

461
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,359
and i'll say it differently or go a step

462
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,720
further

463
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,799
change must be sustained through the

464
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,320
culture

465
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,400
cultural change drives technical and

466
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,919
operational change

467
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,880
so this raises the question what if you

468
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,320
want to change the culture

469
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,400
where do you start so let me continue

470
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:44,799
with this

471
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,120
if culture eats strategy for breakfast

472
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,400
then diversity that's the table

473
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,679
this credit goes to my

474
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,039
awesome friend and mentor trey

475
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,720
boynton who runs uh

476
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,320
is involved with uh inclusion and

477
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,640
uh a lot of other work at cisco but also

478
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,480
as a coach really fantastic

479
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,919
she said this at a conference it just

480
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,200
rolled off her tongue and i was like

481
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,720
who's that where did that come from

482
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,160
that's amazing

483
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,400
um we'll explore this a little bit as we

484
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,799
get further but i like this idea a lot

485
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,799
up here's the peter trucker there's that

486
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,720
i'm a bitly fan i know everyone doesn't

487
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,720
love it because it's a little spammy but

488
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,440
um it's easiest way for me to give you

489
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,559
links

490
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,400
so i tried to put everything in bitly

491
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,160
that i'm referencing here

492
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,840
um check out this link uh so let's

493
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,039
let's explore this some more i found a

494
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,480
really great quote

495
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,600
from a um this one christy lake who's

496
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,799
chief people officer at

497
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,320
twilio and she think talks about culture

498
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,120
as an operating system she says we refer

499
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,720
to our values and principles

500
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,400
as our operating system it's like your

501
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,760
phone's operating system it works

502
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,039
invisibly

503
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,880
and it needs to be updated to make sure

504
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,240
it stays current where the company isn't

505
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,720
going

506
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,480
well here's really interesting

507
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,000
connection right someone's seeing

508
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,640
culture through a technical lens or

509
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,600
through a technological lens rather

510
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,799
there at the bottom is a link to the

511
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,039
full article but this was

512
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,039
independent validation that it wasn't a

513
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,960
totally strange notion

514
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,600
to me to try and connect these two

515
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,200
so let's start with some terminology

516
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,000
there is no i am not purporting to have

517
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,080
the authoritative definition of some of

518
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,679
these terms but i think it's important

519
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:32,400
that we

520
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,840
at least shape them for the purposes of

521
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,080
our conversation here

522
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,679
so first is around diversity

523
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,960
diversity are is differences

524
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,080
among us based on which we experience

525
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,480
systemic advantages or encounter

526
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,160
systemic barriers

527
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,640
in access to opportunities and resources

528
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,400
that was a mouthful but that's kind of

529
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:56,799
the

530
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,080
world that it encompasses a lot equity

531
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,760
centers more around fairness and

532
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,200
ensuring that everyone has

533
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,120
the same access to opportunities and

534
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,640
resources

535
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,159
and finally inclusion is celebrating

536
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,760
centering and amplifying the

537
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,320
perspectives and voices and values and

538
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,000
needs of people that

539
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,200
experience those barriers and

540
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,600
mistreatment i mean diana initiative is

541
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,919
a perfect example of all of these put

542
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,039
together

543
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,559
and really inclusion creating that sense

544
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,400
of belonging the other way i think about

545
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,840
it is diversity is what we are

546
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,320
and inclusion is what we do and equity

547
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,799
is how we do it

548
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,520
so with those laid out i started to

549
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,039
think about i'm really going to

550
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,520
dive into these now identity privilege

551
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,480
and access

552
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,559
and the question that came up for me was

553
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,240
are these homonyms

554
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,960
or synonyms are they words that are

555
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,400
written the same

556
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,679
but they have different meanings in

557
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,320
different contexts or are they the same

558
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,639
word

559
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,960
and similar meanings

560
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,559
so i want to deep dive on each of these

561
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,600
starting with identity

562
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,600
and identity in the security world

563
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,960
has various concepts attached to it

564
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,240
that are important so identity is

565
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,559
establishing putting forth a claim of

566
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,760
who you are

567
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,799
and authentication authorization

568
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,480
questions around anonymity and

569
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,640
pseudonymity

570
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,360
linkability connecting different i i

571
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,159
identities and the identifiers

572
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,320
that formulate that identity i know

573
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,600
everyone's familiar with these so i'm

574
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,799
not trying to

575
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,200
explain what this is i really just want

576
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,400
to anchor okay

577
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,799
that's how we think about it and there's

578
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,000
an element of uniqueness

579
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,200
to it and that uniqueness is

580
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,480
foundational in

581
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,480
building trust so then i thought about

582
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,840
how i hear and i started to read and

583
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,240
really

584
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,440
research the different definitions

585
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,760
or rather frameworks for thinking about

586
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,600
identity in the diversity equity and

587
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,480
inclusion

588
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,600
space and this gets to some really core

589
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,039
issues around

590
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,559
sociology and and race and gender

591
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,679
so just some examples obviously gender

592
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,840
identity sexual identity

593
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,480
racial cultural as you think through

594
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,600
these

595
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,400
you know the identifiers that are there

596
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,080
or the groups that can be associated

597
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,679
with the national identity

598
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,000
the how easy it is to establish those

599
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,600
identities whether it can be established

600
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,640
visually or

601
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,760
with some documentation or virtually how

602
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,520
it can be established

603
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,080
um and and so the shared space between

604
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,039
these

605
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,679
comes up when around if you think about

606
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,520
like biometrics

607
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,120
is is something that overlaps between

608
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,919
the two of these and privacy issues

609
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,360
as a result but really this

610
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,240
identity in the dni space is about the

611
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,919
sense of self

612
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,640
and providing sameness and continuity

613
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,159
over time

614
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,240
and the condition of being oneself and

615
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,000
not another but

616
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,640
it also it ties you to demographics to a

617
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,240
group

618
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,080
that shares elements of that identity

619
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,480
and so it is both one to one and one to

620
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,080
many

621
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,480
in the way that in the technological

622
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,440
space

623
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,760
we think about authentication and

624
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,120
verification as

625
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,039
an identification is a different one to

626
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,840
one to many

627
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,400
so next is this idea of privilege and

628
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,919
in infosec we talk about

629
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,320
designating special access or abilities

630
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,200
above and beyond that of a standard user

631
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,200
in deni it's the writer exemption

632
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,880
from liability or duty granted as a

633
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,640
special benefit or advantage and i

634
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,279
i found both those definitions after

635
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,400
looking at a few

636
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,840
to find where there were similarities

637
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,240
and parallels

638
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,480
but i think what is most important here

639
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,679
is that

640
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,520
we're we're trying to analyze

641
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,279
who is accorded privilege and who is

642
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,520
who is exempted from doing something or

643
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,240
provided special access as a result

644
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,279
and there are rules put that in quotes

645
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:20,559
because

646
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,520
in security you can design those rules

647
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,159
but in social circumstances or in our

648
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,360
society

649
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,799
it's arguable that they are designed and

650
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,840
and in some cases formed so

651
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,919
there is a few resources i want to share

652
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,840
with you that i found helpful

653
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,320
i've seen them before but revisiting now

654
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,400
under the lens of

655
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,760
thinking about privilege from a

656
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,320
technological standpoint

657
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,600
so first is this um piece by peggy

658
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,159
mcintosh she wrote in 1989

659
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,640
and it's very important um i want to

660
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,440
make sure

661
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,240
because she she writes here that for

662
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,600
those of you who are going to cite my

663
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,559
work

664
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,039
it's not about blame shame guilt or

665
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,440
whether someone's a nice person

666
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,080
it's about observing and realizing

667
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,439
thinking systematically

668
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,080
and it's about unearned advantage she

669
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,559
uses that phrase unearned advantage

670
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,880
which can also be described as exemption

671
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,400
from discrimination and i thought about

672
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,840
that from a technological standpoint

673
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,480
when

674
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,840
when a user is accorded privileged

675
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,400
access

676
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,600
the other thing i just want to be very

677
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,039
clear she said please don't generalize

678
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,120
these are just about my experiences

679
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,679
but i use this not to generalize but as

680
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,200
a very specific auto

681
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,960
you know her autobiographical experience

682
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,520
around privilege very incisive

683
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,679
um i found this very helpful this is

684
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,200
called 50 potential privileges in the

685
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,960
workplace

686
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,480
i'm not talking about tea and i hear i

687
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,720
mean yes but also

688
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,279
thinking about how privilege is afforded

689
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,039
and accorded

690
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,400
and what occurred to me is that when we

691
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
talk about privilege

692
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,360
in technology we think privileged access

693
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,960
must be verified

694
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,279
and protected we have this principle of

695
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,480
least privilege

696
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,240
and in the deni space it's about

697
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,880
acknowledging and in some cases managing

698
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,919
checking

699
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,320
privilege so similar but a really

700
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,000
important nuance of a difference

701
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,600
one thing i want to bring up is around

702
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,120
bounded awareness there's a great

703
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,080
article

704
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,880
um called decisions without blinders and

705
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,080
it's this idea that

706
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,720
once we've been made aware of something

707
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,799
it might have been there before but once

708
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:33,120
we've

709
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,320
it's been brought to our awareness we

710
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,840
start to see it everywhere you know if

711
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,559
um

712
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,919
someone talks to you about a particular

713
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:42,559
brand

714
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,919
or a show or a color or car

715
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,559
you start to see it everywhere it's been

716
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,000
present but now it's just highlighted

717
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,799
for you so

718
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,320
the role of privilege and awareness

719
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,000
and the connectivity between those is i

720
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,760
think really important

721
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,000
i thought this was a very powerful quote

722
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,120
privilege is the other side of

723
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,720
oppression it's often easier to notice

724
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,360
oppression

725
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,200
than privilege it's definitely easier to

726
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,559
notice the oppression you personally

727
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,919
experience than the privileges you

728
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:08,720
experience

729
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,039
since being mistreated is like is likely

730
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,480
to leave a bigger impression on you than

731
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,919
being treated fairly

732
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:14,799
you think about this in the

733
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,720
technological space the user is going to

734
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,240
know when they can't get to a thing that

735
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,360
they need to get to

736
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,399
but not when they've been afforded other

737
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,720
permissions

738
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,720
so i'm going to move along here to talk

739
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,760
about access

740
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,960
and this is where it started to get a

741
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,320
little uncomfortable for me because when

742
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,120
i

743
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,039
thought about how we as security

744
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,559
professionals think about access

745
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,880
think about locking it down and we

746
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,240
combine it with identity

747
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,240
to provide access to groups based on

748
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,279
authentication

749
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,880
but sometimes just by association

750
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,799
and when we think about that from a

751
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,480
diverse equity inclusion space

752
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,600
that's problematic so what does an

753
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,880
infosec professional like to think of

754
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,399
when they hear the term privilege access

755
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,240
something like this

756
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,240
right user access um meaningful security

757
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,559
how do you how do you get to the assets

758
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:03,679
that you need to get to

759
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,000
but here's something that occurred to me

760
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,880
who you are controls what you get

761
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,720
who decide on who decides on which

762
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,960
identities get access

763
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,840
and in a security environment we talk

764
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,080
about it

765
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,880
without emotion but it's the same

766
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,399
language it's the same decisions that

767
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:23,120
we're making

768
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,320
and if you ask this in a different

769
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,399
context it's a very powerful leading

770
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:27,120
question

771
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,480
what happens when an unauthorized

772
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,760
identity accesses a privileged resource

773
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,320
they reject it they get it investigated

774
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,880
there's a flag of some kind

775
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,960
and here's a big one how should systems

776
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,279
be secured to insecure

777
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,799
to ensure secured remote access

778
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:45,679
now think about that in the

779
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,120
technological terms but also think about

780
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,120
that in the non-technological terms

781
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,080
accessing something where you don't have

782
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,000
immediate proximity to that system

783
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,279
so here's how i started to think about

784
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,480
it the security of systems

785
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,000
is tied to identity privilege and access

786
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,159
and here's the idea that i want to share

787
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,360
with you is that

788
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,520
power is the ability to decide who will

789
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,120
access resources

790
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,360
and the capacity to direct influence and

791
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,720
behavior of others

792
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,120
think about privilege escalation that's

793
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,960
a key threat

794
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,440
that we think about and

795
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,760
that goes on the other side with

796
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,520
unearned access to resources only

797
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,000
readily

798
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,039
available to some people as a result of

799
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:29,919
their advantage

800
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,320
social group membership escalation of

801
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,600
of what they're able to access

802
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,960
so that we can continue down this i

803
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,480
thought about this for vulnerability

804
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,159
on the one hand it's a flawed system on

805
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,679
the other it's the ability to expose

806
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,039
oneself

807
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,360
but let's revisit these terms now and

808
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,559
talk about

809
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,159
fairness and access

810
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,960
that one really came down to me equity

811
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,120
is something really important

812
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,080
that we struggle with that organizations

813
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,679
struggle with how do you provide that

814
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,039
that equity because diversity

815
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,120
without inclusion or equity is not

816
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,760
sustainable

817
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,039
so here i want to carefully

818
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,679
extrapolate some things and i'll round

819
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,159
out soon

820
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,840
some ideas around

821
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:29,440
how we can adopt and

822
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,880
create a shared approach that's where

823
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,279
the word conciliate comes from it's

824
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,000
putting together

825
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,679
these two frameworks in

826
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,360
in a way that can help us in the

827
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,320
diversifying our organizations and in

828
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,840
maintaining equity and

829
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,120
inclusion so

830
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,960
nothing here is going to be really

831
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,399
revolutionary it's more about

832
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,159
simplifying it and creating something

833
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,360
that

834
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,120
and i'm trying to do this take this to

835
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,320
the deni communities in space

836
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,120
and and have it resonate and i'll talk

837
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,000
about what the why

838
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,559
is uh in a moment there

839
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,679
so the first is around awareness if you

840
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,440
recall i was talking about privilege and

841
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,279
bounded awareness

842
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,480
so we've heard this it's everybody's job

843
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,559
it's everybody at the organization to be

844
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,519
aware of security or diversity but if we

845
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,679
bring those back to what they're core

846
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,960
about

847
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,240
identity access privilege and really

848
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,919
being clear about what those terms

849
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,200
are that's something that is shared

850
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,480
between here so that's a really key

851
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,440
component

852
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,320
then we have assets and i really

853
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,840
encourage you to

854
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,519
not anchor on all your training that's

855
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,399
told you what assets exactly are

856
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,080
but to think about it a little

857
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,760
differently think about

858
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,760
the assets as the talent that the people

859
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,919
and the talents that they possess and

860
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,679
psychological safety

861
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,120
those are the things that really need to

862
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,799
be protected at an organization

863
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,240
so now i'm i'm trying to think about

864
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,760
how do you change a culture to improve

865
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,399
and allow for security and improve

866
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:19,440
diversity

867
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,559
both of those and

868
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,360
we know the people challenge and

869
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,559
information security i don't need to

870
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,000
talk about that

871
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,200
and so here we're attracting

872
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,440
retaining and representing that talent

873
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,880
is also about creating psychological

874
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,840
safety so to me

875
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,679
those are the really crucial assets to

876
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,200
protect

877
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,720
then we have this notion of access

878
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,480
and access control and privilege

879
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,640
escalation i'm still really tussling

880
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,960
with this idea

881
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,519
that when it comes to technological

882
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,279
resources there is a group that has

883
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,600
afforded the power to control

884
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,240
that access what about other resources

885
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,720
how are those how is that access

886
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,320
controlled

887
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,519
and within an organization how do you

888
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,320
ensure

889
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,840
that there is governance responsibility

890
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,640
and oversight for those other resources

891
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:16,960
so

892
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,000
there is equity and fairness

893
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,519
and similarly privilege escalation we

894
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,200
think and worry a lot about a user

895
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,640
being able to gain additional privileges

896
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,440
which gives them

897
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,640
access to sensitive or

898
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,799
prized resources

899
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,960
but how that's done in the teni space

900
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,000
it's not not as

901
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,080
easy as just saying what are your

902
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,519
identities and what is the privilege

903
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:46,480
that's afforded

904
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,840
as a result of it just that conversation

905
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,200
itself is really difficult and

906
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,360
challenging so i'm not

907
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,080
putting forth that we simply identify

908
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,679
and then that's it

909
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,480
but to bring this frame that with

910
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,200
privileged

911
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,960
access just privilege access in and of

912
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,960
itself is important

913
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,079
and there's not judgment around that

914
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,280
i'm i'm not saying you have this

915
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,159
privilege

916
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,639
ergo you're better in fact the other way

917
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,520
around

918
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,599
you have this privilege let's recognize

919
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,599
that let's recognize what's coming as a

920
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:22,800
result of it

921
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,320
and what's your responsibility with that

922
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,200
privileged access

923
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,040
you know in security we talk about

924
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,560
privilege access reviews privilege

925
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,199
access

926
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,960
account reviews last

927
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,040
is allies and adversaries and i put

928
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,079
these two together

929
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,839
because it's not just about

930
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:45,520
people and who is an ally and who is an

931
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,800
adversary

932
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,000
i think that's a false dichotomy in fact

933
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,440
i think it's more about understanding

934
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:53,918
that

935
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,079
adversaries for our organizations want

936
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,960
to exploit the scenes that we create

937
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,280
in our organizations in the silos

938
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,599
and that can be in different elements of

939
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:06,800
security

940
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,359
it can be you know physical security and

941
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:10,160
tech security

942
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,680
it can be different groups

943
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,440
that are trying to achieve the same end

944
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,920
but drawing on the same resources

945
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,079
or competing for the same mindshare to

946
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,200
try and change the culture of the

947
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,440
organization

948
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,720
this idea of allies

949
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,119
back to the decathlon i'm just mixing

950
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,320
metaphors like

951
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,560
like a bunch of salad see happen again

952
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:42,240
is if you are

953
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,480
at the decathlon you're at the olympics

954
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,839
you bring your best

955
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:50,720
team you bring the best folks possible

956
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,800
why would you work so hard to get there

957
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,320
and then go now we're gonna bench them

958
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,680
we're not even gonna look for the best

959
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,440
team

960
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,960
or we had the best team we're not gonna

961
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,160
work on keeping them we won the

962
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,440
championship last year we're not gonna

963
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,000
work on keeping them

964
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,079
why wouldn't you and and that comes back

965
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,119
to the assets

966
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,400
idea is that it's

967
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,760
it's about people and the talents that

968
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,240
they bring and then feeling

969
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,359
like their talents belong

970
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,480
so i want to wrap up here and bring back

971
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,800
this idea of the playbook and let's look

972
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,520
at it again now

973
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,800
so this idea of raising awareness

974
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,800
looking at your assets not being able to

975
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,560
defend what you can't see

976
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,000
if you don't know the role of

977
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,680
privilege and

978
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:51,520
how that in its relationship to power

979
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,000
you can't defend the notion that

980
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,520
identity controls access to resources

981
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,320
alert fatigue leads to apathy there

982
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:04,720
aren't

983
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,880
alerts in deni per se

984
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,480
there are flags and early warning of

985
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,960
incidents of things going on within your

986
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,359
organization

987
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,720
plan to get hit there is a reality we

988
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,040
have

989
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,560
it's not a matter of if but when

990
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,880
and i wouldn't say plan to get hit in

991
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,720
terms of dei i would say look you're

992
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,760
going to struggle with this there are

993
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,880
going to be incidents

994
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,920
and be prepared to learn from them of

995
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,200
course you want to prevent them with

996
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,880
everything you can but be

997
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,040
prepared to learn from them and we see

998
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,160
unfortunately

999
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,400
play out in the public space a lot how

1000
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,160
organizations learn how to communicate

1001
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,119
around these

1002
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,560
because they fail publicly

1003
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,520
so there is a you know there's elements

1004
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,400
of ir

1005
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,200
in here too that could definitely be

1006
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,800
transplanted at least i think

1007
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,720
starting to explore this idea and i'll

1008
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,079
bring back the bonus points

1009
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,640
understanding history using models and

1010
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,640
frameworks to counter power dynamics

1011
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,359
you know the dni community is built

1012
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,599
pretty rigorously on a set of

1013
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,280
academic and sociological ideas

1014
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,760
thinking like your adversary and the

1015
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,280
importance of empathy

1016
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,720
and again producing data-driven

1017
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,240
intelligence lots of organizations when

1018
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,800
they think about dni metrics they just

1019
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,040
say how many women do we have how many

1020
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,280
people of color what's our lgbtq

1021
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,040
population and it's a good start

1022
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,760
it's a baseline but you are what you

1023
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,720
measure

1024
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,160
and so really having a clear sense of

1025
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,200
what the intelligence you're trying to

1026
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,040
get out what are your requirements

1027
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,240
is pretty important so i want to close

1028
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,280
by telling you what i tell myself

1029
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,480
and what you can too if

1030
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,640
you are and i hope you are trying to do

1031
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,800
this this work as well

1032
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,200
so the first is don't be an adversary um

1033
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,200
that's a little glib what i mean is you

1034
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,640
already know a lot about how to battle

1035
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:00,880
this

1036
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,119
issue and there's also no shame in

1037
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,240
acknowledging

1038
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,480
your vulnerabilities and where you need

1039
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,440
to patch

1040
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,880
where you need to patch your own

1041
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,880
personal operating system

1042
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,640
where your blind spots and additionally

1043
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,920
there's real power in

1044
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,760
understanding what is the talent that's

1045
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,200
around you and the

1046
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,200
value of psychological safety what that

1047
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,800
brings out in teams

1048
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,720
if you are interested in having a high

1049
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,320
performing team or being a part of a

1050
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,440
high performing team

1051
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,839
look for that

1052
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,960
the second and this is again what i tell

1053
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,400
myself is to leverage

1054
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,320
should be my leverage my privileged

1055
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,480
access

1056
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,520
so you know as

1057
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,040
a male as someone who speaks without

1058
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,280
who speaks english without an accent as

1059
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,400
in many other ways

1060
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,760
i have privileges i can leverage those

1061
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:57,119
and also partner with

1062
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,720
the folks in my organization i'm a

1063
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,960
manager and so i'm doing hiring

1064
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,640
and i can have the conversations around

1065
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,000
d e and i

1066
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
and some of the hard lessons we've

1067
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,280
learned about

1068
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,240
recruiting retaining and representing

1069
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,680
marginalized populations

1070
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,839
in in cyber security and the last

1071
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:19,200
and this isn't meant in a

1072
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,880
this is meant in a very authentic and

1073
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,880
sincere way but protection of resources

1074
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,240
requires investment

1075
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,920
that can be human resources it can be

1076
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,599
technological resources you cannot

1077
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:28,640
protect without

1078
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,160
investment and say differently

1079
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,560
and if you have worked in or you know

1080
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,160
people who work in finance this will

1081
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:36,880
resonate

1082
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,079
capital goes where it is safe

1083
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,839
human capital financial capital social

1084
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,520
capital it will go where it is safe

1085
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,720
and so i i tell myself these three

1086
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,440
things because

1087
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,280
i know them from a security standpoint

1088
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,640
and i also now

1089
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,319
i'm really starting to know and

1090
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,319
understand them from a diversity

1091
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,319
standpoint

1092
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,160
and when i'm in one room i can bring in

1093
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,560
the other

1094
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,079
so there is my framework in the

1095
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,079
beginning of this approach

1096
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,079
what i would really like to hear from

1097
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,119
you

1098
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,319
is what you think what am i missing i've

1099
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:15,920
made some assumptions lots of

1100
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,280
assumptions

1101
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,680
uh and is this something that you've

1102
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,040
come across

1103
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,720
you know i'm curious to have this

1104
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,400
conversation with you

1105
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,240
and i want to thank the diana initiative

1106
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,319
for giving me this opportunity i want to

1107
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,319
thank cheryl biswas personally she's

1108
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:32,960
been

1109
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,560
a really fantastic leader in the

1110
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,480
community and i want to thank you

1111
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,640
for spending this time with me

1112
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,640
thank you very much let's get to some

1113
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,040
questions

1114
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,040
thank you minish that was really

1115
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,640
really good i came back with a lot of

1116
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,839
takeaways and i'm sure

1117
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:58,800
that our audience did too uh one of the

1118
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,680
questions

1119
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,040
that we received was from megan carney

1120
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,319
and they said this there are not

1121
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:07,440
there are definitely security

1122
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,440
consequences for not having enough

1123
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,200
representation when implementing social

1124
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:11,839
media

1125
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,359
like putting in features that make

1126
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,119
stalking harassment easier

1127
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,839
do you see examples outside of that when

1128
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,000
non-diverse teams constrain defensive

1129
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,640
ideas

1130
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,119
like how to implement core things for

1131
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,400
example firewalls or ids

1132
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,480
interesting uh so there's like a few

1133
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,040
questions buried in here so this is

1134
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,640
this is cool this is cool let's get to

1135
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,520
the the core parts of it

1136
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,040
okay so i think um there's a few

1137
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,520
components the way i think about it

1138
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,880
the first is related to

1139
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,800
lived experiences and the ability to

1140
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,040
translate that into

1141
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,880
needs and that goes both with assessing

1142
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,400
threats but also

1143
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,359
prioritizing controls like megan was

1144
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,440
talking about firewalls and ids

1145
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,440
so let's break that down a little bit um

1146
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,720
uh depending on the the business or

1147
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,480
entity that you're a part of and who

1148
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,560
their customers or consumers or

1149
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,640
users or primary stakeholders

1150
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,480
beneficiaries are

1151
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,240
if you don't have representation of that

1152
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,440
group in your security organization

1153
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,599
good luck and i'm not saying that to be

1154
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,920
glib it's like you're gonna need luck

1155
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,040
because it's really challenging

1156
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,880
security already has a tough time trying

1157
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,319
to connect to

1158
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:33,040
to write the execution of the mission or

1159
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,880
the value of the business

1160
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,400
and so if you're missing those voices

1161
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,000
and those ideas

1162
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,640
um it's going to be really challenging

1163
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,000
the

1164
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,200
sorry the second is that was me saying

1165
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,920
make sure you're done um the second is

1166
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,280
um

1167
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,440
so stalking and harassment is a really

1168
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,200
good example

1169
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,319
at the same time megan i would say this

1170
00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:00,079
is something where

1171
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,640
you do you know we don't just want the

1172
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,280
group

1173
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,520
that is affected by it to have to

1174
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,000
represent and advocate for it

1175
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,200
and so um

1176
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,160
i think that is about having those

1177
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,839
voices in the right places and having

1178
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:17,440
the representation there

1179
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,400
but it's not the burden of it is on them

1180
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:20,880
the

1181
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,560
last that's in here that i think is

1182
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,480
really important is

1183
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:29,440
um non-diverse teams constrain defensive

1184
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,119
ideas

1185
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,960
so there

1186
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,760
it's gonna sound a little abstract but i

1187
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,640
personally

1188
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,560
like people who have come to security

1189
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,920
from different walks

1190
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:48,480
because they understand it from

1191
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,040
a very personal perspective and then

1192
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:51,599
also

1193
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:56,640
our uh think creatively about defense

1194
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,079
and insufficiencies in some of the

1195
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,640
defenses that we use and so when it

1196
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,000
comes to deploying a certain

1197
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,520
technology like actually deploying it

1198
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,200
that's not where i see the difference

1199
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,720
and i would argue that's kind of too

1200
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,680
late

1201
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,079
that's too far down the decision tree it

1202
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,680
should be further up when you're doing

1203
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,520
threat modeling

1204
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,960
when you're thinking about intelligence

1205
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,680
analysis uh horizon scanning

1206
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,560
and emerging threats fraud is a perfect

1207
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,240
example of where you want

1208
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,040
a real diversity of experiences because

1209
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,359
and i reluctantly admit this but

1210
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,400
cyber criminals are entrepreneurial and

1211
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,079
creative and so we need that to counter

1212
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:41,599
and um diversity is a font of creativity

1213
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:43,920
you know

1214
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,760
great question all right we had a second

1215
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,800
question

1216
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,240
from rt gaudiya and that was how do you

1217
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:52,720
deal

1218
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,480
with performative allies great question

1219
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,160
um i will articulate how i think about

1220
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,760
performative for people who may not be

1221
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,599
familiar and also to just to clarify a

1222
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,760
little bit

1223
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,599
performative is a lot what it sounds

1224
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:10,960
like performing

1225
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,000
going through the actions of being

1226
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,319
supportive towards diversity equity

1227
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,400
inclusion but not following through

1228
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,680
with not following through with it

1229
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,000
when it's really challenging or in some

1230
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,240
cases

1231
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,400
providing words or doing it in a public

1232
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,280
environment

1233
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,720
and not doing not doing the the

1234
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,040
making the difficult choices in private

1235
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,440
moments or the moments where they count

1236
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,839
um so i would say there's a couple

1237
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,640
things the first

1238
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,240
is uh

1239
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,400
pairing those

1240
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,040
actions like if you have control over a

1241
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,839
space where someone can come in as an

1242
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:58,640
ally um as much as possible

1243
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,319
pair the opportunity just to speak

1244
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,599
with opportunity to act and

1245
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,440
i mean this in that you know we all need

1246
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,000
allies we all need allies

1247
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,599
but we also can throttle a little bit

1248
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:15,119
when they can show up in our spaces

1249
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,880
so um

1250
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,480
i'll give you an example i had in grad

1251
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,200
school

1252
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,319
there was a a friend and classmate who

1253
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:28,160
was starting a group of women in

1254
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,000
security

1255
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,760
and she had put forth all this effort

1256
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,480
to organize for a career trip like just

1257
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,079
the best

1258
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,119
panels and experiences

1259
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:42,319
and then there was going to be like a

1260
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:45,200
networking event afterward

1261
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:49,040
and i said i know you can't exclude

1262
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,640
men but i think you should really

1263
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,400
emphasize and this i hope doesn't come

1264
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,760
across as mansplaining it really wasn't

1265
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,240
i was trying to be in my role as an ally

1266
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,760
and say i can go talk to some of my

1267
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,680
classmates and say let's try and respect

1268
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,079
the space or whatever else

1269
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:05,200
and and the sense was

1270
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,880
you know someone could show up and say

1271
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,480
that they were going to

1272
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,640
yes they're be there to support their

1273
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,720
female classmates but actually just take

1274
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,000
advantage

1275
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,280
um so i think the first is about pairing

1276
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,079
that those words and the actions the

1277
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:20,720
second

1278
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,680
is creating mechanisms of accountability

1279
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,200
and to bring it back to security for a

1280
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,040
second if we talk about identity

1281
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,200
authentication authorization

1282
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,160
accountability

1283
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,279
allows that auditing

1284
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:36,559
accountability and transparency

1285
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:40,000
is how you counter power in lots of ways

1286
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,240
right that's how we the maker checker or

1287
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,440
that's that's how we

1288
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,000
oversee administrative controls to make

1289
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,119
sure that they're okay from an

1290
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,200
audit perspective and i think it's it's

1291
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,640
very much the same

1292
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,079
um so that hey i hope it's okay i'm

1293
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:54,640
gonna

1294
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,400
use more of the technical language here

1295
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,000
a user cannot perform

1296
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,280
an authorized action without it being

1297
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,839
audited without it being auditable

1298
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:05,520
right without there being some evidence

1299
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,200
to be able to examine

1300
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,319
you made this commitment or you perform

1301
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:11,599
this action

1302
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:14,559
what is the result of it um that's a

1303
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:15,839
little abstract so i'll

1304
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:17,680
i'll say one other thing that is not

1305
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,599
abstract and very like interpersonal and

1306
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:20,800
secure

1307
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,839
um i have in the past

1308
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:27,839
tried to confront that person

1309
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,400
with empathy and talking to them about

1310
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,839
spaces where they've needed allies

1311
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:37,680
so my belief is that

1312
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,680
everyone at some point has been part of

1313
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,839
a minority group

1314
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:43,599
at some point some people it's like

1315
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:44,880
everything all the time

1316
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,680
they're part of so many groups but even

1317
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,640
people who are part of

1318
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,240
a privileged group at some point they've

1319
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,680
been part of minority group and to

1320
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,280
access that moment

1321
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,640
and say when it was just you and you

1322
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,480
were the only person of you

1323
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,559
in that room in that space and you had

1324
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:00,960
to speak on behalf of

1325
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,480
wouldn't have been nice if would how can

1326
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,599
you use

1327
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:07,839
your experience there to make you a

1328
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,680
better ally

1329
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,280
another excellent question thank you

1330
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,760
and i think that brings us to time so

1331
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,119
thank you so much for being part of the

1332
