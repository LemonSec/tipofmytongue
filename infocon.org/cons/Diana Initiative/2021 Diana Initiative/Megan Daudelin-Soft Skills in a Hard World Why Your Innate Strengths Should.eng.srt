their security posture

45

sadly we had a few technological bumps

46
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,520

a recording we're going to give you now

49
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,599
thank you all for being here thank our

50
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,800
sponsors

51
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,879
thank all the attendants

52
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:33,680
you

53
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,400
have made this an incredible

54
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,040
event i'll see you around thank you and

55
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,840
here's megan

56
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,239
of course for attending this wonderful

57
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,560
event

58
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,720
hi everyone let me start by saying

59
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,400
thanks for tuning in

60
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,879
i'll admit that as many times as i've

61
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,360
imagined my first conference talk

62
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,680
it never looked quite like this

63
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,680
that said i have a lot of appreciation

64
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,280
now for what we've learned about

65
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,760
virtualizing opportunities like this and

66
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,200
i hope we can carry these lessons

67
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,280
forward into the future even when we can

68
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,360
be back in person

69
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,120
i think hybrid events will only improve

70
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,120
participation and engagement by

71
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,599
increasing accessibility

72
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,440
i also want to thank the organizers of

73
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,280
the diana initiative for putting on such

74
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,599
a fantastic event as well as the

75
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,080
sponsors for seeing and backing the

76
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,360
vision

77
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,840
a particular shout out to my employer

78
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,640
ine for being a diamond sponsor and

79
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,879
supporting me in my topic of choice

80
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,720
even though it has little to do with my

81
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,000
job or their offerings

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,400
now to introduce myself my name is meg

83
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,000
doddlin and i've been in the industry

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,879
for a bit over nine years i started my

85
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,519
career in digital forensics and to me

86
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,360
that really is an important piece of

87
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,840
context for this conversation

88
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,920
while the forensic analysis i was doing

89
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,560
had technical components the majority of

90
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,640
the effort and its value was in the

91
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,239
analysis

92
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,319
reading together bits of data into a

93
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,280
comprehensive story about each user

94
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,400
i adored that work making the data make

95
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,879
sense first myself and then to others

96
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,040
through my reporting

97
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,279
but then life happened and i had to find

98
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,279
a new role in a region without many

99
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,798
forensic jobs

100
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,880
and that's when i first ventured outside

101
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,880
the forensic sub-discipline into the

102
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,440
broader world of cyber security

103
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,440
over the next several years i hopped

104
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,600
from enterprise security to security

105
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,160
content development to a sort of ctf

106
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,400
engineering role to curriculum design to

107
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,479
security consulting

108
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,479
point is i've dabbled in a bunch of

109
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,960
areas within cyber security

110
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,120
and yet i would never describe myself as

111
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,040
a technical person

112
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,280
and before you uh and think i'm being

113
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,120
self-deprecating or underestimating

114
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,520
myself like others have when i've said

115
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,758
i'm not

116
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,479
a long time ago that i'll never be a

117
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,000
technical person

118
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,120
i'm simply not here for the tech

119
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,039
i'm not a hardware collector i don't

120
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,960
mess with software or networking in my

121
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,039
free time i've never done a techie

122
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,360
competition on my off days

123
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,360
tech is not my hobby

124
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,199
but when i first started college i got

125
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,759
the impression that it had to be

126
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,240
all my confident peers seemed to be into

127
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,000
that part of things

128
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,160
and the fact that i was consistently top

129
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,639
in our classes didn't spare me from

130
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,320
feeling foolish when they'd bring up

131
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,919
some new gadget i had never heard of

132
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,400
and when we talk about technical people

133
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,160
you all know who i'm talking about or

134
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,840
maybe you are one

135
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,360
when a colleague asks about them

136
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,479
everyone says

137
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,960
oh yeah they're so good or at this

138
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,360
hardware and this software

139
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,120
they write this language faster than

140
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,440
i've ever seen they place ctfs on the

141
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,639
weekends and have gotten six

142
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,880
certifications this month

143
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,639
their home network is defended by three

144
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,720
firewalls and they perform vulnerability

145
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,960
scans every night they have a server

146
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,479
rack in their basement with liquid

147
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,600
cooling

148
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
and here i am just hoping that's still a

149
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,199
thing

150
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,720
you know the ones

151
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,440
we love them we need them but we can't

152
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,880
all be them

153
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,720
and i'm not them

154
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,759
trying to be them to fake that love of

155
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,080
technology has only affected me

156
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,080
negatively in the past

157
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,759
nothing gets my imposter syndrome

158
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,680
nagging faster than trying to be someone

159
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,280
i'm not

160
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,039
i considered quitting my undergrad

161
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,120
program several times

162
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,800
crying on the phone to my mom more times

163
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,560
than i could count

164
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,240
it took me a while to realize that i

165
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,199
don't even want to be that person

166
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,360
i'm happy to use my technical skills

167
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,919
however needed and to learn more more of

168
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:54,800
them

169
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,120
but those aren't the skills that fulfill

170
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,360
me that make me feel worthy and

171
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,120
successful

172
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,039
every job i've had has required me to

173
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,520
learn a new set of technical skills

174
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,680
but at the end of the day those are not

175
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,440
what have made me an effective or

176
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,000
appreciated employee

177
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,160
and now you're all wondering so what is

178
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,360
she good at well honestly many of the

179
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,680
skills i now hold most here

180
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,000
are things that i

181
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,599
saw as weaknesses or that i tried to

182
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,280
hide in the past

183
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,360
my almost annoyingly analytical and

184
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,680
critical mind allows me to see the gaps

185
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,400
and ask the questions that others don't

186
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,319
my extracurricular experience with

187
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,639
writing and public speaking allows me to

188
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,400
communicate with anyone regardless of

189
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,639
their technical know-how

190
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,120
my innate self-awareness that

191
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,960
sometimes still simmers over into

192
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,520
self-doubt allows me to appreciate and

193
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,240
leverage the brilliance of my colleagues

194
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,520
who i am inside who i am despite years

195
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,759
of technical training is what makes me

196
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,759
successful

197
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,440
and maybe some of these

198
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,080
soft skills resonate with you

199
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,160
or maybe you have other ones maybe you

200
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,800
are a project management superstar with

201
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,960
an immutable knack for keeping track of

202
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,199
components and dependencies

203
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,199
maybe you inspire teams with your quiet

204
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,960
leadership everywhere you go just

205
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,120
establishing communication and building

206
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,639
trust

207
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,240
maybe you can't help but make others

208
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,479
feel more confident and capable

209
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,240
improving your colleagues performance

210
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,879
just with your presence

211
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,319
maybe all your friends and colleagues

212
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,319
turn to you for career advice because

213
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,440
you have a way of cutting through the

214
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,360
wishy-washiness and seeing their core

215
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,640
needs

216
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,080
maybe they all come to you when things

217
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,719
go wrong because no one can break down a

218
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,679
problem and move forward better

219
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,360
maybe you're the go-to sounding board

220
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,279
because you can listen and reflect

221
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,080
without judgment or imposition

222
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,160
all of these and so many more are

223
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,920
examples of where our non-technical

224
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,760
skills are what make us invaluable

225
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,120
and then there's all the non-technical

226
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,360
skills that act as buzzwords and job

227
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,200
descriptions but are never adequately

228
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,440
measured or evaluated

229
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,880
how many times have you read the job

230
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,480
description that gets posted for a new

231
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,279
member of your own team only to think

232
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,880
well i don't think they need to know all

233
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,480
that

234
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,640
too many times

235
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,399
yet so many of my friends and colleagues

236
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,240
over the years have acknowledged that

237
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,000
they would always rather work with

238
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,279
someone who is

239
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,839
eager and adaptable resilient and

240
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,560
curious respectful and collaborative

241
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,240
than someone who knows

242
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,399
some thing

243
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,320
and yet for all the interviews i've been

244
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,839
part of as either the interviewee or

245
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,120
interviewer questions about those skills

246
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,200
just get awkward

247
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,040
so when have you faced a challenge at

248
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,480
work and how did you handle it or what

249
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,399
did you do about it

250
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,240
is that's a question supposed to provide

251
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,200
an adequate answer into my potential

252
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
why aren't we finding better ways to

253
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,360
lead that conversation to understand a

254
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,519
person's core potential to understand

255
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,680
the gaps they could fill on a team or in

256
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,480
an organization

257
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,000
but here we are

258
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,760
technical skills have long been the

259
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,440
focus of training and development

260
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,000
programs within cyber security probably

261
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,360
because they've always been the metric

262
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,040
by which candidates and employees are

263
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,560
evaluated

264
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,160
non-technical skills are all but

265
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,480
overlooked during the hiring process

266
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,839
simply glossed over in the job

267
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,680
description and hardly mentioned during

268
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,040
interviews

269
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,040
to be fair technical skills are easier

270
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,720
to evaluate

271
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,320
they can be yes or no questions or

272
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,279
perhaps a scale from beginner to expert

273
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,880
they can be readily compared in a

274
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,640
quantitative manner

275
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,640
non-technical skills are incredibly

276
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,839
subjective

277
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,000
yet in workplaces around the world

278
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,079
they're what make the difference between

279
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,360
acceptable

280
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,519
and exceptional

281
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,360
teams that learn how to leverage and

282
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,120
empower people for their non-technical

283
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,279
skills are the ones that surpass

284
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,880
expectations

285
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,320
teams that don't

286
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,480
feel it

287
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,959
being measured by evaluated against

288
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,200
valued for skills that i don't enjoy

289
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,760
using has contributed significantly to

290
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,839
periods of discontent

291
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,440
being in that situation leaves me

292
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,240
feeling drained just dragging myself

293
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,160
along and i started hearing the same

294
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,519
from friends and colleagues once i

295
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,480
started opening up about it myself

296
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,920
this disconnect can leave people in

297
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,200
technical roles feeling not quite right

298
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,880
it's that feeling that leads to bringing

299
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,600
up the job boards 3 6 12 months into a

300
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,120
new role

301
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,720
it's what happens when the facts of the

302
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,040
role or the culture just don't line up

303
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,040
with our true selves

304
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,720
sure sometimes it's the technical skills

305
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,240
or opportunities that make a person

306
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,880
leave a job but in my experience it's

307
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,120
more often been a disregard for the

308
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,720
pieces of self that really make an

309
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,120
employee unique that's what leaves them

310
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,440
feeling out of place

311
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,360
i'm not suggesting that it's possible to

312
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,200
always love a job

313
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,600
however if the role aligns to who you

314
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,160
are beyond your technical skills

315
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,120
the days at least won't be dreaded

316
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,200
there is significant opportunity in our

317
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,279
field to enhance recruitment and career

318
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,360
progression efforts by looking at all

319
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,519
the non-technical skills that a role or

320
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,200
a team requires

321
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,839
and understanding

322
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,279
and and an understanding of team

323
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,240
dynamics and non-technical skill gaps

324
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,000
can assist in finding employees or

325
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,600
opportunities that provide the greatest

326
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,079
sense of satisfaction

327
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,920
truth be told a readjustment of this

328
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,240
type is also likely to improve diversity

329
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,399
and inclusion in hiring

330
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,240
as a byproduct of growing up in modern

331
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,040
society women develop many skills that

332
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,680
men simply aren't required to

333
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,920
we naturally become better communicators

334
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,000
and collaborators tend to be better at

335
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,399
maintaining objectivity and more easily

336
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,399
understand the connections between

337
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,399
individuals teams and projects

338
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,480
why aren't technical roles hiring for

339
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,639
these skills the ones that are harder to

340
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,680
teach

341
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,240
technology can be taught but many of the

342
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,399
non-technical skills are about who we

343
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,800
are rather than what we know

344
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,480
it's time we're all encouraged to be

345
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,639
proud of these skill sets and that

346
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,480
training and development in these areas

347
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,240
become a normal part of career

348
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,360
progression for all employees

349
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,040
from there job descriptions and

350
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,959
interviews can genuinely focus on a

351
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,959
candidate's potential and the unique

352
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,120
gaps they could fill on a team rather

353
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,200
than a list of awkward questions like

354
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,160
have you handled this technology before

355
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,920
we all know that years of experience

356
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,440
don't translate directly into

357
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,920
effectiveness especially in an industry

358
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,680
that evolves as rapidly as cyber

359
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,120
security

360
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,760
sebastian ramirez succinctly summarized

361
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,440
this shortcoming last summer when he

362
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,440
reflected on twitter that he had seen a

363
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,760
job post requiring four or more years of

364
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,399
experience with fast api

365
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,480
something that he didn't even have since

366
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,240
it had been less than two years since he

367
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,120
created it

368
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,959
there's already some progress trending

369
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,720
in this direction

370
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,399
multiple technology companies have

371
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,240
publicly stated that they'd be removing

372
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,560
degrees from their job requirements

373
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,160
and that's great because we all know

374
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,320
that a degree and capability don't

375
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,320
always go hand in hand

376
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,399
but now it's time to start moving away

377
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,480
from being overly specific with the

378
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,720
technical skills and job descriptions

379
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,800
and instead evaluating technical

380
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,040
knowledge against a baseline of minimum

381
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,639
requirements

382
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,160
job requirements should be the minimum

383
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,320
necessary to be successful not

384
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,480
everything the employer hopes and dreams

385
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,560
of finding in a unicorn

386
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,279
because yes the company may be using one

387
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,279
technology today but that might change

388
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,040
tomorrow

389
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,279
sure maybe they're a juniper shop today

390
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,800
but what happens when a project to

391
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,320
replace it with a cisco infrastructure

392
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,839
gets approved

393
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,720
employers already expect us to adapt and

394
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,800
learn to keep pace with the industry and

395
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,959
with organizational decisions

396
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,839
so why not recruit based on those skills

397
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,160
the skills that bolster a team that

398
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,040
enable efficiency and effectiveness

399
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,639
having the opportunity to use and

400
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,880
develop those skills the ones that make

401
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,519
each employee uniquely themselves

402
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,360
that improves job satisfaction and

403
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,519
workplace culture which in turn reduces

404
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,120
turnover

405
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,800
those are the skills i want to be

406
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,040
interviewed about those are the skills

407
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,560
that should set candidates apart

408
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,199
but change can be slow so what do we do

409
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,560
in the meantime

410
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,199
how do we emphasize our greatest assets

411
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,600
while the tide is still turning

412
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,040
before we can do that we need to

413
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,320
understand what our innate strengths are

414
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,560
what skills make us unique what skills

415
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,160
fulfill us

416
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,240
it can also also help to understand what

417
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,240
conditions we're most effective under

418
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,240
and how to adapt any role requirements

419
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,639
to fit ourselves

420
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,880
long before i got started on my

421
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,440
rambling road into cyber security i held

422
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,839
one of my favorite jobs

423
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,399
for several summers i waited tables

424
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,800
i loved that work and i've always said i

425
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,639
would enjoy doing it again

426
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,320
it wasn't until recently that i gave

427
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,079
much thought to why

428
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,519
what i figured out is that i felt

429
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,120
incredibly functional in that

430
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,399
environment

431
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,040
it turns out i am a task and objective

432
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,360
oriented person waiting tables is

433
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,000
perfect for me in that way clear tasks

434
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,880
clear outcomes clear deadlines

435
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,759
working in ambiguity is exhausting to me

436
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,639
i like order and structure

437
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,560
recognizing this about myself gave me

438
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,120
back some power i could start applying

439
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,880
structure to an unstructured work

440
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,519
environment even if just for myself

441
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,120
making me more effective and more

442
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,800
productive

443
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,959
onto my professional career i've already

444
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,160
mentioned that performing digital

445
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,839
forensic analysis is where i got my

446
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:34,800
start

447
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,040
when i considered why i enjoyed that

448
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,519
work so much i realized that it let me

449
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,680
be the processor that i am

450
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,600
i got to take vast amounts of

451
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,680
disconnected information and tie it all

452
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,079
together into a cohesive story

453
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,240
i also got to share that story turning

454
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,279
chaos into value for others

455
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,360
that same concept echoes in my teaching

456
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,040
and technical editing

457
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,920
as both a professor and editor i get to

458
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,920
take complicated concepts and help them

459
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,240
make sense to others i get to use my

460
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,559
skill at seeing others perspectives to

461
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,240
determine whether a particular

462
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,480
explanation or definition or paragraph

463
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,640
will make sense to them

464
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,240
i can see when things are jumping too

465
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,559
far ahead without laying the necessary

466
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,400
foundation and help fill those gaps

467
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,439
but when you're trying to better

468
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,280
understand yourself don't limit your

469
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,119
thinking to the workplace

470
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,039
sure those were some examples of

471
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,880
responsibilities or roles that really

472
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,880
let me shine but there are also plenty

473
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,720
of examples outside of work that speak

474
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,720
to who i am

475
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,440
i adore reading fiction often going

476
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,600
through at least a few books a week

477
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,760
my all-time favorite author is stephen

478
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,000
king not for the horror but for the

479
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,360
complexity

480
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,919
i like having to figure things out to

481
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,440
see connections between discrete

482
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,799
information

483
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,799
the way mr king's anthology can be tied

484
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,280
together one book after the next lets me

485
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,080
find my way through a new world

486
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,840
my interest in certain video games

487
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,480
trends in the same direction i'm

488
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,880
awful at combat games but i love an

489
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,360
immersive world with complexity and its

490
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,320
own set of rules and a unique history

491
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,440
i believe this speaks to my

492
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,160
resourcefulness and creativity i thrive

493
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,120
on innovative solutions that ask what if

494
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,039
while not losing sight of the problem or

495
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,720
the objective

496
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,320
i'm the one that wants to understand the

497
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,160
status quo well enough to apply

498
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,080
thoughtful change that won't have

499
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,559
unexpected consequences

500
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,320
i also love to cook

501
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,240
what's more task and objective oriented

502
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,679
than a recipe

503
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,480
it gives me a clear list of resources

504
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,799
steps time to complete and expected

505
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,240
outcome

506
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,000
and then on top of that foundational

507
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,919
layer of following instructions comes

508
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,160
the opportunity to get creative to wing

509
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,039
it

510
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,880
it's everything education is supposed to

511
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,120
be crawl walk run

512
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,960
layering knowledge and skills and past

513
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,440
experience into something new

514
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,880
now i lucked into some of these

515
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,039
realizations and even then it took me

516
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,720
some time to figure out

517
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,320
to understand how these concepts of

518
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,280
myself could be reflected in my work

519
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,760
how to find roles or teams that not only

520
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,640
let me be myself but wanted to leverage

521
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,320
me for those aspects of myself that had

522
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,799
nothing to do with my technical skills

523
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,480
i want to encourage everyone here

524
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,480
regardless of where you are in your

525
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,880
career or life to give yourself the

526
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,200
opportunity to reflect on who you are

527
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,000
and what brings you contentment

528
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,640
what in your life past or present has

529
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,480
let you lay down at night with a calm

530
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,600
mind

531
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,400
what adequately exercises your mind

532
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,960
flexes your innate strengths such that

533
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,880
you feel content and fulfilled at the

534
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,400
end of the day

535
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,400
and whatever answers you come up with

536
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,799
try to boil them down further we can't

537
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,799
all read books or play video games as

538
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,120
our job so we need to understand what it

539
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,280
is about those fulfilling activities

540
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,679
that makes them fulfill us

541
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,520
from there there's opportunity to start

542
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,280
applying your strengths to your current

543
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,240
roles

544
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,760
as well as pitching them in future

545
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,080
interviews

546
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,600
knowing your innate strengths can give

547
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,000
some context to what is or isn't working

548
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,080
well for you in a role and understanding

549
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,080
that can let you either buckle down and

550
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,240
endure or find a way to adjust the

551
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,640
situation to fit yourself

552
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,480
in my experience it can be easier to

553
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,720
survive a less than ideal role than to

554
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,679
land a new one that's better suited

555
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,280
there's lots of great advice out there

556
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,960
to help you land an interview by

557
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,559
improving your resume or leveraging

558
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,480
colleague referrals but what about

559
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,240
during the interview

560
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,240
how can you handle questions that might

561
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,840
not be directly related to your

562
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,840
strengths so you still come out looking

563
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,400
like a strong candidate

564
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,000
for me this was a challenge i had to

565
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,480
overcome quite early in my career

566
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,320
my technical knowledge was limited when

567
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,880
i was looking for my first role outside

568
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,200
of digital forensics so i really had to

569
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,520
emphasize my other skills

570
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,200
there were plenty of interviews that did

571
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,039
not go my way but the thing that

572
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,960
resonated amongst all the interviews

573
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,280
that felt successful was my ability to

574
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,400
focus on my non-technical skills even

575
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,159
with a technical question

576
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,840
if i didn't know the answer or wasn't

577
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,760
familiar with the topic i very

578
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,080
intentionally said that i didn't know

579
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,919
but then also voiced my eagerness to

580
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,760
learn and drew connections to similar

581
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,080
technologies or concepts

582
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,919
for example in the interview that landed

583
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,640
me my first job outside of forensics i

584
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,240
relied heavily on relating cyber

585
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,360
security to digital forensics

586
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,760
i emphasized how my experience analyzing

587
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,679
hosts and networks from a forensic

588
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,000
perspective prepared me to detect

589
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,600
anomalous behavior that could be

590
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,400
indicative of an intrusion or infection

591
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,240
i didn't have actual experience doing

592
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,480
intrusion or malware analysis but i

593
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,159
certainly knew what a healthy state

594
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,679
looked like

595
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,080
i got to focus on my adaptability and my

596
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,400
ability to apply related concepts to a

597
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,159
new problem

598
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,600
so when you're preparing for your next

599
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,080
interview especially if the requirements

600
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,840
or responsibilities are on the fringes

601
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,280
of your experience

602
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,120
think about how everything you've done

603
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,600
or learned how everything you are

604
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,840
applies to the role

605
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,919
maybe you've never been a stock analyst

606
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,679
but you have an eye for anomalies and

607
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,159
you excel at data refinement

608
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,559
maybe you're in i.t wanting to move into

609
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,559
something more security centric and sure

610
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,240
you don't have experience with security

611
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,000
automation but you've been scripting

612
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,679
automation for your current job for

613
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,760
years

614
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,679
women in particular are prone to seeing

615
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,600
a list of job requirements as a boolean

616
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,960
argument

617
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,600
all trues mean i'm qualified but any

618
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,840
falses mean i'm not

619
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,919
which is why there's opportunity for us

620
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,679
if we can get past the literal

621
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,000
interpretation of job requirements to

622
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,159
understand the non-technical skills that

623
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,440
would make someone successful in the

624
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,480
role

625
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,120
from there we can tailor our resumes

626
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,200
leverage our colleagues and sell our

627
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,280
uniqueness and interviews

628
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,440
we'll always be more successful and more

629
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,919
fulfilled in a role that resonates with

630
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,240
our true selves so let's use those

631
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,480
innate strengths to find roles on teams

632
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,840
that will love us for them

633
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,679
and that's what i've had on my mind

634
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,600
especially as i've been acclimating to a

635
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,440
role that wants me to be more visible

636
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,600
and to share more broadly

637
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,360
my first reaction when that idea came up

638
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,159
was

639
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,039
but i don't have anything to talk about

640
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,960
it took some reflection to realize that

641
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,720
i made the assumption that i had to be

642
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,640
talking about tech to bring a valuable

643
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,840
perspective to share a useful story

644
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,000
but that's not who i am

645
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,159
so instead i'm sharing something

646
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,159
meaningful to me that i hope will become

647
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,240
a bigger conversation

648
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,400
i hope something here has resonated with

649
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,880
you and i would be so glad to hear your

650
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,880
thoughts or your reactions if you want

651
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,799
to drop me a note or tell me all about

652
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,120
your strengths

653
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,440
thank you so much for joining me today

654
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,360
and of course for attending this

655
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,840
wonderful event
