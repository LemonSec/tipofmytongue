1
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:14,639
all right

2
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,160
we should be live the delay should be

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,400
good

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,960
hello all of you wonderful people who

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,400
have been here for two days

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,720
we're closing down the diana initiative

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,160
i really want to thank everybody for

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,519
spending time with us

9
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,960
um if you were over in the career

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,279
village you probably saw me quite a bit

11
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,360
i am really happy to be accepted as a

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,840
presenter today as we start to wind down

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,840
what has been a fantastic conference

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,680
from everything that i've seen

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,680
so i'm here to talk about reimagining

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,120
cyber security careers um

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,559
so a lot of the themes that have been

18
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,079
presented by various

19
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,760
uh speakers are probably gonna be

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,440
present in this so

21
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,840
we're gonna jump right in there is the

22
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,600
closing keynote after me

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,120
and then i think some sort of a happy

24
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,640
hour but uh

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,000
you know hopefully you'll stay with us

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,680
through the very end of everything

27
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,760
it's been such a great conference

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,680
overall i've learned a lot

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,520
and hopefully everybody has gotten a lot

30
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,280
out of the conference

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,799
so let's get started so again i'd like

32
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,640
to thank the sponsors i'm on staff here

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,080
so i have to have the sponsor slide we

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,840
cannot do this without the sponsors

35
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,360
so thank you to all the sponsors of the

36
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,600
conference um i hope

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,680
to see all these team sponsors next year

38
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,119
and hopefully will be in person

39
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,560
which will be exciting because i've only

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,159
done the diana initiative virtually

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,920
i'm not going to spend a lot of time on

42
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,479
who i am i served for 10 years in the us

43
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,079
army i did a lot of cool stuff that i

44
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,280
can't talk about

45
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,280
and i have pivoted to cyber security so

46
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,880
i've been in cyber security roles for

47
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,280
about

48
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,399
11 and a half years roughly

49
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,000
i have some certifications i have some

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,079
education i spent a while getting my

51
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,399
associate's degree and i had enough and

52
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,000
i got back into coaching soccer

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,520
which is really one of the things i love

54
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,759
to do and i really like to help out

55
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,840
all these sorts of career events and and

56
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,880
villages and

57
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,719
and help all of you people get the jobs

58
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,079
that you want right

59
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,600
that's one of the things i love to do

60
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,040
when i help somebody and then like they

61
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,479
messaged me and they're like we got

62
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,479
i got a job like that's so amazing

63
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,879
because there it seems so hard

64
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,520
to get into cyber security so that's

65
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,959
kind of what this talk is about a little

66
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,480
bit

67
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,879
right so there's this problem and i know

68
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,560
this is not a new problem

69
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,080
right and i'm not the first person to

70
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,680
talk about this but

71
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,160
this is also a call to action so i'm

72
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,160
going to talk about some of the problems

73
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,480
with the careers here but it is also a

74
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,680
call to action

75
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,080
like we are the cyber security community

76
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,800
you me

77
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,400
if you're here you volunteer in the

78
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,000
community you're going to defcon

79
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,160
or you're attending virtually and you

80
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,280
have a

81
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,800
a job in it or cyber security

82
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,640
right we might not be the hiring manager

83
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,000
and we might not interact with the

84
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,360
hiring

85
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,000
departments and hr on a routine regular

86
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,879
basis but we

87
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,959
could we could try to be more involved

88
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,720
so a lot of my presentation is these are

89
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,760
some of the problems

90
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,760
but also a call to action so that we can

91
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,280
start to proactively address these

92
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,120
problems because we are the cyber

93
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,599
security industry

94
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,159
so a lot of people have talked about

95
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,080
some of these things and i'm i'm not a

96
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,959
huge fan

97
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,800
of the entry level job requirements

98
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,319
we've seen these they've been posted on

99
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:16,879
twitter

100
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,000
we'd we had other presenters today speak

101
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,480
about

102
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,560
these problems with the entry-level job

103
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,680
requirements

104
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,080
um and there's a lot of ridiculous job

105
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,920
requirements that is essentially a form

106
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,720
of gate

107
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,640
gatekeeping it's not always an

108
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,000
intentional form of gatekeeping

109
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,720
but it is it is a form of gatekeeping

110
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,319
and when i say that some of this is a

111
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,680
call to action

112
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,040
i'm going to try to point out a couple

113
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,519
of things that hopefully can help

114
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,640
us improve the process so my second

115
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,000
bullet here is i have

116
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,599
been a hiring manager in a couple of

117
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,480
different roles that i have had

118
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,959
you would think that bringing someone

119
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,040
into an organization is probably

120
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,480
one of the most important things that we

121
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,319
do as an organization

122
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,680
but i've never had any informal or

123
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,159
formal training on how to be a hiring

124
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,280
manager

125
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,040
and i think that that trend is probably

126
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,280
going to be true where very few people

127
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,080
who are the decision maker for hiring

128
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,560
have

129
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,320
any formal training on this process

130
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,399
to make them better at that aspect of

131
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,440
their job

132
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,880
and i think that's one of the things

133
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,720
that we ought to sort of like push back

134
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,280
on

135
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,360
when we are promoted or get into a

136
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,960
management role where we're hiring

137
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,840
people

138
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,240
like where is the where's the additional

139
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,919
support and training and mentorship for

140
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,199
how we should be doing this

141
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,080
better to improve the hiring process i

142
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,840
found that the hiring managers

143
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,560
don't necessarily really work with the

144
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,240
hr department a lot which

145
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,160
is kind of interesting like yes there's

146
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,440
some interaction there

147
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,080
but there's not like a lot of a lot of

148
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,160
communication ahead of time and sharing

149
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,840
like best practices

150
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,360
i didn't encounter any of that in the

151
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,360
roles i've had as a hiring manager

152
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,320
i proactively you know went and read and

153
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,680
tried to learn on my own

154
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,240
but i think that's one area that we can

155
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,000
try to push for improvements

156
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,400
on the other thing is that a lot of

157
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,240
hiring managers

158
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,320
seem to be unwilling to hire someone

159
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,639
with sort of no paid experience in the

160
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,120
job

161
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,080
even for a role that's junior so there

162
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,840
are all of these unfilled

163
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,440
entry level and junior roles in the

164
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,199
industry and

165
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,039
there's a whole bunch of people that i

166
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,199
see at all of these events i attend and

167
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,039
in the community trying to get these

168
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,000
jobs

169
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,320
so there's a disconnect there are people

170
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,520
who want the jobs

171
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,840
the jobs are open and they remain

172
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,880
unfilled

173
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,560
and we're going to talk about this term

174
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,800
passion we're going to talk about that

175
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,000
in a couple other slides

176
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,400
because i think that ties in to this

177
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,199
problem

178
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,080
and a form of gatekeeping in particular

179
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,919
another thing that we can try to push

180
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:50,400
for

181
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,280
to improve cyber security careers is as

182
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,400
the industry

183
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,960
we can try to push for and advocate for

184
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,600
through our

185
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,919
management chains for more modern

186
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,440
apprenticeships and more paid

187
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,479
internships

188
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,560
right some companies especially some of

189
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,080
the bigger companies

190
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,759
have some paid internships and those

191
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,440
paid internships can turn into entry

192
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,560
level jobs

193
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,720
but not enough companies or

194
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,000
organizations

195
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,880
have those programs in place to help the

196
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,600
pipeline

197
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,680
of getting those junior people into the

198
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,720
industry

199
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,639
when there are no junior people in the

200
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,759
industry

201
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,280
that creates a whole bunch of other

202
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,120
problems that we see because now there

203
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,039
is more work for the people who do work

204
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:29,600
there

205
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,360
and at some point some of those people

206
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,039
are going to retire or quit

207
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,919
and burn out but we aren't we don't have

208
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,759
the pipeline if we can't fill the

209
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,160
junior roles to backfill the people that

210
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,440
are getting promoted

211
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,639
or moving on or retiring or quitting

212
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,280
because they're

213
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,400
too burnt out the other big one that i

214
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,479
think is pretty problematic

215
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,720
is that a lot of cyber security careers

216
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,000
sort of lack

217
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,479
structure and when i talk to junior

218
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,080
people who are getting into this field

219
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,199
from college or just

220
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,160
entering it uh from a different career

221
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,360
cyber security

222
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,720
as an overall field can be very flexible

223
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,520
in how you want to shape your career but

224
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,360
i think a lot of junior and mid-level

225
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,080
staff

226
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,319
find this really problematic because it

227
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,360
is so flexible

228
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,599
because you can make it whatever you

229
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,919
want so it's not like philosophy

230
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,039
or law where there's like long long

231
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,280
histories of how those careers will work

232
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,039
depending on what you want to do

233
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,120
like cyber security is maybe 20 years

234
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,759
old

235
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,560
right so this is a brand new field and

236
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:34,960
and

237
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,400
i'm going to talk about that career

238
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,199
structure a little bit in a few slides

239
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,120
but these entry-level job requirements

240
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,880
are bad we know they're bad

241
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,800
i think we should be calling them out

242
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,720
more when we see them

243
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,560
some very prominent people do call them

244
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,759
out on twitter

245
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,440
but i'm almost to the point where i

246
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,280
think we should to some extent if we're

247
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,560
in a comfortable position

248
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,599
ourselves as industry personnel

249
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,520
maybe at some point we want to i don't

250
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,280
know that name and shame

251
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,680
but i mean we probably know some people

252
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,599
with those organizations that have

253
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,000
these jobs and and at some point maybe

254
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,599
we should be advocating

255
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,240
the with the right points of contact

256
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,919
that this is not appropriate

257
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,800
right this job does not require oscp for

258
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,120
an

259
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,680
entry-level pen test role like oscp is

260
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,520
not an entry-level certification for a

261
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,560
pen testing job

262
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,680
cisp should never be on even a lot of

263
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,199
mid-level jobs

264
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,160
so the wish list the wish list job

265
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,199
requirements

266
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,120
are also affecting diversity right

267
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,559
and i'm going to talk about that in a

268
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,719
minute as well this is happening for a

269
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:39,760
couple of reasons

270
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,880
in my opinion the hiring manager isn't

271
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,919
writing the job wreck

272
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,360
focused on the critical skills needed

273
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,760
for the job they're writing a wish list

274
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,360
right they're writing this wish list

275
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,800
because they want to hire a

276
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,440
rock star or a unicorn or whatever term

277
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,800
they have in their mind

278
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,839
to fill this role and maybe the person

279
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,279
who wrote the job requirement really

280
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,800
doesn't understand the role either

281
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,040
i have seen all of these things play out

282
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,200
and i have tried to advise

283
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,440
at certain times in my career to take

284
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,040
things off that job requirement

285
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,279
and and i was not they did not take my

286
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,200
advice and they continued to list the

287
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
issp for a job that did not require

288
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,480
cissp

289
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,120
but again we can advocate for these

290
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,680
changes

291
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,080
internally into our organizations right

292
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,839
this again there's going to be calls to

293
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:24,320
action

294
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,240
as the cyber security industry to start

295
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,600
making these changes

296
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,640
because these things have been

297
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,120
problematic for a while just like if

298
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,200
it's an entry-level job

299
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,800
right doesn't need two to three years of

300
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,320
experience because if you list two to

301
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,680
three years of experience

302
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,760
some people aren't going to apply so is

303
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,760
it a junior level job or is it an

304
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,040
entry-level job

305
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,279
and can we write the job requirements

306
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,640
for the for the

307
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,240
minimum things that we need from

308
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,480
candidates because you are preventing

309
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,399
people from applying

310
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,800
when you write these job requirements

311
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,839
there you are

312
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,399
you are alienating a whole set of people

313
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,680
who are not going to apply for these

314
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,240
jobs

315
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,680
and we know this there's been studies

316
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,160
done and what i will tell you

317
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,040
is that women generally will not apply

318
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,560
for these jobs

319
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,320
kirsten renner talked about this in part

320
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,839
of her talk i caught earlier

321
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,480
right women won't apply for a job if

322
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,079
they aren't meeting those requirements

323
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,760
whereas a lot of men will

324
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,560
so you are now inadvertently gatekeeping

325
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,920
the candidate pool

326
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,240
because you wrote the job requirements

327
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,079
way more than what you needed to do

328
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,920
so now most people aren't qualified

329
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,320
for this entry-level role because it's

330
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,160
not written for the entry-level skill

331
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:34,560
set

332
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,720
that you actually needed for the role

333
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,560
this is a problem

334
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,320
this is a problem and it's a problem

335
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,320
around diversity and hiring for these

336
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,560
junior level roles

337
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,600
so i think again we want to advocate to

338
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,680
get this changed and to try to

339
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,920
be more vocal when we are in leadership

340
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,959
positions

341
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,839
for the roles that we're advertising for

342
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:56,640
as a company

343
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,160
let's list the skills that we actually

344
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,079
need and not create these giant

345
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,399
wish lists because people aren't

346
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,519
applying for those roles

347
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,720
and i will say on some jobs

348
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,760
some job specializations probably really

349
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,800
don't have like

350
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,040
what we would consider true entry-level

351
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,720
roles and i'm probably going to get some

352
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,560
people that disagree with this but

353
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,160
you know sometimes it's there are some

354
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,920
specializations where it's really hard

355
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,360
to hire for a for a

356
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,760
pure junior role right out of college

357
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,720
per se

358
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,120
but that entry level role is entry level

359
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,880
but a lot of people are pivoting into it

360
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,240
from other fields

361
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,959
i go to pen testing quite a lot now i've

362
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,279
talked to other people who got

363
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,920
their first job as a pen tester but i

364
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,760
also know a lot more people

365
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,240
who did something else in cyber security

366
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,320
and then became a pen tester

367
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,880
so this is where some mentorship can

368
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,760
help because

369
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,680
a lot of the pen tester roles that are

370
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,279
very junior

371
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,240
might not really be open as your first

372
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,000
job in cyber security

373
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,480
but a lot of applicants aren't getting

374
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,560
advice and and counseling and mentorship

375
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,120
on

376
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,279
on how to get that first pen test role

377
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,639
if that's they want to do

378
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,880
just as one example of a specialization

379
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,560
and there there's other examples where

380
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,160
the role is pretty technical

381
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,320
so even though it's a junior role it

382
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,320
might not actually be an entry-level

383
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,240
role you may have to have another job

384
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,800
first

385
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,720
to get some of those sort of like base

386
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,720
level cyber security skills

387
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,240
and then go into that type of a job

388
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,200
we need to hire entry-level folks that

389
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,160
can do the job

390
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,720
into the entry level roles and stop

391
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,800
writing these job requirements to hire

392
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,399
some person that's actually going to do

393
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,560
the work of six people

394
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,560
i think another big thing is that for

395
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,839
some of these roles at certain

396
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:42,800
organizations

397
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,760
we're not providing sort of paths and

398
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,120
mentorship

399
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,480
for promotions for growth for career

400
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,440
advancement

401
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,680
so in some organizations i think what

402
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,639
you're seeing

403
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,160
is that there's this there's this

404
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,320
turnover in the junior staff

405
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,160
because that organization doesn't have

406
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,560
some sort of established way

407
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,200
for the person to to continue and grow

408
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,160
their career

409
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,079
so then you're in a situation and i just

410
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,440
threw this up here as an example you're

411
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,120
in a situation where you hire a junior

412
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,399
person for the sock

413
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,760
you don't really provide a lot of

414
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,360
mentorship or career paths and

415
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,160
opportunities

416
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,240
so then after two years they leave for a

417
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,320
different type of a job somewhere else

418
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,600
because now they have two years of

419
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
experience so now you just constantly

420
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,240
have this

421
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,320
churn and turnover and you don't

422
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,600
understand why you have churn and

423
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,639
turnover

424
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,320
and it's actually because you haven't

425
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,200
set up the cybersecurity organizations

426
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,160
to give those people pathways to grow

427
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,600
technically and to grow within the

428
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,800
organization

429
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,880
so you just have this constant churn

430
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,440
and and i just want to emphasize when we

431
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,279
are hiring entry level roles that's the

432
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,959
entry into cyber security

433
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,360
so we need to consider that we also want

434
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,040
to help the junior staff that are in

435
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,680
these roles

436
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,920
overcome this imposter syndrome because

437
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,120
even though they finally

438
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,959
get into the industry a lot of these

439
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,160
folks are still

440
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,480
overwhelmed and have this feeling of

441
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,480
inadequacy because there's so much to

442
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,320
know in cyber security

443
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,120
so there has to be some methods to help

444
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,920
those people

445
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,720
once they do join your organization and

446
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,519
it could be

447
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,519
mentoring it could be whatever sort of

448
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,120
like term

449
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,240
you want to have and career guidance and

450
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,800
assistance to help the junior people in

451
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,920
these roles

452
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,760
because that should tie into the fact

453
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,480
that you do have some sort of like

454
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,560
uh you know chart some sort of program

455
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,720
to help the junior people develop

456
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,240
technically and professionally

457
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,639
so that you don't constantly have to

458
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,360
hire

459
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,040
new junior people when they move on to

460
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,519
another organization

461
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,560
and lastly i'm a bit at big advocate of

462
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,480
actively seeking out and hiring

463
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,800
diverse candidates but what i've seen is

464
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,680
the problem

465
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,560
is that people hiring managers right the

466
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,000
hiring manager will say

467
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,760
well we didn't get a lot of diverse

468
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,680
candidates okay well that's a solvable

469
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,240
problem

470
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,399
and that's frankly a cop-out and it's

471
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,079
i'm tired of hearing that

472
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,800
like go to where there are more diverse

473
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,680
people

474
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,839
and hire from these more diverse

475
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,000
organizations

476
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,560
right so i was a federal employee and

477
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,880
usa jobs is not a good mechanism

478
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,440
and there's a lot of reasons for that

479
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,519
but i was very frustrated that there was

480
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,120
no proactivity at

481
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,160
all to try to go get more diverse

482
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,519
candidates to apply

483
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,040
so that we would have more diverse

484
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,959
candidate pools to pick from

485
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,240
at the hiring manager level so

486
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,079
there are things that can be done for

487
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,920
that so if you are in a leadership

488
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,880
position

489
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,199
and you consider yourself to be an ally

490
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,040
for diverse programs and to hire more

491
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,320
diverse people

492
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,360
but you're not like taking steps to go

493
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,880
advertise and recruit at more diverse

494
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,279
locations to get more diverse candidates

495
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,000
aware of the

496
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,639
fact you are hiring then there are

497
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:57,839
things you can be doing

498
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,560
right this is a call to action it is not

499
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,120
just

500
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,639
well these are the candidates that made

501
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,800
it to my desk like i don't think that's

502
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,240
a good enough answer so that's another

503
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,759
call to action if you're in leadership

504
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,480
or management

505
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,920
is you can go find more diverse

506
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,839
candidates you can actively

507
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,880
do that and and not just

508
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,399
you know say well that's who who applied

509
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,839
this is another one for me and maybe

510
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,320
this is controversial but

511
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,759
we hear this all the time is that the

512
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:24,959
hiring managers want to hire someone

513
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,160
who's really passionate

514
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,839
i just saw this about a cyber threat

515
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,519
intel job and it was the weirdest thing

516
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,399
to read

517
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,320
like i still consider myself a threat

518
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,320
intel person i'm not in a threat intel

519
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:34,880
role

520
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,399
but that's my that's my true love in

521
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,480
cyber security and it was like if you're

522
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,800
passionate about analyzing adversaries

523
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,440
and it was like

524
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,519
well like i've worked in intel pretty

525
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,639
much my whole life

526
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,160
and like it's very important and i'm

527
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,920
mission driven i wouldn't i don't know

528
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,600
that i would say i'm passionate

529
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,320
about analyzing the adversary right

530
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,279
that's not

531
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,839
real thing like people don't recommend

532
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,279
operating systems to their friends

533
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,639
unless you're in this world like

534
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,160
would you recommend windows 10 to

535
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,839
someone no i don't talk about operating

536
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:02,639
systems

537
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,640
right passion is not actually a

538
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,119
requirement to do the job

539
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,160
this is gatekeeping i hate this term

540
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,760
passion as i've become more and more

541
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,520
involved in this because

542
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,959
i think people candidates who have

543
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,640
imposter syndrome are like

544
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,199
am i passionate like i like this type of

545
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,119
work i like to do it i would like to get

546
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:23,839
paid for it

547
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,079
but am i passionate right there are

548
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,520
plenty of people who are willing to work

549
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,240
really hard

550
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,160
at their job and do a really good job

551
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,840
but would never say that they're

552
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,400
passionate about the work

553
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,280
i am passionate about soccer passionate

554
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,280
about soccer i love soccer

555
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,120
there are things about my job i like

556
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,559
there are things about my job i don't

557
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,440
like

558
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,400
and i try to do a really good job at

559
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,600
work

560
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,080
for compensation because this is a

561
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,919
capitalist society

562
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,480
so the way we even talk about the jobs

563
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,240
the words that we talk about at

564
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,480
conferences and at hiring fairs

565
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,240
i think is a form of gatekeeping and i'm

566
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,000
not a big fan of the term passion and it

567
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
gets thrown around constantly

568
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,280
so we have to work to get paid

569
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,919
right like i want this job to make money

570
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,720
so i can get groceries and pay my rent

571
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,640
right this is this is such a weird

572
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,480
concept to me that like we only want to

573
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,679
hire people who are passionate about

574
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,720
cyber security

575
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,000
well maybe that's why there's so many

576
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,520
jobs on field because i don't know if

577
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,120
there's 200 000 people who are

578
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,720
passionate about cyber security

579
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,000
just sitting around waiting for the

580
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,360
phone call from the hiring manager to

581
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,720
get them a job

582
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,559
i hope people don't hate their job

583
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,919
because that's crappy

584
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,600
if you're in a really bad position you

585
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,679
hate your job i'm very sorry

586
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,520
reach out to me we will try to find you

587
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,520
a new job like there are recruiters here

588
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,080
there are expo booths go talk to people

589
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,440
please don't stay in a job you

590
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,760
absolutely hate because that's awful

591
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,520
and i'm sorry that you find yourself in

592
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,960
this situation

593
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,559
but most people don't 100 24 7

594
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,679
love their job it's just not true there

595
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,360
are people who really love their team

596
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,720
and they love the organization and

597
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,559
there's aspects of the job they like

598
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,640
but like we all still have been in that

599
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,360
meeting that could have been an email

600
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,799
right so you ought to be successful in

601
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,080
cyber security

602
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,679
you already have to do continual

603
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,120
education continual training and

604
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,640
learning for whatever role you're in

605
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,360
i don't care if it's policy if it's grc

606
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:17,840
if it's

607
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,160
in the dod if it's at a startup if it's

608
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,679
for mobile forensics

609
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,440
like it doesn't matter what you do in

610
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,280
cyber security you're constantly

611
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,000
learning

612
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,880
right and to be good right this already

613
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,720
is a requirement for the job

614
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,280
right this is this is not a job where

615
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,200
you you get your degree and you do some

616
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,480
training once in a while

617
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,320
and then that's good this is not that

618
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,600
kind of a career

619
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,679
so does that mean i'm passionate about

620
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,360
it because i have to do

621
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,200
continual education to stay up to date

622
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,039
on things i don't think so

623
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,039
and this term and the way we talk about

624
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,039
it i think alienates people from getting

625
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,080
into the field

626
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,760
it alienates people from getting to the

627
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,000
field like what about the single parents

628
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,120
who don't have time to 24 7 lab

629
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,840
right i mean that person maybe gets on

630
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,440
infosec twitter and was like geez i

631
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,720
can't do this i

632
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,480
have to take care of my kids or like you

633
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,960
know i have elderly parents or i have

634
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,559
some you know i

635
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,720
you do other things other than cyber

636
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,880
security

637
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,640
so i just wanted to throw this out here

638
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,760
and this is probably fairly

639
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,960
controversial

640
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,360
there are people who are absolutely like

641
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,000
at home

642
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,960
at labs every day doing stuff and we

643
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,559
need those people too

644
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,720
but that's not normally a requirement

645
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,600
that we need

646
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,360
all of the cyber security people at

647
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,120
every organization to have

648
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,520
in order to get the mission done to get

649
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,720
the business working

650
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,679
to secure the systems it's just not and

651
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:40,720
i think that we

652
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,880
aren't discussing this enough and i

653
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,480
think it is another gatekeeping

654
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,559
mechanism the way we talk about you have

655
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,400
to be passionate to be in this field

656
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,240
and it comes up the word passionate is

657
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,760
in a whole bunch of job wrecks

658
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,760
and is in the lingo and you actually

659
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,760
hear hiring managers say i want to find

660
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,840
someone who's passionate about

661
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,880
cyber policy like

662
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,240
okay good good luck that both of those

663
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,159
people probably work at nist already

664
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,240
lack of apprenticeships or paid

665
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,080
internships is another gatekeeping

666
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,200
mechanism

667
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,600
because a lot of the apprenticeships or

668
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,360
i'm sorry a lot of the internships

669
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,400
still that exist are unpaid so if you

670
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,840
are not financially able to take an

671
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,280
unpaid internship

672
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,760
then those organizations that only have

673
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,039
unpaid internships

674
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,600
are gatekeeping certain people out of

675
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,799
the industry

676
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,520
because they cannot literally afford to

677
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,600
take the unpaid internship

678
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,799
so my call to action is let's make sure

679
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,120
we

680
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,440
advocate internally to our orgs if we

681
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,880
have unpaid internships

682
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,360
we make them paid internships and i

683
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,400
don't care if you want to call it

684
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,440
apprenticeship

685
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,720
or paid internship but i hope one day

686
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,880
before i die that we get rid of unpaid

687
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,559
internships because it is super

688
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,559
problematic across the board across all

689
00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,919
industries

690
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,720
so the other thing that a few companies

691
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,559
are starting to do now is having these

692
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,039
upskilling programs and they go by any

693
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,080
number of different

694
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,360
you know industry cool buzzword names to

695
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,559
basically retrain existing good

696
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,919
employees into cyber security roles

697
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,640
okay i think this is fantastic the

698
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,919
company i work with has

699
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,400
has has these sorts of programs going on

700
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,159
i think it's fairly new and

701
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,919
and we don't know how it will work out

702
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,679
fully yet there's a lot of really

703
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,440
complicated factors at play here

704
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,159
uh which we won't get into but i think

705
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,080
organizations of a certain size

706
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,400
of a certain revenue right can have

707
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,640
these programs like if you are unable to

708
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,600
find the staff

709
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,360
externally to fill the cyber security

710
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,440
roles and you have existing staff

711
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,440
and you know they're good employees we

712
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,799
have their you know

713
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,480
yearly um reviews and their

714
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,320
you know their bosses say yeah this is a

715
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,080
good employee let's let them go through

716
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,120
the program

717
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,559
i would love to see more and more of

718
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,840
this in the industry i would love for

719
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,360
this to become the norm

720
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,080
because it is another way to get more

721
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,159
diversity into cyber security as well

722
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,039
because

723
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,520
now we would get a whole bunch of people

724
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,840
from other specializations into cyber

725
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,640
security

726
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,480
and we need those ideas we need that

727
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,799
diversity of thought in cyber security

728
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,720
especially in the organizations i have

729
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,559
been a part of i would love

730
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,080
to see an increase in diversity of

731
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,760
thought when we're trying to solve

732
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,400
difficult problems so i think this is

733
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,840
important let's get rid of unpaid

734
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,640
internships

735
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,880
advocate for paid internships advocate

736
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,559
for these types of programs wherever you

737
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:33,120
work

738
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,200
because i think this is really important

739
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,159
and a key

740
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,720
way we can start to fill some of the

741
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,400
unfilled cyber security

742
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,600
roles this is not

743
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,400
new unfortunately this problem is not

744
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,120
new

745
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,279
and that is why i'm not even close to

746
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,400
being the first

747
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,320
10th or 100th person to probably talk

748
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,600
about this so i found this article from

749
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,240
2017

750
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,480
and it was just it just spoke to me

751
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,559
because so much of the same things

752
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,159
are still happening right now right 2017

753
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,000
how many years ago was that like five at

754
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,279
this point

755
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,440
right we should open ourselves up to

756
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,960
applicants whose non-traditional

757
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,919
backgrounds bring

758
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,440
mean they could bring new ideas to the

759
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,240
position that's it this is so spot on

760
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,080
and this is exactly what we need in

761
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,919
cyber security in a lot of the different

762
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,360
specialties that we have

763
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,200
where there's a lot of open positions

764
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,400
there should be robust

765
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,640
programs for new hires right so when you

766
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,600
have the new hire

767
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,360
like is there some sort of mentorship or

768
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,799
job shadowing or

769
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,799
you know whatever what you want to call

770
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,279
it to get your junior staff

771
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,440
assistance help them conquer this the

772
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,840
fear of inadequacy imposter syndrome

773
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,520
give them ideas about how at that

774
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,279
company they can continue to grow and be

775
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,799
successful and get promoted and stay

776
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,400
with your organization

777
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,919
instead of leaving in two years when

778
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,840
someone offers them 50 more because now

779
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,120
they have two years of experience and

780
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,640
now you just have to hire another junior

781
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,520
person

782
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,919
right some organizations are doing this

783
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,679
but not nearly enough

784
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,440
not nearly enough organizations have

785
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,880
these types of programs

786
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,320
and this continuous learning and

787
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,480
upskilling or retooling of existing

788
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,600
employees

789
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,000
i think we have to advocate internally

790
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,159
to our businesses and our organizations

791
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,679
that they do more of those types of

792
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,279
programs

793
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,600
and also there are some organizations

794
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,440
that really don't let their employees

795
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:17,919
like

796
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,679
there aren't tuition assistance programs

797
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,520
they don't let them take training

798
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,600
and i've been talking to one of my

799
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,200
friends who got a job recently he's

800
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,159
pretty frustrated

801
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,840
with that right now and i think there's

802
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,520
a good chance he doesn't stay there very

803
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,000
long

804
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,039
because they are clearly investing as

805
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,480
little money as possible into training

806
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,080
their cyber security staff and it's

807
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,039
pretty crazy

808
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,799
and i i think it could be one of the

809
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,559
decisions why he ends up not staying

810
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,039
there very long

811
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,960
all right this is helpful it's not

812
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,159
career advice

813
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,840
but there's a bunch of different types

814
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,080
of charts like this to help more junior

815
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,360
staff understand

816
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,039
where they might want to go on their

817
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,799
journey because i think a lot of junior

818
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,320
people feel lost

819
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,640
even once they get their first job they

820
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,679
don't know

821
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:00,960
all the different career paths that they

822
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,400
can have in cyber security and they're

823
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,000
not getting a lot of mentorship

824
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,200
they're they're not getting a lot of

825
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,279
professional development

826
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,559
at the place that they work at

827
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,960
so this is pretty good i like this chart

828
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,559
to some extent

829
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,720
there's another chart here which i think

830
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,400
is also very helpful

831
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
because ideally we want you to find your

832
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,520
niche we want

833
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,520
i want you to all work somewhere where

834
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,360
you enjoy working most of the time

835
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,200
right again we don't all love our jobs

836
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,400
24 7. i

837
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,760
i've never met someone that loves their

838
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,840
job 24 7. so if you're out there

839
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,559
i'm gonna have to look at chat right but

840
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,400
it took me a long time to like find

841
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,520
threat intel

842
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,039
as an example like it took me a long

843
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,720
time to be like oh this is

844
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,640
this is where i fit and there's some

845
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,080
other related things

846
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,320
along there that i enjoy doing as well i

847
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,000
really enjoy being an instructor for

848
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,679
example

849
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,520
but a lot of people don't understand how

850
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,039
many different things there are that you

851
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,159
can specialize in

852
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,840
so like when you hire that brand new

853
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,840
person you know whether they're brand

854
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,200
new out of college or like brand new

855
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,279
from another career field whether they

856
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,960
you know reskilled or like you know

857
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,039
proactively change careers

858
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,679
right it may take them some time to to

859
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:08,320
find

860
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,000
their niche in cyber security because

861
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,880
there's so many different

862
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,080
specializations

863
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,919
and areas but i really hope that as

864
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,120
people who are part of mentoring

865
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,120
programs like i'm a mentor with women in

866
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,000
cyber security

867
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,200
i think there's a lot of really good

868
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,360
programs out there i we

869
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,679
you want to like expose the more junior

870
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,760
folks to to these types of charts

871
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,440
to help them really think about like

872
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,440
where where do i want to work where's my

873
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,240
best fit

874
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,760
for the skills i bring to the table

875
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,360
technical and non-technical skills

876
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,039
the other place and a lot of people have

877
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,880
talked about this recently i love the

878
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,360
nice cyber security framework

879
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,640
i think it is very helpful some of it is

880
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,159
very dod centric

881
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,960
so again pros and cons with everything

882
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,960
but if you are new to this or trying to

883
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,039
help mentor people

884
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,039
this framework has at least the last

885
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,640
time i checked up i think 52

886
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,760
specializations

887
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,240
at least like 48 of which are applicable

888
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,840
to basically anywhere

889
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,039
i mean i don't think there's too many

890
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,360
commercial places doing hopefully active

891
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,640
cyber operations

892
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,039
but outside of that this is a very good

893
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,880
framework and it has all the knowledge

894
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,399
skills and abilities

895
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,240
for all the different positions so you

896
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,320
don't have to do any of that work

897
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,240
and some organizations are starting to

898
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,960
align their like job families

899
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,919
and job postings with some of the

900
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,360
knowledge skills and abilities with

901
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,799
these roles so like it

902
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,200
so it all makes sense because in a lot

903
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,720
of organizations

904
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,720
there there's not a comprehensive

905
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,720
organization on the back end

906
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,640
of sort of how all those positions are

907
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,159
aligned to

908
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,200
at an organization so if you're at an

909
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,720
organization that's struggling with this

910
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,080
is a really good resource

911
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,080
or if you're a junior and want to know

912
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,120
like the different types of

913
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,640
specializations there are this is a

914
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,880
fantastic resource

915
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,480
andy piazza's talk which was a

916
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,159
pre-conference talk for the diana

917
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:56,799
initiative

918
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,720
he talks about using this framework

919
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,640
specifically to look at the knowledge

920
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,840
skills and abilities

921
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,840
to help you make your own individual

922
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,080
training plan and that's exactly like i

923
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,279
loved his talk

924
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,799
um and it's not just because he's a

925
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,559
former army person too it was really

926
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:11,279
helpful

927
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,600
because i think a lot of people maybe

928
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,600
look at you know a chart like this

929
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,360
and say oh i want to go into this

930
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,679
specialization like but how do i

931
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,520
how do i navigate my career to get to

932
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,960
this other thing that i really want to

933
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,440
do

934
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,760
well if that other thing is in here then

935
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,200
you can look at the knowledge skills and

936
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,080
abilities

937
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,080
sort of make your own personalized

938
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,360
training chart

939
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,279
of things you ought to study and become

940
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,080
better at in order to then apply for

941
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,640
for a for the job that you really really

942
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,200
want to do

943
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,440
at some point hopefully that makes sense

944
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,640
also i couldn't probably script my way

945
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,480
out of a paper bag

946
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,120
i am not a coder i am not a programmer

947
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,399
thank god for google

948
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,799
i was able to pass my one programming

949
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:55,520
class

950
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,200
you know to get my associate's degree

951
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,720
that took five years to get

952
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,279
it's just not my thing i i thought i was

953
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,120
going to be a pen tester i decided i

954
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,080
like mohawks

955
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,960
pen testing not for me i'm not a

956
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,000
programmer i'm not

957
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,399
a reverse engineer that's not my role

958
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,399
but i've managed to find my niche in

959
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:13,679
cyber security

960
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,679
around cyber threat intelligence i was

961
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,120
an instructor for a while

962
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,000
i can do policy and and i understand a

963
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,919
lot of the technical things that are

964
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,360
going to be discussed

965
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,039
but you do not want me configuring a

966
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,640
firewall that is not my role

967
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,240
like it i will it will be bad probably

968
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,279
there is a whole thing here from

969
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,919
jb from john brett about less technical

970
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:36,720
roles

971
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,640
right so there are some less technical

972
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,399
roles in here but there's other sources

973
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,000
of information about you want to be in

974
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,120
cyber security

975
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,360
but like i'm not good at programming i'm

976
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,120
not good at scripting like what else can

977
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,559
i do

978
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:49,840
i just talked about this the other day

979
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,159
somewhere cyber

980
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,799
lawyers like that's the thing i think

981
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,640
i've met all three of them

982
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,840
right because there's a lot of people

983
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,760
know about cyber and then there are some

984
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,159
lawyers and there are very few cyber

985
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,200
lawyers

986
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,679
and they are needed pretty much anywhere

987
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,360
like really large organizations need

988
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:07,840
them

989
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,600
the federal government state governments

990
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,519
like people who understand cyber

991
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,480
security

992
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,799
and law that is like a thing you can

993
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,080
specialize in

994
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,120
um right like ui ux

995
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,720
um there's all sorts of roles available

996
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,519
that are what i would just call sort of

997
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,320
lesser

998
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,720
less technical some of these might be

999
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,519
less hands-on

1000
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,440
it all depends i'm a cyber threat intel

1001
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,519
person but but i always describe that

1002
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,200
there's a range of cyber threat intel

1003
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:35,840
people

1004
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,919
right i consider myself a less technical

1005
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,600
cyber threat intel person

1006
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,600
and there were much more technical cyber

1007
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,880
threat intel people

1008
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,399
i was really good at presenting and

1009
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,080
writing reports and research

1010
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,679
and there were other people who were you

1011
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,200
know helping to automate

1012
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,279
some of the the ways we looked up

1013
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,200
technical information and metadata

1014
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,039
right and i was not going to do that

1015
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,200
part and maybe they weren't as good at

1016
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,880
writing the reports but we were

1017
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,559
we were both integral into the

1018
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,559
organization

1019
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,120
so if you are interested in this between

1020
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,559
the nice framework

1021
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,360
some of these charts and maybe some

1022
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,279
posts like this

1023
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,640
there is a place for you in cyber

1024
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,120
security and we need you

1025
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,159
all right this slide there's so much

1026
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,880
emphasis on like these crazy job posts

1027
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,720
that are basically a team's

1028
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,519
worth of work to do because apparently

1029
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,799
the hiring managers want to hire all

1030
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,080
these unicorns

1031
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,559
or rock stars you know what i've had the

1032
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,240
opportunity to work with a couple people

1033
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,760
that i would probably consider

1034
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,480
some of the best technical people ever

1035
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,360
and

1036
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,679
they have sometimes a rock star

1037
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:40,960
mentality

1038
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,120
and sometimes the rockstar doesn't mesh

1039
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,039
with the rest of the band

1040
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,000
so you know i'm not a big fan of those

1041
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,720
terms

1042
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,320
because there are some amazing technical

1043
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,679
people that are also really great at

1044
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:52,960
teams as well

1045
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,360
but these people who are normal

1046
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,159
employees

1047
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,640
that bring to the table the skill set

1048
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,720
needed to do the job

1049
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,640
they are doing more work than all the

1050
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,159
unfilled positions you have at your

1051
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,519
organization

1052
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,399
right and i bring this up because as a

1053
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,960
person who manages a lot of people

1054
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,399
right i expect this to be where most of

1055
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:15,360
the people

1056
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,760
in my organization are i expect them to

1057
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,600
be adequately doing the job that we ask

1058
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,320
them to do

1059
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,600
and you're going to have a lot of high

1060
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,120
end performers maybe if like you're a

1061
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,559
really good organization

1062
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,480
most organizations have a few high-end

1063
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,080
performers and you're probably going to

1064
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,679
have some performers on the other side

1065
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:30,640
of the scale that you're sort of

1066
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,000
mentoring more and trying to get them up

1067
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,880
to speed

1068
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,279
this is just the reality of the world

1069
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,039
everybody is not a top performer

1070
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,519
everybody is not a non-performer the

1071
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,760
vast majority of people in the workforce

1072
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,880
are perfectly adequate normal employees

1073
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,519
and that's really at the end of the day

1074
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:48,880
who we ought to expect

1075
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,519
to hire into most of our roles much less

1076
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,120
whether it's an entry level or

1077
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,760
a mid-roll and i don't think this gets

1078
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,200
talked about enough either

1079
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,000
so i think reaching for someone who's

1080
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,320
like

1081
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,600
amazing right that's not always like

1082
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,080
gonna

1083
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,080
be very realistic either especially

1084
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,000
based on like the salary you might be

1085
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,679
offering as an organization

1086
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,320
right because the people who are up here

1087
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,760
are in demand

1088
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,560
and maybe you can't afford them anyway

1089
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,040
so

1090
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,839
hire the people who have the skills to

1091
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:20,480
do the

1092
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,560
job that you need them to do and if you

1093
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,480
don't know what those skills are

1094
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,000
then you need to go back to the drawing

1095
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,199
board and take a look at that and

1096
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,320
rewrite the job right

1097
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,000
and probably talk to the people who are

1098
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,399
doing the job on a daily basis

1099
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,800
so i didn't just want to talk about the

1100
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,760
problems

1101
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,760
i wanted to talk about things that we

1102
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,679
can take to our leadership to our

1103
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,480
management

1104
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,679
to speak at at conferences to to help

1105
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,599
start solving the problem

1106
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,719
that we have because i have only been in

1107
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,839
cyber security for

1108
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,079
about 11 and a half years and this is

1109
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,000
already very tiring because it has

1110
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,520
existed for at least the whole time i've

1111
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,040
been in cyber security

1112
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,720
so i will continue to try to fight the

1113
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,240
good fight but but

1114
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,560
we are all the cyber security industry

1115
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,640
right so the more we speak out about

1116
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,040
this

1117
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,119
whether we're technical or non-technical

1118
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,400
or if you're here as a recruiter if

1119
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,920
you're here as a vp

1120
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,079
i don't care what you're here as we are

1121
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,720
the cyber security community these are

1122
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,599
solvable problems these are solvable

1123
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,280
problems

1124
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,079
so we can offer to help with hiring

1125
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,760
managers and recruiters

1126
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,800
i have spoken at multiple times at large

1127
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,440
sort of like brown bag events to explain

1128
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,200
cyber security to like all of the

1129
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,119
recruiters at an organization

1130
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,480
all of the recruiters didn't even

1131
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,400
recruit cyber but they all really

1132
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,359
appreciate sort of

1133
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,280
understanding like how complex and

1134
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,400
diverse it is

1135
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,079
right they didn't know there was so many

1136
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,240
different types of specializations

1137
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,079
right because they they don't recruit

1138
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,920
for those types of roles but they got a

1139
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,320
better

1140
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,400
understanding of like how complicated it

1141
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,320
is to hire the right fit

1142
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,040
for certain cyber security roles

1143
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,640
internally referring qualified

1144
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,359
candidates

1145
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,440
i try to do this and be proactive about

1146
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,800
this all the time

1147
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,240
i don't think we're talking about this

1148
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,560
enough so if you are here

1149
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,119
today and you work in this field there

1150
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,599
is probably a way for you to internally

1151
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:12,079
refer

1152
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,880
qualified candidates uh at the

1153
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,480
organization or the company you work

1154
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:16,880
with

1155
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,200
and i think that can also help bypass

1156
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,160
like the ats

1157
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,359
and some of the other gatekeeping

1158
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,240
mechanisms so i would argue that we

1159
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,079
should be doing that more and more

1160
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,680
i think the more that we can volunteer

1161
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,520
at colleges career villages hiring

1162
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,560
events conferences

1163
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,560
talk about these types of things help

1164
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,000
people update their resume

1165
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,839
help ensure that their resume gets in

1166
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,599
front of hiring managers

1167
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,079
that that's an actual action we can take

1168
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,079
and we don't need to do this 24 7

1169
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,079
but you as an individual if this is a

1170
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,920
problem you see and you have ideas and

1171
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,040
you want to help and

1172
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,040
get more diverse candidates jobs and get

1173
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,480
more diverse candidates in front of the

1174
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,280
hiring board

1175
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,200
and get more diverse candidates on on

1176
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,240
the you know in executive roles as well

1177
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,960
these are some things that we can do i

1178
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,000
think

1179
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,839
at this point in my career i'm pretty

1180
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,359
comfortable raising

1181
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,560
uh my voice up when i see a problem all

1182
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,000
of us probably aren't in positions where

1183
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,280
we feel comfortable doing

1184
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,920
that yet and and i know some of us here

1185
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,000
probably are very comfortable doing that

1186
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,560
but the more as an industry we speak up

1187
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,880
about the issues the job requirements

1188
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,720
the not under not enough diverse

1189
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,000
candidates in the poll

1190
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,520
the fact that we're not actively

1191
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,599
recruiting where we would get more

1192
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,359
diverse candidates

1193
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,839
i think we can start to drive change the

1194
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,440
paid internships

1195
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,440
upskilling programs apprentice style

1196
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,599
curriculum at our organizations

1197
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,200
these are things we can influence maybe

1198
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,960
it's something that you can bring up

1199
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,200
that you might institute if your

1200
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,960
organization your business doesn't have

1201
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,000
these things

1202
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,680
right and obviously the smaller the

1203
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,040
business maybe there's there's less

1204
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,160
resources for this

1205
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,920
but a lot of us work at some very large

1206
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,839
companies and if you're here today there

1207
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,440
are also some very large companies who

1208
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,960
have sponsored us and we thank them for

1209
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,280
that

1210
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,119
and their recruiters are here and maybe

1211
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,480
you're listening to me

1212
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,200
but how do we get these jobs filled well

1213
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,960
if we have employees that are interested

1214
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,760
in cyber

1215
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,440
maybe we let them retrain into some of

1216
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,520
these cyber security roles

1217
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,760
the bottom line is that this has not

1218
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,800
changed in

1219
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,680
many years and i think unless we start

1220
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,880
to take action

1221
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,880
and more people talk about this and take

1222
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,320
this seriously and drive

1223
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,960
change we'll be here in five more years

1224
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,040
talking about these same things

1225
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,800
and to me that's a very depressing

1226
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,040
thought i want to help drive the change

1227
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,880
i want to have career affairs and career

1228
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,880
villages where we start to solve these

1229
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,440
problems

1230
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,400
and and get over over these hurdles when

1231
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,839
it comes to hiring

1232
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,839
all candidates especially bringing more

1233
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,359
diverse voices and more diverse

1234
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,160
candidates

1235
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,040
into cyber security because i know that

1236
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,240
we need you

1237
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,800
we need you in this role and i want to

1238
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,480
help as much as i can and i will

1239
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,320
i will continue to speak out and do what

1240
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,920
i can but i urge

1241
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,000
all of us to try to take action even if

1242
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,760
it's a small action

1243
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,680
right you can all take a small action

1244
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,760
and that will all add up over time

1245
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,920
so that hopefully i'm not giving this in

1246
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,119
like 20

1247
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:07,359
26 or whatever that would be then

1248
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,440
so there are some references in here i

1249
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,880
can make the slides available

1250
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,440
i don't have them up on a on a

1251
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,079
repository

1252
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,520
at the moment but i will now sort of see

1253
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,480
if there's any

1254
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,200
other discussions or chat or questions

1255
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,280
that i can try to answer

1256
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,359
before we have our final keynote of the

1257
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,040
conference

1258
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,320
that's my twitter handle if you want to

1259
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,320

1262
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,000
and i can't see the chat yet so i will

1263
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,920
bring up stage one

1264
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,079
on another tab so i could see if any of

1265
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:57,839
you have questions

1266
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,839
and i can't see the chat yet so i will

1267
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,760
bring up stage one

1268
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,920
on another tab so i can see if any of

1269
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,720
you have questions

1270
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:21,359
i'm just trying to see yeah some people

1271
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:25,839
say they do have paid internships

1272
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,599
introductory tutorials

1273
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,880
seriously angela zim cyber lawyers

1274
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,560
there's there's a need for this there's

1275
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,920
a need for cyber lawyers

1276
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:50,880
i will share the link to these slides

1277
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,960
and then the slides will have

1278
00:40:52,960 --> 00:41:06,000
all the material

1279
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,680
all right hopefully this link will work

1280
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,240
don't apply for amazon

1281
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,440
so a lot of people have given the talk

1282
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,960
about knowledge skills and assessments

1283
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,000
andy piazza gave a pre-conference talk

1284
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,760
so we were trying to drive up hype for

1285
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,680
the conference

1286
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,440
i will find that for you it is on the

1287
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,839
diane initiative youtube page

1288
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,640
all right i changed i changed the uh

1289
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,400
google drive

1290
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,800
um so hopefully the google drive works

1291
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,599
to get my slides

1292
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,440
and i know we have the closing coming up

1293
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,839
soon

1294
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,480
red flags in terms of jobs kayla is that

1295
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:31,839
what you meant

1296
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,839
somebody asked about red flags

1297
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,240
i think if that's what you meant in

1298
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,480
terms of red flag for jobs

1299
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,839
we talked about this at the career

1300
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,520
village a little bit

1301
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,000
it's a two-way interview street right so

1302
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,680
you should be asking some questions as

1303
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,000
well

1304
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,280
if you're interviewing at an

1305
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,480
organization um

1306
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,200
so there can be some questions you ask

1307
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,800
at the interview to try and get some

1308
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,160
information especially if the job

1309
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:08,880
description

1310
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,599
is terrible one of the things for that

1311
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:12,960
is could you tell me

1312
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,440
on a day-to-day or a weekly basis what

1313
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,200
my primary responsibilities are going to

1314
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,440
be and what teams i'm going to work with

1315
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,040
and if they don't have a very good or

1316
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,560
concrete answer for that

1317
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,640
that's a red flag right off the bat in

1318
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,560
terms of going back to the job

1319
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,319
description potentially being like super

1320
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:29,359
broad

1321
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,880
um yeah so that's something you can also

1322
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,000
talk about like

1323
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,920
how do you guys measure success in terms

1324
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,760
of like performance and promotions at

1325
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,960
this organization

1326
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,520
you can ask about that you can phrase

1327
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,720
that in a way that you're comfortable

1328
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,480
with asking but i would definitely ask

1329
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,040
about

1330
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,480
what's a measure of success how is

1331
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,240
success measured do you have performance

1332
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,119
reviews

1333
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,720
you know what are the criteria to get

1334
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,800
promoted or their career paths here

1335
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,319
you can definitely ask that at the

1336
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:57,119
interview as well

1337
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,599
all right so the google drive links work

1338
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,200
i'm on twitter i'm on linkedin i'm

1339
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,319
pretty easy to find

1340
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,480
i am not to john stoner from splunk

1341
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,079
that's a different person who i finally

1342
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,680
connected with and i'm super excited

1343
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,040
because we've been mistaken for each

1344
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:15,680
other

1345
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,359
um so if you find that john stoner at

1346
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:18,960
splunk that's a different person

1347
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,480
i'm the jon stoner at booze allen

1348
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,000
hamilton and i

1349
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,880
will answer as many requests for

1350
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,000
information as i can

1351
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,119
if you find me on linkedin or

1352
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,599
wherever

1353
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:51,839
any final questions

1354
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,400
all right i know we have the keynote and

1355
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,800
i think possibly some sort of social

1356
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,280
so i'm not seeing any other questions

1357
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,880
you guys can get a hold of me if there's

1358
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,640
some other questions but i'm probably

1359
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,040
gonna

1360
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,480
call it a day there and hopefully

1361
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,480
we're all hyped for the final closing

1362
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,240
keynote i think the conference has been

1363
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,000
fantastic once again thanks to all the

1364
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:12,800
sponsors

1365
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,000
we couldn't do this without all the

1366
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,640
sponsors we also couldn't do without all

1367
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,240
of the volunteers it takes a

1368
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,000
it takes a village to run the diana

1369
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,680
initiative it takes so many people on

1370
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,480
the back end

1371
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,680
to make this work um so um

1372
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,839

1374

1375
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,440

1376
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,599

1379
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,920
