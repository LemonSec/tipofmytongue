CISO Panel

2
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,630
TRACY: Hello, and thank you for joining us
today for this panel of esteemed chief information

3
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:34,910
security officers in this session. Managing
things and leading people in information security.

4
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:41,480
Comes from a quote from the late Grace Hopper
where she simply, but eloquently said, you

5
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,919
manage things. You lead people.
We are here today to talk about what it takes

6
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,230
to lead in good times and in bad times. As
well as getting insight from our panel on

7
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:58,239
how you can develop into a leader as well.
To illustrate the point of leadership, I will

8
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,910
be using quotes about this topic as a way
for us to engage with this discussion. Let

9
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:10,090
me first begin by introducing our esteemed
panel of CISOs and leaders. First we have

10
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:15,090
Ann S. Johnson, corporate Vice President of
security, compliance and identity business

11
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,390
development at Microsoft. Hello, Ann.
ANN: Hi, thanks for having me.

12
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:27,290
TRACY: We are expecting to have Wendy Nather.
Head of advisory, chief information security

13
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:34,320
officers at Cisco. Hopefully she will be joining
us. Next we have Rinki Sethi, Vice President

14
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,669
and chief information security officer at
Twitter. Hi, Rinki.

15
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:43,670
RINKI: Hi, Tracy, hi, everyone.
TRACY: And batting clean-up for us is Lena

16
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,390
Smart, chief information security officer
at Mondo DB.

17
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:53,250
LENA: Hi there.
TRACY: Hello, Lena. I'm your moderator, Tracy

18
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:59,271
Maleeff, I'm a security researcher at the
Krebs Stamos Group. Why don't we dig in? We

19
00:01:59,271 --> 00:02:04,780
have a lot of great questions and discussion
we can have. Let's start with the first question.

20
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:14,760
John Maxwell says: A leader is one who knows
the way, goes the way, and shows the way.

21
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:21,230
In the information security industry and community,
a common trope is that of the quote, unquote,

22
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:27,730
non technical CISO. Now, has that gone the
way of the Dodo bird? A CISO who hasn't worked

23
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:33,629
their way up through the technical ranks?
Are there viable pros and cons to having a

24
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:42,120
technical versus a non technical CISO? First
question to Ann. Would you like to field that?

25
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:49,260
ANN: Yeah. I think that when you think about
CISOs, they come from a lot of different backgrounds.

26
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:56,280
And I think there's there's benefit to understanding
the technology. But the most important thing

27
00:02:56,281 --> 00:03:01,140
is understanding how the technology maps to
an organization's business needs. Because

28
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:06,659
at the end of the day, security needs to be
an enabler for business, not an inhibitor.

29
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:10,929
And working side by side with the business
peers, understanding their objectives, make

30
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:16,800
sure you maintain regulatory compliance and
privacy and those type was things is equally

31
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,520
important to the technical aptitude. But you
do need to understand the technology at a

32
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:27,170
high level. But it the extent that it maps
to the business needs, right? I don't think

33
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:31,440
that I still meet a tremendous amount of CISOs
around the globe that come from all different

34
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,090
backgrounds. Some are deeply technical, business
and policy side. They're all equally effect.

35
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:44,580
I don't think there's a one size fits all.
But the CISOs need to communicate effectively

36
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,950
with their business peers.
TRACY: That's a great answer, Ann. Sending

37
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:56,079
this over to Lena. Lena, you work for Mondo
DB, talk about your thoughts with a technical

38
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,470
versus non technical CISO.
LENA: Most of the CISOs I have met worked

39
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:08,689
their way up. I think what Ann says resonates
deeply. It's great if you're super technical

40
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:13,859
and you know crypto and you can decrypt 50,000
lines of code and see the bad there. But if

41
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,300
you can't talk to the board and can't talk
to your team and can't manage, you know, what's

42
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:26,770
that really worth? I don't think it's going
the way of the Dodo bird. But I do think that

43
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:32,520
we're seeing I'm definitely seeing more CISOs
who have got that kind of hybrid, the technical

44
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,299
up to a point. They can earn the respect of
their peers and their team. But they can also

45
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,510
dazzle the board. And they have enough business
acumen to get the job done and communicate

46
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:46,500
clearly as to what they want done and why
they need budget.

47
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,279
TRACY: Wonderful, thank you. You know, I realized
we never agreed upon a correct pronunciation

48
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:59,860
of CISO. You're going to hear different pronunciations.
Rinki, bring us home?

49
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:09,460
RINKI: I like my peers here, described it
perfectly. But I do think it depends on the

50
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,969
company and it depends on the role. And the
CISO role still has so many definitions to

51
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:19,710
it. Many times a startup company, you'll see
a CISO as one person and they're expected

52
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:25,409
to be highly technical. They're architecting
solutions. They're deeply embedded with engineering.

53
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:29,419
And you look at larger companies or banks
where the CISO is more risk focused, has to

54
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:35,460
understand the business. And so, you see kind
of a range of CISOs out there. I do think

55
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:40,880
the most important thing technical or non
technical, and I think both make really good

56
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,669
CISOs, is that the ability to learn quickly,
understand the business needs, as Ann said.

57
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:51,090
And then be able to translate like very I
mean, some of the biggest challenges we deal

58
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:56,649
with are in the information security space.
And to then take these complex issues, translate

59
00:05:56,649 --> 00:06:02,650
them into business requirements and have your,
you know, all the stakeholders in the company

60
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:08,580
understand risk at a level that they're then
able to make really good decisions to accelerate

61
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,000
the business. And I think that's what it's
all about at the end of the day.

62
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,710
TRACY: Fantastic. All great answers. Remember
a couple years ago everybody was up in arms

63
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:23,620
that there was a music major who was a CISO
for Experian, I can't wait for a couple years,

64
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:33,450
that a library science like myself is in charge.
Those are great answers. Moving on to question

65
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:42,070
two, according to Publilius Syrus, anyone
can hold the helm when the sea is calm. Within

66
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:49,349
the boundaries of what you're permitted to
discuss, can you speak to a time or time when

67
00:06:49,349 --> 00:06:54,750
is you were in charge when something went
terribly wrong? What leadership tactics did

68
00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:01,700
you employ? How do you best manage and organize
the human factor, the people, while in the

69
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:07,440
white hot heat of a security incident? And
this might be unfair, but I'm sorry, Rinki.

70
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,709
I'm going to go to you first. Since some if
you're allowed to.

71
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:16,120
RINKI: Yeah. I mean, as soon as you say that,
so many incidents pop up in my head. And like

72
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,570
my heart starts beating really fast and I
remember how I felt. And I remember the first

73
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:28,010
thing I've done is taken a deep breath to
really like calm down my heart rate. Because

74
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:33,649
the last thing you want to do as a leader
is start running with your head cut off and,

75
00:07:33,649 --> 00:07:37,760
you know, freaking everybody out. It's all
about maintaining calm, understanding the

76
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:43,030
facts, what's going on. Being able to communicate
with the executive and executive team. And

77
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:47,250
then setting boundaries. So, the team can
go and investigate, contain. And so, I think

78
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:51,339
those are the most important things is staying
calm. Ensuring, prior to an incident, that

79
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:56,090
you've had hopefully have a crisis management
plan in place so you have the buy in that

80
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:01,659
you need. And then I remember working on an
incident in one of my prior companies that

81
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:08,089
lasted, gosh, I think it was very heated for
almost 3 or 4 weeks. And teams were working

82
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:12,590
around the clock.
And, you know, at that point, I don't know

83
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:17,810
what that I was wearing, whether it was a
mom hat. Taking orders for food. Whatever

84
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:22,900
the team needed. But I was in there with them,
in the room every single day. Any time there

85
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:28,450
was a body in there, I was there with them.
And I think showing that in the deep care

86
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:33,909
that you have for the team, taking care of
them. Make sure that they have what they need.

87
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:38,169
And that their mental state is good. Because
their they, you know, incident responders,

88
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:42,110
they're in the trenches. And they want to
do everything to make sure that the company

89
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:46,390
comes out of this in a good position. And
they will not sleep or eat or do anything

90
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:51,279
that they need to do. And so, I think watching
out for them in that way is very, very important

91
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:57,350
as well. So, yeah. Staying calm, taking care
of the team. Keeping your executives updated.

92
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:02,220
But making sure that the team is able to then
go and do their work in a healthy way.

93
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,930
TRACY: And I'm not sure if this is a fair
question or not. But I'm just curious, because

94
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:13,680
it's Twitter, do you feel extra pressure when
there's an incident? Or does it feel any more

95
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,329
I don't know if you can compare it to a past
experience. And not that any company's not

96
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:22,090
significant. But I'm just curious, because
it's Twitter, does that feel even more crushing?

97
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:30,740
RINKI: Hey, Wendy! Glad you were able to make
it. Yeah, I think at Twitter one of the things

98
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:36,160
is that an incident is the one big difference
I've seen, and I'll talk about a few nuances.

99
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,610
But the one big difference I've seen is that
when there's an incident, there's a lot more

100
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:44,390
people involved. Because the incidents, they're
not just they're never just a security incident.

101
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:49,080
There's so much more to it. And everything
that happens on Twitter is talked about on

102
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:54,260
Twitter. And so, it's already public generally.
There's that aspect of it. You're caring for

103
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,900
a larger group of people. You're managing
a larger group of people. That's lot more

104
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:03,420
noise. The chaos you see on Twitter is a lot
of times internally at Twitter as well. That's

105
00:10:03,421 --> 00:10:12,350
how we operate. It's a lot harder to manage.
COVID made it easier for teams to collaborate

106
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:19,731
and have a level playing field, but made it
harder to check in with folks. Or if I need

107
00:10:19,731 --> 00:10:23,420
information if folks are in a war room and
they're in the heat of it. You can't walk

108
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:30,550
up to them, you're waiting to respond to Slack
messages. Checking in is much bigger of an

109
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:34,979
effort because you have to go spend time with
the individual. You are not observing your

110
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:40,960
team and how they might be feeling or doing.
That made it a lot harder. I don't think that's

111
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,501
Twitter specific. I just happened to move
to Twitter during the COVID situation. Those

112
00:10:45,501 --> 00:10:47,920
are kind of the nuances that I've observed
here.

113
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,020
TRACY: Sure. Thank you familiar perspective.
That's great. Ann, is there anything you're

114
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:58,380
able to share with the question?
ANN: What I will share is the RSA breach.

115
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:05,741
Which was 10 years ago. I was there. Here's
what I would say. And Rinki said it. Have

116
00:11:05,741 --> 00:11:12,090
a plan. Have a breach recovery plan that you've
tested, you've communicated. Everyone knows

117
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:18,970
what the plan is. Stay calm. Work the plan.
Rely on your instincts. Check in with the

118
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:25,110
team. Keep the executives up to date. And
as Rinki said, when you're doing an event,

119
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:30,350
it's more than just technical, right? You
have legal concerns. You have public relations

120
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:34,920
concerns. You have board concerns. You may
have regulatory concerns. All of that needs

121
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,881
to be in the plan. So, when you do hit this
crisis, you're not in crisis mode. You're

122
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:41,900
just working the plan that you've already
developed and tested. But the most important

123
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:46,420
thing you can do as a leader is show confidence.
Even if you have to fake it, right? Show confidence.

124
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:51,530
Be calm. Be there leading from the front for
your team. And just follow your instincts

125
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:57,449
you've got this. You know the plan. You're
a hyper intelligent person who has worked

126
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:02,960
through these types of things. And you have
to trust that you can lead your team through

127
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:10,770
this event even if you're I say, schedule
my breakdown for when this is over. Put that

128
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:14,710
on the schedule for later. We just need to
get through this right now. That's what I

129
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,600
would say.
TRACY: Wonderful. Thank you. And Lena, why

130
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:26,810
don't you bring this home for Q2 and any bright
spotlights you have been under and at the

131
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:30,050
helm?
LENA: I can't talk about specific incidents.

132
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:35,359
But what I try to think of, I'm the captain
of the plane that's 30,000 feet above the

133
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,980
Atlantic Ocean and the engines have just cut.
And you just have to be, as everyone has said,

134
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:46,510
just remain as calm as possible. When we do
tabletop exercises, we make it clear that

135
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:51,471
it's a safe space. You can shout and scream
and vent and blame people all you like. As

136
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:56,090
long as at the end of it we work out, this
is your role. This is what will happen if

137
00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:01,570
the inevitable hits the fan. And they've got
it kind of out of their system, hopefully.

138
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:06,760
We have gone through the worst thing that
can possibly happen. So, hopefully, when something

139
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,580
does hit the fan, it's not that bad and you
know how to deal with it. There's a playbook

140
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:14,870
for it. Look here, that's where you'll find
what to do next.

141
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:19,920
TRACY: Fantastic. And I would like to give
a welcome to Wendy Nather. Hi.

142
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:29,160
WENDY: Thanks, everybody. I'm that CISO who
shows up late to meetings and apologizes and

143
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,930
dashes out in the middle of the meeting because
there's something else on fire.

144
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:38,250
TRACY: Wonderful. You're just in time for
question three. I'm going to have you take

145
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:44,460
that first. Let me read it for everyone. Question
three, staying with the idea of things going

146
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:51,850
wrong, Maile Carnegie said the only real negative
that can happen when you fail is that haven't

147
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:58,290
learnt from it. Can you share examples of
lessons that you have learned along the way

148
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:02,689
in your career progression and how has that
shaped you as a leader?

149
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:13,150
WENDY: Oh, boy. I'm going to argue with this
saying right here. Depending on what environment

150
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:19,430
you're in, if you're an underrepresented person,
people are waiting for you fail. And they

151
00:14:19,431 --> 00:14:26,820
are waiting for you, to point it out. And
unfortunately, we have part of the culture

152
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:32,990
of InfoSec as an industry is there are people
who specialize in going, ooo... you missed

153
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:40,130
a spot. How could you let that happen? I can't
believe you didn't XYZ. And those are usually

154
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:45,500
the people who have never sat in this seat
and don't understand how these sorts of things

155
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,430
happen. So, there are lots of negatives that
can happen when you fail.

156
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:56,599
I find that the biggest failures that I regret
the most and have tried to learn from the

157
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:03,460
most were in handling people. Sure, there
are lots of technical mistakes that you can

158
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:09,130
make. There are things that you don't have
in place. Or you chose to prioritize things

159
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:13,250
in the wrong order and everything. But when
you're dealing with somebody's life and their

160
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:19,000
livelihood, I find that that is just, you
know, the most important thing as a leader.

161
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:27,550
So, I try, as I get older, not to sweat the
technical stuff. And to some extent the political

162
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:34,050
stuff. But I do care very much about my people.
And I keep trying to learn how to do better

163
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:38,329
in, you know, being a good co worker and supporter
to them.

164
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,880
TRACY: That's a great answer. Thank you. And
yes, all of our panelists, please feel free

165
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:50,150
to dispute the quote. Too. It was just meant
as a discussion point. So, let's go over to

166
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:55,209
Rinki. Rinki, what have you learned? What's
some things you have learned about being in

167
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:59,380
a leadership role?
RINKI: Oh, my gosh. I'm learning all the time.

168
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:04,560
And failing all the time and learning from
my mistakes. The one that sticks out to me

169
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,819
that was a really early lesson, but I'm glad
that it happened, was when I was at eBay.

170
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:14,370
And this was a long time back. But it was
at a time where spear fishing was at a rise

171
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:23,560
and eBay was seeing kind of the first early
attacks around spearfishing in the E retail

172
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,979
space. They wanted to be really bold and try
something new called phishing testing. Which

173
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:34,839
is a very regular thing. But back then, it
was unheard of. Banks were doing it, that

174
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:40,890
was about it. So, it was early for the e commerce
site. I ran a small pilot with maybe about,

175
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:46,630
gosh, 10 people from the security team. I
informed many people we were going to do this

176
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:54,020
pilot. It wasn't anything offensive. But someone
was having a bad day, clicked on the link.

177
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:59,340
Got a training message that, hey, this was
a phishing link. This is what you shouldn't

178
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:05,279
do. And what you should be aware of. They
reported it to the head of HR. And one of

179
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:10,740
eBay's values at the time was assume people
are basically good or something like that.

180
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,939
And I got lectured that if you ever do this
again, you will be fired. You will not have

181
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:21,049
a job at this company. This was unacceptable.
This was assuming that people aren't good,

182
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:25,770
or people don't know what they're doing.
And so, my lesson learned there, I've rolled

183
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:30,650
out phishing testing again and again after
that. But my big lesson learned was as a security

184
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:36,030
person, you have to communicate really, really
well. Let people know what's going on. I also

185
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:40,331
learned on the phishing testing front that
people might be having a bad day and you have

186
00:17:40,331 --> 00:17:45,270
to make the messages kind of fun. You have
to warn people this is coming. You can't just

187
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:50,530
have it come out in secret. That communication
learning for me is something that stuck with

188
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:55,930
me. I've leaned on the side of overcommunicating.
And actually that skill is very useful as

189
00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:02,220
a CISO. We're constantly communicating and
educating. And along the way, I think that

190
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,179
was the biggest one that always stuck with
me. Have I communicated with everybody that

191
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:10,570
needs to know? It's a huge lesson learned.
But something that still sticks with me today.

192
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:14,591
TRACY: That is an incredible lesson learned.
Thank you for sharing that with us. Let's

193
00:18:14,591 --> 00:18:20,510
do over to Lena. Lena, what's something that
you learned? How did it shape you as a leader?

194
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:26,920
LENA: So, I quite enjoyed this question. Although
I did get really bad flashbacks to what had

195
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:37,130
happened. So, many years ago I got thrown
out of the guides, it's like scouts for girls.

196
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:42,520
TRACY: Girl scouts, yeah.
LENA: The reward of getting thrown out of

197
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:47,040
them for fighting. But that's totally for
another day. But they did teach me to be prepared.

198
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:52,780
That was one of the things. Was be prepared.
And so, obviously, I didn't learn very much

199
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:59,750
from that. There was very early in my career,
maybe 20 or 21. I was asked to do a presentation

200
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,860
to a customer. What is a computer? This is
when people were just replacing typewriters

201
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:08,120
with computers. And I just thought I knew
everything. I thought I was the big I am.

202
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:15,659
I had a computer at home I saved up for 4
year to buy. I was an expert. I wasn't. So,

203
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,790
I didn't even bother to prepare anything.
Oh, I'll just go and talk to these people.

204
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:23,270
And the majority of the time, they were glad
to be at the office, getting free food and

205
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:28,590
a cup of tea. But there was one guy who thought
he knew everything, and he proceeded to make

206
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:35,270
my life miserable for the longest 60 minutes
of my life. And then he wrote a horrible letter

207
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:40,220
to my boss saying she doesn't know anything.
We're not paying for this, this was awful.

208
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:45,050
The cake and the tea was lovely. But she was
terrible. And my boss took me into a room.

209
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:50,629
I was just crying, almost hysterical at this
point. He didn't fire me. I wasn't going to

210
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:54,490
get fired from it.
But it seared into my brain. I can feel the

211
00:19:54,490 --> 00:20:01,940
shame of that day. Looking back, it was a
tiny thing. I was 21, I thought I knew everything.

212
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:08,110
I was his top performer, and I got my legs
shot from under me that day. Now I'm super

213
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:16,309
prepared. I've got like 5 pages of notes just
for this just so I can answer every question

214
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:22,920
12 different ways. Because it's also respectful,
you know? But that was just a huge that was

215
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:27,180
a huge learning curve for me was like, you
don't know everything, and you do actually

216
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:31,370
have to put time into this if you want to
be taken seriously. That was my response.

217
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:36,739
TRACY: Oh, wow. I would like to add a note
to the Diana Initiative organizers to please

218
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:42,049
book Lena as keynote next year, getting kicked
out of the Girl Guides.

219
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:48,600
LENA: I probably should have gone to prison
for it. Nobody died.

220
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:57,540
TRACY: I think there's something about being
a Scottish CISO. There's lessons to be learned.

221
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:04,000
LENA: I can tell you a lot of stories when
I worked in a shipyard.

222
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,100
TRACY: You need to keynote, and we can talk
with you. Ann, what youth groups did you almost

223
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:14,169
get kicked out of?
ANN: You know, my mother wouldn't let me join

224
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:23,590
the Girl Scouts, but that's a whole 'nother
story. Here's something that I carry with

225
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:28,929
me today, that's why I'm going to go back.
My mind is always racing and there's always

226
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:34,070
something going on. At times, I have difficulty
staying present. To Lena's point, that's a

227
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:41,270
sign of respect. You're meeting with people,
you need to be engaged and actively participating

228
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:45,320
and not just checking the box that you did
it. And I remember the first time this happened

229
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:51,220
to me. I was in my early 20s also and I had
a customer meeting. And they had I was living

230
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:56,170
in Southern California in the foothills, and
they had announced there was a fire. And that

231
00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:00,500
was in, you know, in the foothills. And I
didn't know, you know, back then we didn't

232
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,340
have social media. I couldn't go there was
no instantaneously checking, right? I'm listening

233
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:08,899
to the radio as I'm driving to this meeting
thinking, okay, my dogs are home. My partner

234
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:15,170
is pretty far away. I'm closer.
But I still went to the meeting, but my mind

235
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:19,260
I wasn't there, right? I wasn't mentally there.
How long is it gonna take me to get home?

236
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:25,920
Make sure the dogs are okay. This fire is
close. To Lena's point, the woman I met with,

237
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:33,140
this buyer, look, I don't know what this woman
was doing, she told my boss. She wasn't here.

238
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:41,191
It was one of the worst meetings of my life.
In reality, I should have canceled the meeting

239
00:22:41,191 --> 00:22:45,161
or rescheduled it. It was a situation where
I wasn't going to be present. But it's also

240
00:22:45,161 --> 00:22:50,429
something I still have to remember today to
give what I'm doing the full time and attention.

241
00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:56,970
My team will joke. They'll say the joke is
squirrel, we lost her. A squirrel flew by

242
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:03,310
the window, and I really try to minimize those
moments because it's disrespectful to other

243
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:08,220
people to not be present when they're spending
a lot of time and effort, right? To prepare

244
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:13,299
for a meeting and you're just mentally not
there. So, it's something that I continually

245
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:16,070
learn.
TRACY: That's a really great point that I

246
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:22,210
wasn't even expecting to come out of this
answer. So, thank you, Lena and Ann for that.

247
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:26,270
That's really great. All right. For those
of you playing the home game, we're moving

248
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:31,389
on to question four.
So, question four. Too many people have been

249
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:36,790
attributed to the statement about talking
to the C Suite. That statement that goes,

250
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:42,320
be brief, be bold and be gone. You may have
heard it as be brief, be brilliant and be

251
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:49,760
gone. As CISOs, can you explain from your
point of view how you wish people communicated

252
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:56,100
with you? Or share some strategies of how
to best make an impact and be heard up the

253
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:01,320
chain of command? What guidance or advice
would you give folks trying to communicate

254
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:06,379
to skip levels? And why don't we kick that
off with Wendy?

255
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:13,870
WENDY: I was gonna suggest, you know, like
hand puppets. Or, you know, anything that

256
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:23,620
gets peoples' attention. Yeah. I think the
best thing that has worked for me is and it

257
00:24:23,621 --> 00:24:30,080
sounds cliche but really trying to find out
in advance what it is they want to know. And

258
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,949
especially if it comes down to risk discussions.
I find that the biggest gap between the CISO

259
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:43,480
and the C Suite is the agreement on how probable
a given risk is for happening. They might

260
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:48,559
say, yes, you're right. The impact, we agree
on, you know, if this happens, we'll lose

261
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:55,020
$11 billion in Federal funding. But we don't
think that's gonna happen. So, trying to have

262
00:24:55,020 --> 00:25:03,070
that discussion with them about how, you know,
how likely do you think it is? And walking

263
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:08,931
through it with them in their language, you
know, if they give you the answer, they're

264
00:25:08,931 --> 00:25:13,810
more likely to believe in it than if you give
them the answer. So, I find that, you know,

265
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:19,770
the top level of the fair model, for example,
is great for just throwing up one slide and

266
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:23,629
going, okay. Let's talk this through.
How many Mitnicks do you think it would take

267
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:32,240
to break into this? You think five, I think
two. Okay. Let's do this. So, it really is

268
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:39,420
important to be able to give them the information
that they want. Not necessarily the things

269
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:44,950
that are interesting to you. And you always
have to remember that you are just a very

270
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:50,260
small part of the things that they're concerned
with all the time. Whether it's right or it's

271
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:56,179
wrong. You know, security is not the main
thing in their life. You know? If you are

272
00:25:56,179 --> 00:26:00,020
a fire fighter and you're running around putting
out fires all day, you feel line the whole

273
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:06,910
world is on fire. The rest of the people,
not so much. So, that's that's all the wisdom

274
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:12,640
I have for this, really. Other than hand puppets.
TRACY: Well, that alone is worth the price

275
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:18,370
of admission. So, yes, thank you. Ann, why
don't you talk to us about some communication

276
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:23,631
strategies. How do people at Microsoft communicate
with upper levels? Or if you don't want to

277
00:26:23,632 --> 00:26:27,130
use that as an example.
ANN: I can use that as an example. The most

278
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:31,500
important thing is know your audience. Every
company culture is different and every person

279
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:36,470
you're communicating with is actually different.
And at Microsoft, you know, it may shock you,

280
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:41,530
that as the creators of Excel, we can find
a data point for everything. So, Microsoft

281
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:46,928
is extremely data driven. That's not a pejorative
statement. It is what it is. So, depend on

282
00:26:46,929 --> 00:26:51,530
who at Microsoft you're meeting with, you
might need to go with the dense deck of data

283
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:57,770
to deliver your point. However, I'm a big
believer in be brief, be brilliant and be

284
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:02,309
gone. Just so you know. And no matter who
you're communicating with, don't bury the

285
00:27:02,309 --> 00:27:10,250
lede. You need to story tell. Even if you're
going to have a lot of data. What story is

286
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:14,830
that data telling you? I always say, what
are the three things you want the audience

287
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:19,760
to leave the meeting with? Three things. And
that's what I say to my team. Whether it's

288
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,850
a written document, a PowerPoint or an oral
presentation, what are the three things you

289
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:28,190
want the audience to leave with? And you need
to know that yourself, by the way. Sometimes

290
00:27:28,191 --> 00:27:33,201
we get so deep in the data, or like Wendy
said, firefighting, that we forget. We're

291
00:27:33,201 --> 00:27:38,140
not focusing on what's important. So, if you
can focus on three things. Start every conversation

292
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:42,070
with that in mind. If it's a really data driven
organization, make sure your data supports

293
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:47,740
those three things and then get those outcomes.
That's how I drive every meeting at every

294
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:52,590
level. It helps an executive, super busy,
focused on a million things. If they know

295
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:57,709
exactly what your expects are coming out of
the meeting. Here's what I want to get from

296
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:04,929
this meeting. As I said, don't bury the lede,
start there. I typically start a meeting,

297
00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:09,700
this is because I did spend a lot of years
in sales, as many of you know. Here are the

298
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:14,310
objectives of the meeting. Are you aligned
to these objectives? Let's start there. And

299
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:17,100
then that sets the table. And it doesn't matter
who you're meeting it.

300
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:21,270
it's a really effective strategy.
TRACY: That's fantastic. So, just kind of

301
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:27,460
in summary, I guess you're also kind of talking
about that bluff, b l u f, bottom line upfront,

302
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:33,980
or the inverted pyramid for the audience,
stacking the details up front.

303
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:38,470
ANN: Anything who knows me, if you're not
going to walk into a room that way, you're

304
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:44,190
not going to have a long meeting either. That's
how you communicate with me. Some people have

305
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,580
more patience. But it is a bottom lines up
front.

306
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:55,210
TRACY: And to borrow the idea of hand puppets,
I think Clippy should be running the meetings.

307
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:58,750
See what you can do.
ANN: The Chippy emoji is back.

308
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:03,200
TRACY: I know! I'm excited.
ANN: 20,000 likes. We got over a couple hundred

309
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,640
thousand. The emoji is back at least. We love
Clippy.

310
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:20,590
TRACY: I love Clippy. And to the birds, the
Twitter bird is named Larry after Larry Byrd.

311
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:26,480
But I digress, Rinki, what can you talk about
communication and how you like to be pitched

312
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,809
with or how people can better communicate
with upper levels?

313
00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:38,240
RINKI: Yeah, you know, when I think about
this, I folks, the time is just so limited.

314
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:44,309
And I think the quicker I love conversations
where they're very direct. And folks come

315
00:29:44,309 --> 00:29:48,960
clear with what their ask up front. Here's
what I need from the meeting. That's what

316
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:57,380
Wendy and Ann alluded to. And especially a
lot of times as a CISO, you hear about problems

317
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:02,750
and issues the company. And I want I want
people to come not just with the problem,

318
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:07,480
but a proposed solution and what we can do
about it. And so, I think those are really

319
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:12,450
important things. I also get, you know, and
I'm sure everybody here, we get pinged about

320
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:18,170
mentorship or coaching. And people will just
come and say, hey, I want to I want to have

321
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:21,840
a conversation with these skip level. I want
you to be my mentor. But then there's no details

322
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:27,280
on what they're looking for from a mentor,
how they want to be mentored, how they want

323
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:32,240
to be coached, what training they're looking
for. I think being direct, coming in with

324
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,970
a clearer ask. Here's the problems I'm dealing
with, here's how I think I'm going to solve

325
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:43,679
them. Do you have advice? Whether it's a security
issue, whether it's a mentoring thing, I think

326
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,700
those are really important things. Just because
otherwise it's a lot of times you sit in a

327
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:52,860
meeting and 20, 30 minutes later, you're still
wondering what that meeting was about.

328
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:58,780
TRACY: So, you brought up something that is
a really good point and I'm gonna pivot off

329
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:06,790
it for a second. So, if you have someone who
is maybe perhaps on the spectrum. Because

330
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:11,860
you said about being direct. Do you have any
tips or does anyone on the panel have any

331
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:16,918
tips for folks in that situation who, you
know, they want to be direct, but they also

332
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:21,750
don't they don't to want to come off as rude?
Like are there any skills you can put into

333
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:26,830
place that to make sure that you're being
direct, but not rude? Do you understand what

334
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:31,960
I'm asking? Honestly, that probably can go
for everybody. You know whether or not if

335
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:37,110
you're of your brain type. But I'm just curious,
since Rinki brought up being direct. Does

336
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:42,870
anybody have any thoughts on that?
ANN: I'm going take it from somebody taking

337
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:47,709
the meeting, not necessarily from somebody
in the meeting. One thing I try to do is take

338
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:53,710
people off the defensive as much as possible.
So, I don't sit behind my desk. I sit with

339
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:58,809
them at the conference table, next to them.
And those types of things. And I think that

340
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:03,090
when especially when you have folks who maybe
are on the spectrum, right? Who are super

341
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:06,559
talented folks? But you want them to feel
like they can communicate with them, you need

342
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,530
to do everything you can to make the environment
as comfortable as possible and to be as open

343
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:16,520
as possible. And that's when you truly have
to, you know, make sure you are listening,

344
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:20,530
and you are understanding. And you also need
to make sure your head isn't in the space

345
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:26,668
of, everyone needs to show up to you the same
way, right? Because we talk about bringing

346
00:32:26,669 --> 00:32:32,380
your authentic or whole self to work. As a
leader you need to respect that. But I try

347
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:37,850
to create an environment where people are
not intimidated. I try to do that in interviews

348
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:42,559
and meet people where they're at. And we have
better dialogues.

349
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:49,720
TRACY: Thank you, John Budgick, neurodivergent
wasn't one of the words I was thinking of

350
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:57,390
on the fly. That's what I was trying to get
to, thank you, John. And Charlotte Blackmer

351
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:07,059
is sometimes read from women is direct is
read as rude. I wanted to share her comment

352
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:14,370
there.
WENDY: If I could make a comment. I'm neurodivergent

353
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:20,610
myself and I have lots of family and loved
ones who are neurodivergent. I want to make

354
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:30,379
sure people who are understand that it's not
necessarily a case that people who are neurodivergent

355
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:37,120
can accidently say something rude and not
know that they're being rude. People they

356
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:44,168
can tell when people are upset. You know?
They they can't necessarily backtrack and

357
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:48,940
reverse engineer why they're upset. But they
can tell that something landed badly. They're

358
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:55,170
not sure why. And so, it's always helpful
if you're neurodivergent yourself to say,

359
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:59,550
you know, this is important for me to say.
And I'm I'm hoping I'm gonna say it the right

360
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:05,320
way. And, you know, go ahead and say that
out. But just be a little more explicit about,

361
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:12,659
was that a joke that you just made? Or, you
know, let me see if I understand this, you

362
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:18,928
know, were you serious when you said this?
And there is nothing wrong, as a neurotypical

363
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:24,310
person, by being that explicit and that verbose
and asking, you know, I just want to make

364
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:26,489
sure I understand whether this was a joke
or not.

365
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:31,750
TRACY: Got it. Thank you. Thank you for explaining
that. I apologize I couldn't think that have

366
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:36,010
correct term. But everybody got what I was
I was getting at. Because I felt like we definitely

367
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:43,069
should mention that. And Lena, I didn't forget
about you. So, I was gonna preface this by

368
00:34:43,069 --> 00:34:49,788
saying, I don't know if people realize this.
But the Scot's have a very direct way of speaking.

369
00:34:49,789 --> 00:34:55,039
I think that's an understatement, maybe? One
of my favorite Scottish expressions is you'll

370
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:59,020
have had your tea. So, if you invite someone
over to your house, meaning you'll have your

371
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:07,519
tea, don't come expecting food or drink.
LENA: Don't try to mooch off me.

372
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:15,750
TRACY: Exactly. Given you're different, considering
this panel perspective on communication, can

373
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:22,420
you share with us, you know, what what some
tips are for communication and directness

374
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:26,039
and things like that?
LENA: It's funny you mention the Scottish

375
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:31,829
thing. We are kind of we are blunt. It gets
to the point, and you get more time to have

376
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:39,060
fun. So, some of the some of the feedback
I got since I moved to America was, be aware

377
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:43,109
that the person, especially for step down,
be aware that the person is absolutely terrified

378
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:50,779
to talk to you. They've never met a C Suite
in their life. And the conversation will likely

379
00:35:50,779 --> 00:35:54,941
be the topic of their discussion with their
family and friends for a while to come. Even

380
00:35:54,941 --> 00:36:00,950
if it's the most bland, boring discussion
that you've had for that day. I've found that

381
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:05,799
I have to be very careful with my words. Everything
I say is going to be pulled apart and interpreted

382
00:36:05,799 --> 00:36:12,339
in a myriad ways. And I'm sure we've all done
this, kind of off the cuff, it would be nice

383
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:18,180
to see a chart that did blah di blah. 7 minutes
later the chart is there, and they dropped

384
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:22,819
everything else. And the boss is asking why
did you ask them to do this chart? I didn't.

385
00:36:22,819 --> 00:36:29,670
I thought it was a good idea. That's one thing
I've learned. Be really careful with my words.

386
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:35,930
And in terms of communicating up, I like to
be concise, honest and present. I'm sure we've

387
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:40,990
all been in meetings where you know somebody
is making stuff up and it's embarrassing.

388
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:49,078
And you just want to say, just shush. It's
like done a fash, just stop. So, sometimes

389
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:54,819
I just say things in Scottish. They're like,
okay. That sounds like I should shut up. Yeah.

390
00:36:54,819 --> 00:37:00,650
Just be honest. If you don't know the answer,
just say, I'll get back to you. And then you

391
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:04,790
get back to them. Because we can tell in a
heartbeat if you're making stuff up. We have

392
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:10,180
the BS meters running at high.
WENDY: I love that. And what we should make

393
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:16,160
sure that everyone remembers is that people
whose native language are not English are

394
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:25,229
going to come across as blunter because their
vocabulary isn't quite as extensive. So, yeah.

395
00:37:25,229 --> 00:37:31,089
Especially with my German buddies. If they're
if we're exchanging email in English, it's

396
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:35,359
going to come across as really blunt. But
if you talk with them in person and just kind

397
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:41,461
of hang out for a while, you realize that
it's a speaking style that comes from, you

398
00:37:41,461 --> 00:37:47,390
know, dealing with a second language. And
we all have to respect the heck out of that.

399
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:51,828
TRACY: Absolutely. Fantastic point. Thank
you, Wendy, for mentioning that. And I apologize,

400
00:37:51,829 --> 00:37:57,700
Rinki, did I get to you for this question?
We did, right? Okay. Sorry. I have my little

401
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:03,230
system and it's already falling the wheels
are coming off. Trying to multitask here.

402
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:10,329
Let's move on to question five here. Question
five. Rosalynn Carter, the wife of former

403
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:16,150
President Jimmy Carter says a leader takes
people where they want to go. A great leader

404
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:22,529
takes people where they don't necessarily
want to go, but ought to be. So, let's talk

405
00:38:22,529 --> 00:38:28,509
for a few minutes about exerting influence,
setting good examples and being role models

406
00:38:28,509 --> 00:38:34,219
as CISOs. What techniques do you employ for
getting your human assets to be on board with

407
00:38:34,219 --> 00:38:40,130
a security program? Or even their own professional
development? Now, whether it's convincing

408
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:46,799
a fellow C Suite member or frontline end user,
panel, what thoughts or examples of persuasion

409
00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:52,859
do you utilize to get the message of security
across? And I want to go to Lena because I'm

410
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:58,239
hoping there's a headbutt involved.
LENA: Yes, also known as a Glasgow kiss.

411
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:02,630
TRACY: Exactly.
LENA: Yeah. I always find that honesty is

412
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:08,849
best. I'm not very good at lying. I would
be a terrible poker player. My face goes bright

413
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:14,289
red. Also telling people the possible outcome
it is they don't do something can be very

414
00:39:14,289 --> 00:39:19,799
powerful, you know? And there has to be a
personal responsibility and accountability

415
00:39:19,799 --> 00:39:25,450
are also very important to me. And I know
it's trite, but you have to lead by example.

416
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:29,140
If you're underhand and always trying to stab
people in the back and people know that about

417
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:37,740
you, you're not gonna last very long. To Wendy's
point, even if you're blunt, people will just

418
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:42,819
listen to you. Or maybe they're just terrified
of me, I really don't know.

419
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:48,200
TRACY: Got it. Rinki, I want to go to you.
Because as you already know, one of my former

420
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:53,989
coworkers told me how much she looks up to
you, admires you. The exact quote is immaterial

421
00:39:53,989 --> 00:40:02,559
to be Rinki Sethi from I grow up. Since you
have that fan base, how do you feel about,

422
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:07,809
you know, being a role model and what, you
know, what actions do you take for leadership?

423
00:40:07,809 --> 00:40:13,230
RINKI: Yeah. I had to take that screenshot
and then text it to my daughter to be like,

424
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:21,079
see? Someone thinks I'm cool. Because she
definitely doesn't. No. You know, leader I

425
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:27,529
feel like leadership is more of an art than
a science. And it's all about people, understanding

426
00:40:27,529 --> 00:40:33,279
people. Every person is different. And one
of the things that I've learned is and I've

427
00:40:33,279 --> 00:40:37,869
learned from many of the women that are on
this panel, actually is you have to bring

428
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:43,119
your whole self and your authentic self. And
that includes sharing with people your vulnerabilities.

429
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:49,829
Sharing with people who you are. And we saw
Wendy just do that a few minutes ago. And

430
00:40:49,829 --> 00:40:53,920
it makes people open up to you. And when you
have that personal connection. It's hard to

431
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:59,079
influence or set strategy and get people on
board if they don't trust you.

432
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:04,709
And so, trust is everything. And especially
for a role in security. And I can tell you

433
00:41:04,709 --> 00:41:09,250
that I've made the mistake of going into a
company, setting a strategy really quickly,

434
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:13,329
feeling the pressure that I've got this 90
day plan and I've got to go and just get it

435
00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:17,920
done. And I didn't take the time to build
the relationships that I needed to, to understand

436
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,849
the folks on the team. Understand my peers.
Understand the leadership. What was important

437
00:41:22,849 --> 00:41:26,869
to them. Because I was so focused on I've
got to get this in 60 days I've got to have

438
00:41:26,869 --> 00:41:32,509
the strategy done. And by 90 days, I've got
to be executing on it. And the execution wasn't

439
00:41:32,509 --> 00:41:37,710
going as planned. And it made me realize,
I got to slow down to really be effective

440
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:43,380
and then be able to move fast. And so, I I
think it's really important to that at the

441
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:47,150
end of the day, it's just a human connection.
Influence is all about building the right

442
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:51,559
relationships. You know, I also think it's
really important to bring data to the and

443
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:56,579
facts to the table when you don't have those
relationships built yet so that you can start

444
00:41:56,579 --> 00:42:00,549
then bringing things to the table that are
not based on opinion. You know, not based

445
00:42:00,549 --> 00:42:04,489
on anything other than what is the actual
truth, which is data. So, I think those things

446
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:10,969
have proven, in my opinion, to be very effective
ways to gain trust to build to build kind

447
00:42:10,969 --> 00:42:14,710
of a following and then to be able to execute
to build the right partnerships.

448
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:19,910
TRACY: Fantastic. And we're happy to all sign
a card to your daughter to let her know how

449
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:24,808
much we all think of you and how highly we
think of you.

450
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:31,920
Ann, other than enticing people with screen
time with your cute puppies, how do you how

451
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:37,529
do you expert influence? Whether it's to get
a buy in for security or just helping a mentee

452
00:42:37,529 --> 00:42:41,670
with professional, how do you see yourself
for question five?

453
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:47,799
ANN: People know if you genuinely care. People
can tell instantly if you genuinely care.

454
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:54,190
If you're being honest. I tend to be honest,
a little bit too blunt at times. But I do

455
00:42:54,190 --> 00:43:01,260
genuinely care. I genuinely care about our
security program and the people. I'm going

456
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:07,339
take this to a people aspect for a moment.
Because part of the quote that's really important

457
00:43:07,339 --> 00:43:12,500
is getting people where they don't necessarily
want to go, but they ought to be. When you're

458
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:17,709
thinking about career development with people,
about half the people I've worked with actually

459
00:43:17,709 --> 00:43:21,359
have a pretty defined plan. I want to do this,
this and this. And half are like, I'm not

460
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:26,220
sure what I want to do. And having those deep
conversations and staying connected with the

461
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:30,430
people and being really thoughtful. And some
of the hardest conversations I have had with

462
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:35,149
people, look, this role isn't the best fit
for your skills, aptitude or background. Or

463
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:43,200
your desires. And you're not enjoying it.
Let's talk about where you should be. What

464
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,058
can the company you're a talented person,
you bring a lot to the table. Where can you

465
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:51,859
and the company find a good match where you're
going to be fulfilled and having a lot of

466
00:43:51,859 --> 00:43:56,299
impact for the company? Those are really hard
conversations to have. You have to be comfortable

467
00:43:56,299 --> 00:44:01,280
having them. You have to do it from a place
of genuine caring for the individual. And

468
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,670
as Rinki said, you have to establish trust.
They have to trust you and know you'll have

469
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:11,460
that conversation with them. They're in a
safe space and they can talk about what's

470
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:16,519
really on their mind. And to me, that's how
you actually get people to where they ought

471
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:22,129
to be. You actually listen, you engage, you
invest the time. And it's not a one off conversation.

472
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:26,309
All of us, I think on this panel do a lot
of mentoring. There's a lot of those conversations

473
00:44:26,309 --> 00:44:30,380
that are long term conversations until you
finally get people into a great place for

474
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:34,599
them and they're feeling fulfilled. When people
are fulfilled, they're going to do their best

475
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:37,911
work.
TRACY: Fantastic answer. Thank you, Ann. Down

476
00:44:37,911 --> 00:44:42,570
there deep in the heart of Texas, Wendy, how
do you light a fire under people?

477
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:49,440
WENDY: Well, I'm gonna counter with a quote
from my dad. Who used to say, "There they

478
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:55,769
go. I must hurry and catch up with them. For
I am their leader."

479
00:44:55,769 --> 00:45:01,689
That's often how I feel. That, you know, sometimes
I'm not leading, I'm helping to support from

480
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:13,160
behind. I don't necessarily know where we're
going either. And I feel uncomfortable sometimes

481
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:19,729
these days with presuming that I know what's
best for somebody. And so, you know, as everybody

482
00:45:19,729 --> 00:45:26,730
else has been talking about, it's really important
to find out what the person themselves wants.

483
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:32,789
They might say, I'm happy in this position.
I don't need to advance. That's totally a

484
00:45:32,789 --> 00:45:39,360
thing. So, it's it's finding out what they
really do want. But having said that, some

485
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:45,579
of the best managers that I've had have told
me a couple things. They've explained to me

486
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:50,630
what was going on at their level so that I
could understand. And secondly, they would

487
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:58,350
tell me what skills or experience I was missing.
And they made sure that I could get it. Like

488
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:03,509
they would say, you haven't managed any budgets
yet. I'm gonna put you on, you know, to do

489
00:46:03,509 --> 00:46:09,010
this. So, they made sure that I learned things.
But what I did with it after that was up to

490
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:13,880
me.
So, I'm lucky, extremely lucky to work with

491
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:19,640
very senior, very smart people. And a lot
of times I'll say, I don't know what we should

492
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:26,740
do here. What do you think? And so, sometimes
we all take turns leading. And I'm really

493
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:32,939
just there, you know, to sing backup for anybody
who needs it. That just kind of is my position.

494
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:42,479
TRACY: Oh, wow. It would be such an honor
to have you as a pip in the background. One

495
00:46:42,479 --> 00:46:48,140
of the exactly. Wonderful. Let's move on to
question six. Which is kind of a an interesting

496
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:53,019
question. But let's see where this goes. So,
question number six is, renowned coach of

497
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:59,339
the Green Bay Packers football team, Vince
Lombardi, famously said: Leaders aren't born:

498
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:09,328
They are made. So, panel. What made you into
a leader? Are there classes? Books? Experiences?

499
00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:15,339
Philosophies? Any of that shaped and formed
how you see leadership and execute it? So,

500
00:47:15,339 --> 00:47:21,450
let's let's kind of get in real deep with
Rinki. What is there anything that you follow

501
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:25,939
or that guides you that you feel made you
into a leader?

502
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:33,890
RINKI: I you know, it's interesting. Because
I have read a lot of leadership books to learn.

503
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:40,490
And just get inspired. But what's actually
taught me the most are other leaders. I've

504
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:47,269
watched really good leaders or just people
that I've heard from afar or seen from afar

505
00:47:47,269 --> 00:47:52,538
where I'm like, I want to be like her when
I grow up. Or people and then the opposite

506
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:56,650
too. Where you work for really bad leaders
or you see really bad leadership traits and

507
00:47:56,650 --> 00:48:01,499
you're like, I'm never gonna do that. And
I need to make sure, like what makes someone

508
00:48:01,499 --> 00:48:07,468
behave that way? Because I need to learn what
it is so that I never do that. And those are

509
00:48:07,469 --> 00:48:12,519
the things that I think have shaped me. I
try to follow the good. And that I think or

510
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:17,799
at least what I feel is good and try not to
follow what I think is bad. And I also rely

511
00:48:17,799 --> 00:48:23,020
I constantly ask for feedback. Even today,
I don't think I'm perfect in any way, shape

512
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:27,329
or form. I have a lot more to learn. I will
ask for feedback from my peers, employees,

513
00:48:27,329 --> 00:48:37,109
leaders. What am I doing more? That I am not
aware of? What can I do better? And I try

514
00:48:37,109 --> 00:48:43,619
to form relationships, hey, Rinki, that was
off. Probably don't want to do that again.

515
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:50,400
Or whatever it is. Yeah, that's how I've learned
and shaped and continue to learn and shape.

516
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:56,739
Every now and then I look for books or videos
or things that I can get inspired by to like

517
00:48:56,739 --> 00:49:03,200
refresh. And so, I think that's really important
too. I get inspired constantly on Twitter

518
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:08,249
itself, actually. Where I've found a whole
new InfoSec family. So, I think that's been

519
00:49:08,249 --> 00:49:13,348
amazing as well.
TRACY: Fantastic. Wendy, do you have any philosophies

520
00:49:13,349 --> 00:49:20,249
that you follow? Other than the sage wisdom
of your father? As far as, you know, leadership

521
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:25,729
goes? It's just yeah, hand puppets.
WENDY: It's all hand puppets. Well, I was

522
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:31,468
gonna say, yeah. Leaders are totally yeah.
Leaders are made. In fact, my first promotion

523
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:36,619
to a managerial position was a surprise to
me. I didn't know about it until they had

524
00:49:36,619 --> 00:49:42,989
an All Hands meeting, and they put it up on
a screen on an org chart. And I had to turn

525
00:49:42,989 --> 00:49:51,219
to my colleagues and go, I'm sorry, I didn't
know. And I had no you know, I had very hands

526
00:49:51,219 --> 00:49:56,829
off management. I had no mentorship. I had
to figure it out myself from that time forward.

527
00:49:56,829 --> 00:50:03,720
Yes, I've made a lot of mistakes and had to
learn from them. I love the idea of learning

528
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:08,149
from other people's examples, both positive
and negative. But I think the other thing

529
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:14,999
that has helped me a lot. And some of probably
just getting older. It's when I've gotten

530
00:50:14,999 --> 00:50:20,328
to the point where I feel confident in saying,
I don't care if this is the culture or if

531
00:50:20,329 --> 00:50:25,670
this is how the top leaders do it. This is
wrong. And I'm not gonna do this. And I'm

532
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:31,410
not going to settle for it.
And I don't know how to, you know, how to

533
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:37,779
encourage other people to get to that point
as well. To trust yourself and say, you know,

534
00:50:37,779 --> 00:50:44,319
this culture is just wrong. And, you know,
I'm not going to go along with it. I'm not

535
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:50,390
going to emulate it even though this is how
it's done. I would love to hear from everybody

536
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:55,269
else on the panel how you share that with
somebody else.

537
00:50:55,269 --> 00:51:01,930
TRACY: Yeah, Lena, do you want to comment
on Wendy's question and the question in general?

538
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:06,848
LENA: I think the philosophy that changed
me was being told no. I wasn't gonna amount

539
00:51:06,849 --> 00:51:12,999
to anything. When I was 16, I didn't have
a degree. You know, I had been working since

540
00:51:12,999 --> 00:51:19,640
I was 14. I had to, you know lots of things
happened. And, you know, I used to be told

541
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:27,209
you'll be a typist. You know, just type. You'll
be fine at that. And I thought, stuff you!

542
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:32,038
And so, this is horrible. And I'm not really
a spiteful person. But I do sometimes go on

543
00:51:32,039 --> 00:51:36,160
to like Facebook and just see the people that
said I would come to nothing are still living

544
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:40,999
in the same place and doing the same stuff.
And sometimes I'm tempted to go, ha. But I

545
00:51:40,999 --> 00:51:46,578
don't.
WENDY: I was a typist too. So, yay! Typists

546
00:51:46,579 --> 00:51:50,519
represent.
LENA: Learning how to touch type probably

547
00:51:50,519 --> 00:51:54,390
really helped in this job. Because you can
type, and you can talk, and you can do five

548
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:57,440
different things and it just freaks people
out. Yep.

549
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:07,359
TRACY: Oh, yeah. Who was whose mic is on that
is talking? That it's not that's not me. So,

550
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:11,489
let's just try to plow through. I don't know
where that sound is coming from. Ann, do you

551
00:52:11,489 --> 00:52:17,589
have any comments for this question?
ANN: Yeah, I think it's like a sum up of everybody,

552
00:52:17,589 --> 00:52:21,569
right? You know, when my I'll take it back
to when my daughter was born, what's your

553
00:52:21,569 --> 00:52:26,038
parenting philosophy? What books have you
read? And I said, hey, I want to not F the

554
00:52:26,039 --> 00:52:36,440
kid up too bad. You know? If she ends up to
be a good adult, self assured. I've taken

555
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:41,630
a lot of courses and read books. But like
Rinki, I've taken more from good and awful

556
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:46,329
leaders. And I have no problem stealing stuff
from great leaders and saying I'm going to

557
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:55,660
bring this into my own thing. And being your
authentic self and showing you care. We have

558
00:52:55,660 --> 00:53:04,399
a lot to learn. I'm at the stage in my career,
and Wendy, you said it, I'll say it more bluntly.

559
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:10,449
I don't care as much about what people think
about me. And there's some privilege in not

560
00:53:10,449 --> 00:53:14,430
having to always tow the company line. I recognize
there's some privilege that. Right? You are

561
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:18,779
at a certain stage of your career, and you
can be bolder and braver and go against the

562
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:24,049
grain. But I'm at that point in my career.
Where I'm saying I want to learn constantly

563
00:53:24,049 --> 00:53:29,900
and ask for and solicit and take feedback.
I make mistakes and I want to learn from them.

564
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:36,549
But there's a certain culture in the organizations
that I'm blessed to be part of. And like Wendy

565
00:53:36,549 --> 00:53:41,420
I don't I roll up my sleeves, I don't care
what part of the team I'm on. And I want a

566
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:45,449
certain culture. If that goes against the
grain a little bit, I'm okay with that.

567
00:53:45,449 --> 00:53:51,720
TRACY: Awesome. Fantastic answers. Little
time check here. We need to start wrapping

568
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:58,569
this up. What I would like to do now is read
something that we discussed on one of our

569
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:04,109
practice sessions and then I'll just do a
quick loop around for some closing comments.

570
00:54:04,109 --> 00:54:08,619
So, what I would like to read is that the
panelists and I would like to close out today's

571
00:54:08,619 --> 00:54:14,499
discussion by remembering two of the great
information security leaders who are tragically

572
00:54:14,499 --> 00:54:20,808
no longer with us, but whose legacy lives
on for us to admire and to aspire to be more

573
00:54:20,809 --> 00:54:27,749
like them. So, first, one of the many ways
Becky Bace was an inspirational leader was

574
00:54:27,749 --> 00:54:34,578
through being a mentor. One of per former
mentees said, I owe my involvement and leadership

575
00:54:34,579 --> 00:54:39,869
in the security profession to Becky. As do
countless other current leads in the profession

576
00:54:39,869 --> 00:54:47,549
today. Becky Bace considered her mentees like
her own children and gladly shared her skills,

577
00:54:47,549 --> 00:54:53,430
contacts and knowledge with them. It's that
kind of selflessness and generosity that also

578
00:54:53,430 --> 00:55:01,299
very much makes you a leader. Dan Kaminsky
showed leadership through his tireless research.

579
00:55:01,299 --> 00:55:07,440
It was said that his passion for sharing,
and learning was infectious and exemplary.

580
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:13,459
Dan showed leadership through his actions
and contributions. One of Dan's friends said

581
00:55:13,459 --> 00:55:19,368
about him: It was never about ego. It was
always about what the best answer to a problem

582
00:55:19,369 --> 00:55:26,199
was. Both of these examples of Becky and Dan
show different ways you can be a leader and

583
00:55:26,199 --> 00:55:32,339
the legacy that you can leave behind.
Let us use them and others as an example of

584
00:55:32,339 --> 00:55:37,709
how we should conduct ourselves within the
information security industry and community.

585
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:46,308
So, let's do a quick round robin final thoughts
on anything leadership. CISO related. Let's

586
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:51,309
start with Ann. We'll just go alphabetical
order here. Ann Johnson, please close us out

587
00:55:51,309 --> 00:55:55,309
for this panel session.
ANN: Tracy, thank you. And thank you for those

588
00:55:55,309 --> 00:56:01,569
memories. And I think we could all aspire,
you know, to be like those individuals. I

589
00:56:01,569 --> 00:56:05,519
want to thank all the ladies here. This has
been fun. The prep for it has been fun. We

590
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:10,479
do a lot of these. You're a group of woman
that I would love to go out and have a glass

591
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,160
of tea with. Which is like, this has been
wonderful. I hope the audience did get something

592
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:20,368
out of it. And feel free to reach out to me.
I'm on a lot of different social media platforms.

593
00:56:20,369 --> 00:56:24,329
I'm happy to help folks. If there's further
questions, don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks

594
00:56:24,329 --> 00:56:30,760
top Tracy, Lena, Rinki and Wendy.
TRACY: Ann, thanks so much. And boops to your

595
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:36,329
pups from us all. Wendy, any final thoughts
for us?

596
00:56:36,329 --> 00:56:45,619
WENDY: Yeah. I got nothing. Which is pretty
much my philosophy of leadership. I'm pretty

597
00:56:45,619 --> 00:56:52,660
sure I have no idea. But lucky, I know a lot
of people who have great ideas. So, you know,

598
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:58,098
I would say, when in doubt, search them out.
You know? When in doubt, go other people.

599
00:56:58,099 --> 00:57:04,789
You don't have to do this alone. And you and
you can do more than you think you can.

600
00:57:04,789 --> 00:57:10,619
TRACY: Wonderful. Wonderful. Rinki. Any any
final thoughts on this that you would like

601
00:57:10,619 --> 00:57:14,589
to share with us?
RINKI: It's an honor being here with all all

602
00:57:14,589 --> 00:57:21,529
of inspiring ladies. I, like, couldn't be
more thrilled. And many women I've looked

603
00:57:21,529 --> 00:57:25,589
up to I've shared with the group before that
I was star struck. I didn't know what to say

604
00:57:25,589 --> 00:57:31,999
when I first got together with the group.
It's an honor. Please stay connected with

605
00:57:31,999 --> 00:57:37,609
me if you're watching this. I'm on Twitter.
Reach out. I love to help other women and

606
00:57:37,609 --> 00:57:43,210
other people in the security space. So, please
reach out any time and at any of the avenues

607
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:47,479
I'm on LinkedIn and Twitter as well.
TRACY: Thank you. And Lena, bring us home

608
00:57:47,479 --> 00:57:51,549
with some wisdom about short bread and tablet
and all things Scottish.

609
00:57:51,549 --> 00:57:59,020
LENA: I had some tablet the other night, ah,
it's just sugar. Now you've made me hungry.

610
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:05,170
I've had the best time. I love talking you
ladies. I could do this all day. I'm just

611
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:10,130
really honored to be part of this group. And
thank you for those really kind words of the

612
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:14,520
people who have gone too soon from this Earth.
So, thank you very much. This was just an

613
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:19,420
honor to be part of this. Thank you.
TRACY: Wonderful. Well, that wraps this up.

614
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:25,999
So, thank you so much to the panelists, to
the organizers, to the volunteers. To my dogs

615
00:58:25,999 --> 00:58:32,448
and husband who have stayed out of the way
for the past hour. And this has been wonderful.

616
00:58:32,449 --> 00:58:38,160
So, thank you all so much. And just have a
great rest of the conference. And just be

617
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:42,149
healthy, be safe. Be great. Be your authentic
self. Bye!

618
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:44,420
LENA: Thank you! Bye!
