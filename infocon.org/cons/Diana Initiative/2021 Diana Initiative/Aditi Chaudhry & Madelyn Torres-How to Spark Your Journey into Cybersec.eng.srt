1
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,000
hi everybody

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,640
welcome back to stage three some of you

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,640
i might have seen earlier but here i am

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,519
again um i'm here to help you through

5
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,400
our next talk

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,199
on how to spark your journey into cyber

7
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,680
security as a software engineer

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,440
we're excited to have you here

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,760
okay

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,320
earlier but here i am again um i'm here

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,920
all right i'm going to try to make sure

12
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,760
i'm not all echoey hopefully that takes

13
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,480
care of that

14
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,480
there was a lot of um need to shut my

15
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,399
door coming up did everybody hear that

16
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,358
or was that just me

17
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,040
i'm here

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,600
you're caring you're good all right

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,640
yeah i thought i shot it ac blew it open

20
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,960
no no problems at all all right we fixed

21
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,560
the sound problem and now we're really

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,360
ready so before we get started i do want

23
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,560
to

24
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,400
to tell people i will be monitoring the

25
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,799
chat i will be monitoring the stage chat

26
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,360
not the event chat so if on the right

27
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,280
hand side of your screen you see the

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,200
little chat screen please make sure

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,119
you're in the stage chat so that your

30
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,880
comments come in to us

31
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,960
that'll be important feel free to put in

32
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,799
your comments i'll make sure to monitor

33
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,360
them and we'll get to them at the end

34
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,680
so up next we have madeline torres and

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,040
the dt

36
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,119
children

37
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,439
madeline and aditi are security

38
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,680
engineers at two sigma investments and

39
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,840
we'll be talking about how to spark your

40
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,600
journey into cyber security as a

41
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,280
software engineer

42
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,240
madeline and aditi you are up

43
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,560
welcome thanks so much for that

44
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,439
so as was said my name is madeline and

45
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,280
this is a dt and we're both security

46
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,598
engineers at a data driven hedge fund in

47
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,440
new york called t sigma

48
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,440
so today we're going to be talking about

49
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,760
how you as a software engineer can kind

50
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,160
of transfer your skill set into security

51
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,680
engineering or just security very

52
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,840
broadly

53
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,599
uh before we begin uh we're going to

54
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,840
drop some links in the chat to a list of

55
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,000
resources which we'll refer to

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,680
over the course of the talk and that you

57
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,160
all can refer to after the talk is over

58
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,760
in addition to that we're also putting

59
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,200
our twitter handles there in case you

60
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,120
want to follow us and ask us questions

61
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,000
after the talk is over

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,720
so uh i'm going to give a quick rundown

63
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,000
of how we're going to be presenting the

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,800
talk

65
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,400
uh dt and we're going to start off by

66
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,160
introducing ourselves and talking about

67
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,680
the kind of work that we do on a

68
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,200
day-to-day basis

69
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,480
after that we're going to talk about

70
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,239
some of the challenges that we ran into

71
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,480
in our specific circumstances in

72
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,319
transferring from software engineering

73
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,239
into security and some of the solutions

74
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,920
that we found were helpful for us into

75
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,040
getting there

76
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,560
lastly we're going to talk about these

77
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,840
skills that we found as software

78
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,840
engineers that were particularly helpful

79
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,680
in our security carriers and then wrap

80
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,760
up with some q a

81
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,440
so before we go into introductions i

82
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,080
just want to do a quick disclaimer

83
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,000
that we are not presenting any financial

84
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,920
information or advice and instead we're

85
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,680
just kind of presenting our stories as

86
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,040
us

87
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,200
so to start off i am going to introduce

88
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,840
myself so as i said before my name is

89
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,000
madeline or you can call me maddie

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,080
and i'm a security engineer to sigma

91
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,640
focusing on application security

92
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,640
so i'll start off by kind of giving a

93
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,720
quick entry onto how i got into security

94
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,879
and computer science very broadly

95
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,680
uh that begins back in middle school

96
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,159
when i was actually first very curious

97
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,920
and kind of afraid of kind of how my

98
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,319
computer's antivirus software worked

99
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,799
and through exploring that i

100
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,159
basically started learning how to

101
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,920
program and just kind of kept security

102
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,560
as somewhat of like a side interest for

103
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,360
a while up until like undergrad when i

104
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,760
actually majored in computer science

105
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,400
my first professional forays in computer

106
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,080
science were in software engineering

107
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,480
which is where basically most of my

108
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,120
internships were in undergrad and it

109
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,840
wasn't really until my like senior year

110
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,358
of undergrad that i first started taking

111
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,440
security classes and then i had interned

112
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,759
at two sigma on the security engineering

113
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,800
team

114
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,720
i then converted full-time i'm still

115
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,479
there as a security engineer as i just

116
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,199
said before and the rest is history

117
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,199
uh just a quick fun fact about me before

118
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,120
i pass it off to dt i have two cats you

119
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,639
can see on the right alphonse on the

120
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,400
bottom i'm on the top

121
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,320
they are lovely though they chew on more

122
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,160
than they should and but that's just

123
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,199
life of cats so i'm not gonna pass it

124
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,199
over to a dt

125
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,199
thanks maddie hi everyone my name is

126
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,199
adidi i'm a cloud security engineer at

127
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,919
two sigma and a little bit about my

128
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,040
journey into security so i started

129
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,880
coding when i was in high school it was

130
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,400
actually mandatory for us to take an

131
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,160
introduction to computer science class

132
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,000
in ninth grade so that was my first

133
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,520
exposure to tech and coding really um

134
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,880
and i actually really liked it i didn't

135
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,479
think i was going to but i did i thought

136
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,880
it was really fun you know to be able to

137
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,880
tell my computer what to do and like it

138
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,039
actually did it that was a really great

139
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,199
feedback loop for me being able to see

140
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,400
my work pay off pretty instantaneously

141
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,320
and so i took a couple of other computer

142
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,240
science classes throughout throughout

143
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,240
high school and decided that when i went

144
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,960
to college i wanted to major in computer

145
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,120
science or computer engineering so i

146
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,120
went to the university of virginia

147
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,720
actually double majored in computer

148
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,639
engineering and computer science

149
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,280
and um did a bunch of you know

150
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,960
internships all were in software

151
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,120
engineering but always was really

152
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,000
curious about security just overall

153
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,400
and

154
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,199
when i graduated uh from undergrad i was

155
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,160
working at a big financial company in

156
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,479
the northern virginia area and i was in

157
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:57,919
this program it was like a college

158
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,319
higher rotational program where

159
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,400
for the first year i was going to be in

160
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,000
one role and then i was required to

161
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,560
rotate a new role and so my first year i

162
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,319
was a software engineer working on a

163
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,319
customer facing application

164
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,720
and at that point i realized i didn't

165
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,560
really want to do full stack development

166
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,319
for the rest of my career i wanted to

167
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,759
try something else like i really wanted

168
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,280
to try security and i was able to

169
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,720
uh through a story i'll tell a little

170
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,639
bit later i actually do my second

171
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,039
rotation in application security so that

172
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,639
was my first real like professional

173
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,360
experience uh working in security i was

174
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,199
doing pen test penetration testing for

175
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,600
about a year then i did a couple of

176
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,319
other projects as a security engineer

177
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,800
before i switched to cloud security

178
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,000
and um

179
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,240
when i joined two sigma in 2019 i was

180
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,479
also doing cloud security and kind of

181
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,400
throughout this whole thing i decided i

182
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,599
wanted to know more about the

183
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,759
fundamentals of cyber security that i

184
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,960
felt were kind of missing from my

185
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,440
undergrad education so i decided to do

186
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,039
my master's at the university of

187
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,360
maryland in cyber security and i

188
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,440
graduated with that degree last year so

189
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,880
it was pretty exciting

190
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,960
and a fun fact about me i'm actually

191
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,039
learning how to play golf right now

192
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:09,759
so

193
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,360
it's pretty fun

194
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,400
and

195
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,840
you know moving on i think a lot of

196
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,919
times when i tell people that like you

197
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,840
know i'm a cyber security engineer i

198
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,240
work in security i do cloud security the

199
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,599
question always comes up like what does

200
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,520
that actually mean like what do i do on

201
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,280
a day-to-day basis

202
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,599
so to answer that um

203
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,680
you know cloud computing comes with a

204
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,599
lot of benefits that developers want to

205
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,840
take advantage of for instance you know

206
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,080
it's easier faster

207
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,759
it's easier and faster to develop

208
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,360
applications in the cloud and deploy

209
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,039
them and

210
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,880
sometimes it's also cheaper depending on

211
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,280
who you talk to but you know it's a

212
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,039
great environment i personally believe

213
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,440
for development um i absolutely love

214
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,919
developing in the cloud and

215
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,919
it's just it's it's fun it's exciting

216
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,919
it's new you know but then the problem

217
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,759
becomes okay so if all these businesses

218
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,360
are moving their applications and their

219
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,039
data into the cloud how are they

220
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,280
actually being secured so that's where i

221
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,919
come in slash my team um we write

222
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,599
products and tools and work with other

223
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,840
teams to make sure that what developers

224
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,919
at two sigma are doing and the

225
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,680
applications they're deploying and the

226
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,280
infrastructure that they're deploying

227
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,960
that that's all secure

228
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,759
and there's two ways that i do this the

229
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,360
first is i

230
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,879
actually write code i will build

231
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,199
products and tools with my team or with

232
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,440
other teams in collaboration

233
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,560
to help secure cloud environments and

234
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,000
the second way to do this is i actually

235
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,839
will partner with these development

236
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,958
teams and work with them um when they're

237
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,039
beginning a new product or a new feature

238
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,880
or something and make sure that you know

239
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,880
we're thinking about security in their

240
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,080
design and their code and their

241
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,399
infrastructure from the start so that we

242
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,720
can avoid any you know crazy

243
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,640
unexpected things later on we want to

244
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,480
catch it all from the beginning

245
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,360
and so you know to dive into a little

246
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,519
bit more of an example one of the tools

247
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,440
that i work on mainly is this is a

248
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,000
automated uh cloud governance system we

249
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,760
call it peregrine which is a type of

250
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,440
falcon but essentially what this does is

251
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,080
there it consists of multiple scanners

252
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,480
and a scanner will have rules and a rule

253
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,880
essentially just checks the service um

254
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,440
in the cloud so you know if it's an aws

255
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,839
it might be checking an s3 bucket if

256
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,680
we're in google cloud it might be

257
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,160
checking and uh like an infrastruc a

258
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,560
compute instance and

259
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,080
you know what we're checking is to make

260
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,560
sure that these resources that are in

261
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,720
the cloud are configured to meet our

262
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,160
security standards and so every hour

263
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,080
our system will run these scanners and

264
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,680
these rules against all of our cloud

265
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,120
accounts and if it finds a

266
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,279
misconfiguration or a violation it will

267
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,519
actually automate i mean oh sorry it

268
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,680
will notify the account owner that like

269
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,519
hey we found this thing here's how to

270
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,680
fix it let us know if you need help so

271
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,519
it's like a really cool way to take

272
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,839
something that would require a lot a lot

273
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,800
of hours manually automate it and just

274
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,360
you know try to bring more security to

275
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,959
our cloud environment

276
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,279
so like how do i actually do this i use

277
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,600
python mainly to do uh all my

278
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,160
application coding i also use terraform

279
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,600
which is an infrastructure as code

280
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,079
language and the two technology i mean

281
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,519
sorry the two cloud platforms that i

282
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,920
mainly use are amazon web services and

283
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,040
google cloud platform

284
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,839
okay so now i'll talk a bit about what i

285
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:28,640
do

286
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,040
so application security at two sigma is

287
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,160
definitely a little broad as you know

288
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,440
even outside of choosing what's even

289
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,440
broader than that but i'll talk a bit

290
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,440
about a slice of what i do in my

291
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,200
day-to-day work

292
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,079
so

293
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,519
before i can kind of dive into like the

294
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,920
kind of tooling that i mostly work on

295
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,079
developing i'll first present a class of

296
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,519
kind of attacks and a supply chain

297
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,880
attack since i feel like that's pretty

298
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,320
pivotal to understanding like what

299
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,800
exactly the tool that i work on does

300
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,760
so just as kind of like a brief example

301
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,360
of what a supply chain attack is so i

302
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,399
think that's probably the best way to

303
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,440
explain it say that you're a as an

304
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,880
example let's say you're a developer

305
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,000
working

306
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,839
on the network of whatever company

307
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,920
you're at and you have a need for some

308
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,399
package that's hosted externally

309
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,360
now

310
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,240
what you're going to do is you're going

311
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,680
to eventually download that package from

312
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,920
that external source and use it on your

313
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,200
own machine

314
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,920
now a malicious party can basically kind

315
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,240
of take advantage of this in a few ways

316
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,560
one way is they could be explicitly

317
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,640
malicious and if they find a way to kind

318
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,560
of take over whatever external

319
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,640
repository is holding this code they can

320
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,240
put malicious code so that way when you

321
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,399
download it and bring it internally what

322
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,920
will basically happen

323
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,800
is

324
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,279
they can find a way to gain access to

325
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,800
the inside of the network which you're

326
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,120
on by exploiting something

327
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,680
inside that package that you downloaded

328
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,800
now another uh possibility here is you

329
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,639
can download a completely legitimate

330
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,000
package that just happens to have a

331
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,480
vulnerability that either is known about

332
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,240
or is not known about and an attacker on

333
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,680
the outside can still take advantage of

334
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,480
that

335
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,160
and so in general that's one sort of

336
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,000
supply chain attack is basically you

337
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,920
leverage some kind of vulnerability from

338
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,240
something upstream that can propagate

339
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,760
then downstream

340
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,480
and

341
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,360
what my exact job is is kind of

342
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,600
addressing this by building a tooling

343
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,560
that can a make sure that whatever we

344
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,720
bring on domain is legitimate and

345
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,880
trusted and even more than that just

346
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,880
making sure that whatever packages we do

347
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,760
have are being used are up to date and

348
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,519
have as minimal vulnerabilities as

349
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,560
possible

350
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,040
so much of my engineering work is

351
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,480
working on creating this tool that can

352
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,680
kind of cross-reference like known

353
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,320
vulnerabilities with the dependencies

354
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,040
that a lot of the code inside our firm

355
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,399
uses

356
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,120
so what what technologies i use to do

357
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,320
that and like how does that journal

358
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,519
workflow go

359
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,600
so in general uh at least in my

360
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,839
experience the the workflows that i have

361
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,639
are very similar to basically most other

362
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,959
software engineers at two sigma except

363
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,200
it's just being applied to a security

364
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,639
specific problem

365
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,720
so a majority of the code that i write

366
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,560
is in python and because of the nature

367
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,680
of victoria oregon uh most code that i

368
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,600
look at outside of python is java

369
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,639
related and perfectly we're also kind of

370
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,959
adopting and looking at go link code so

371
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,440
that's an extra bit of flavor there

372
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,760
and the workflows that i work on a

373
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,600
day-to-day basis are

374
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,200
pretty standard for software engineering

375
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,079
where it's i write code i write tests i

376
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,839
push it to some external code reviewing

377
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,519
tool it gets reviewed and once it's

378
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,279
approved that's pushed and i repeat it

379
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,800
over and over again

380
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,560
uh in terms of like say some

381
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,560
technologies that i work on uh i

382
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,560
definitely use flasks to kind of deploy

383
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,560
some of the services that i have

384
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,199
um we use continuous integration using

385
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,040
jenkins to have with some testing as

386
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,000
well as

387
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,839
some integration with other products

388
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,440
that we have at t sigma

389
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,440
and overall it just tends to be kind of

390
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,440
in line with again other software

391
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,519
engineers at the firm

392
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,079
so now that we have an idea of what a dt

393
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,920
and i kind of do

394
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,680
how did we get here how did we go from

395
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,519
our software engineering backgrounds to

396
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,720
security

397
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,199
so to start off let's first discuss some

398
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,880
of the challenges that we ran into in

399
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,279
our specific circumstances and to begin

400
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,040
with that i'm first going to talk about

401
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,440
kind of our academic backgrounds and

402
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,360
basically the issue of there not being

403
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,000
that many classes at universities

404
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,959
so

405
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,320
to kind of recall what i said before i

406
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,920
went to mit and

407
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,079
there weren't that many undergraduate

408
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,920
classes that touched upon security

409
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,160
topics in fact my first exposure to

410
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,040
security in an academic context was in a

411
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,279
single unit in my

412
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,920
upperclassmen systems engineering class

413
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,160
and outside of that the only other

414
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,680
security classes that there were were a

415
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,399
few of them that were graduate classes

416
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,560
so that was already one initial like

417
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,680
barrier

418
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,199
basically it was difficult to kind of

419
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,040
run into security kind of like in the

420
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,639
wild so to speak

421
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,120
and basically if i wanted to look into

422
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,720
security as someone who already had an

423
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,560
interest in it i had to kind of go out

424
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,399
of my way to look for it and try to take

425
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,399
graduate classes that would where i

426
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,519
would actually learn some of that

427
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,720
information

428
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,560
and it's definitely a common experience

429
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,320
that i've heard from friends at other

430
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,360
universities as well

431
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,839
yeah me being one of them uh so like

432
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,800
maddie said i only had one security

433
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,360
class um in my undergrad curriculum

434
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,199
it was also an elective

435
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,040
which was only accessible when you're an

436
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,440
upperclassman so i think i took it my

437
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,680
junior year of college and it was called

438
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,120
defense against the dark arts so it was

439
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,120
definitely like really fun it was an

440
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,360
intro level security class i learned a

441
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,320
lot and that's what kind of started like

442
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,480
kickstarted my interest in security but

443
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,880
it was a little unfortunate that you

444
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,800
know i take this class it's really great

445
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,560
it was only a semester though i didn't

446
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,480
know what to do after that

447
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,880
and like maddie said also you know a lot

448
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,399
of my other classes

449
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,720
uh we might have talked about security

450
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,639
like my database class maybe we talked

451
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,040
about like sql injection how to avoid

452
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,839
that

453
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,600
that was really it there is nothing

454
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,360
really you know like

455
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,720
you know you take this class in this

456
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,480
class like a 101 a 102 103 type of uh

457
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,120
like ladder that just didn't exist

458
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,320
and

459
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,160
i don't even know about grad classes i

460
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,839
don't even remember like thinking about

461
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,759
like oh as an undergrad can i take a

462
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,920
grad class that never even crossed my

463
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,800
mind

464
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,759
so

465
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,240
you know that was slightly unfortunate

466
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,839
and kind of with that you know

467
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,199
since i

468
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,120
we don't have classes to learn i feel

469
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,880
like you know the next step when people

470
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,079
want to learn about something is like

471
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,680
meet people in the field and like talk

472
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,199
to them about what they do

473
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,880
but we both also found that there were

474
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,959
minimal networking opportunities with

475
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,600
security professionals available to us i

476
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,720
remember

477
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,279
when i was an undergrad that every

478
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,519
career fair like company event a lot of

479
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,600
software engineers would be present like

480
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,839
product managers project managers

481
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,399
executive level people even you know uh

482
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,480
alumni who went to the school and who

483
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,920
are working there and came back want to

484
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,680
share their experience and while that

485
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,360
was all great you know and i learned a

486
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,959
lot about what software engineering and

487
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,039
industry would look like i never met a

488
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,199
security person at any of those events

489
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,439
and when i asked people from the

490
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,599
companies like can you connect me with

491
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,839
someone in security they

492
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,400
almost never knew someone in security so

493
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,599
that was also definitely really

494
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,599
challenging just like as a student

495
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,559
trying to find someone to talk to really

496
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,640
and you know just pick their brain about

497
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,079
what what do you do

498
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,360
and i think the first time i was able to

499
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,799
talk to people in security was actually

500
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,320
after i graduated and was working

501
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,720
full-time

502
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,440
yeah

503
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,600
he said i i feel like i can break down

504
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,120
kind of like the issues i had with like

505
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,120
trying to meet security people as an

506
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,440
undergrad in like three different areas

507
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,760
the first area being like kind of

508
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,000
academics so i know we talked about like

509
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,840
undergraduate classes kind of not really

510
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,320
being super prevalent for security

511
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,400
and i feel like the

512
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,360
kind of corollary to that is i wouldn't

513
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,240
really run into like any faculty or

514
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,679
professors who

515
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,440
were doing any kind of security related

516
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,679
research and i feel like that already is

517
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,679
just kind of like a big like

518
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,679
miss essentially since i know like at

519
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,039
least in other classes i had the

520
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,240
professors would talk about their work

521
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,720
like a decent bit and if you're not

522
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,400
getting the security exposure there that

523
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,320
was already like strike one

524
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,919
the second thing that was pretty

525
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,679
difficult was in any kind of like career

526
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,679
event that i attended an undergrad so

527
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,600
like whether that be career fairs or

528
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,840
external talks that were just hosted in

529
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,880
the area it was like not very often the

530
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,799
case that the individuals who came from

531
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,080
different companies were talking about

532
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,160
security topics in fact i think like

533
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,960
almost ever basically was that the case

534
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,160
like whenever i'd asked the software

535
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,600
engineer like oh like what do you work

536
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,080
on some companies like oh i do full

537
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,840
stack development or like working front

538
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,960
end or like oh i remember this

539
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,200
background team or i do data stuff

540
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,360
and i like at least like in my own

541
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,520
experience i i never met someone like at

542
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,000
a career event that did security unless

543
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,559
it was like a security specific event

544
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,120
um then the third area which was kind of

545
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,240
like a

546
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,480
kind of like the like last kind of

547
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,840
loss there was in a professional

548
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,120
environment in all of my software

549
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,600
engineering internships i never worked

550
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
like on a security team until i was at

551
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,160
two sigma and prior to that whenever i

552
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,919
asked people on my team like oh i'm

553
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,000
interested in security like dean i know

554
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,039
i can talk to you or do you know

555
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,400
anything about the security team at the

556
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,720
company they'd be like oh no sorry i

557
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,160
don't really know anything about her i

558
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,080
don't know anyone there and the best

559
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,200
that they could kind of relay it was

560
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,679
just like general like misconceptions

561
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,679
and at that point it was just a little

562
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,360
like difficult to figure out like okay

563
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,360
well how how can i get the information

564
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,960
about like how this company does

565
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,200
security

566
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,000
so aside from that uh the other thing

567
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,480
that like at least i ran into i know

568
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,400
that some other people have run into

569
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,480
is just like where do you start with

570
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,880
like educational resources so if you

571
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,760
can't really rely on like uh academics

572
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,000
too consistently or just like casual

573
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,520
run-ins to people

574
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,880
um how how do you do that so there are i

575
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,000
mean there are definitely a ton of

576
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,679
security resources out there like we've

577
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,440
definitely compiled like a list and

578
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,720
there are a ton of other lists out there

579
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,039
that people could look into but i know

580
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,120
that for me personally uh it was

581
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,559
difficult to figure out like where

582
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,120
exactly to start and like where to get

583
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,600
like that initial set of information

584
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,880
so

585
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,840
i think like uh like for me like if i

586
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,440
did find like a lot of those big lists

587
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,120
it would get like a little overwhelming

588
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,799
since it would just be kind of like list

589
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,240
of that or like links without any

590
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,320
context and like it would be super clear

591
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,919
like if it was geared towards beginners

592
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,000
or intermediate people

593
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,039
and

594
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,400
that that was already kind of like a

595
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
later stage problem the first stage is

596
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,400
like figuring out like where to look for

597
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,240
the these security resources to begin

598
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,200
with

599
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,520
and that in and of itself is definitely

600
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,760
a challenge depending on like if you

601
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,080
know like where to look and like

602
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,600
like if you do know like where to look

603
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,799
like how to kind of parse that

604
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,360
information

605
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,640
yeah for me i think the

606
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,280
biggest thing was even if i had a list

607
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,799
of links i didn't know if it was like

608
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,720
safe to click on i think i was like

609
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,799
actually legitimately scared to google

610
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,720
some of the things i was curious about

611
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,679
or like

612
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,760
with visit some of the websites because

613
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,440
you know there's like

614
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,200
things that are sometimes sad like oh if

615
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,120
you like google like how to hack a

616
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,960
website or like something like that

617
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,559
you'll like google's gonna flag your

618
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,159
name and you're like getting trouble and

619
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,840
i was just like i just want to do good

620
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,919
in school and graduate you know so i

621
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,679
don't want to get in trouble by googling

622
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,679
something even though like i am curious

623
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,360
about it i just don't want to get in

624
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,120
trouble and same thing with clicking on

625
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,159
links like i don't want to click on

626
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,640
something that looks really sketch and

627
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,360
somehow possibly infect my computer so

628
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,280
for me it was also just like you know

629
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,120
what's reliable and like what's a

630
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,159
trustworthy place to start learning um

631
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,400
even if i like once i had those

632
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,640
resources and just again to echo what

633
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,559
maddie said we did actually compile a

634
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,039
bunch a whole list of resources with

635
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,120
commentary uh

636
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,200
to kind of get around this challenge and

637
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,840
you'll you can find them on our github

638
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,559
at the tiny url that's posted in the

639
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,640
comment section so yeah definitely

640
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,880
please if you if any of this resonated

641
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,720
with you definitely go check it out we

642
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,640
spent time trying to compile this to

643
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,880
help everyone not go through the same

644
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,480
thing

645
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,400
um and then finally i think the last

646
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,720
challenge the biggest one really was

647
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,240
just like this intimidating image of

648
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,480
security for me it was always like you

649
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,440
know

650
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,640
if you're gonna be in security you're

651
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,760
supposed to be a hacker you're supposed

652
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,400
to be like a very good hacker um kind of

653
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,559
only the best can be in this field

654
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,200
really and the other thing for me is

655
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,960
like i i like talking to people and i

656
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,600
like working with people so the image of

657
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,280
a person sitting behind their computer

658
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,039
in a dark room and a black hoodie that

659
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,480
was really scary

660
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,919
that was one of those things where i was

661
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,240
like do i really want to do this for my

662
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,400
career um

663
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
like it seems high stress

664
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,200
from what movies show you um it seems

665
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,400
kind of lonely also and just like you

666
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,760
know

667
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,200
getting over

668
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,000
that fear which i don't even know if i

669
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,240
can say it was a fear it was just like

670
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,039
stereotypes that i couldn't dispel

671
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,960
because i didn't know anything really

672
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,919
and hadn't met anyone yet but just like

673
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,280
you know that was one of the big things

674
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,120
for me you know will i actually fit and

675
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,840
belong there

676
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,640
yeah from my from my own experience and

677
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,720
even just especially talking to friends

678
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,320
when i tell them like oh i'm interested

679
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,320
in security or like oh like now like oh

680
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,880
yeah i work in security it's just this

681
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,240
idea that there's this like

682
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,240
insurmountable learning curve that you

683
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,000
need to have overcome in order to even

684
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,240
consider a career in security

685
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,880
i think like whenever i ask people like

686
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,880
oh like why not security or like why not

687
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,720
look into this like i know that your

688
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,559
interests would overlap with it it's

689
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,440
always like oh well i haven't been like

690
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,679
hacking for like 10 20 years or

691
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,200
something like since i was like a small

692
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,520
child so it's just not even like

693
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,440
reasonable to like look into it i mean

694
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,600
that's just absolutely not the case

695
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,799
um i think that that image in and of

696
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,039
itself is probably

697
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,120
at least like the most like i think

698
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,440
brought up barrier whenever i talk about

699
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,919
security with uh any of my friends or

700
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,240
co-workers who aren't in security

701
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,400
and it's it's actually kind of funny

702
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,400
because then when you start introducing

703
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,000
them like slowly to security things or

704
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,320
like i i dragged a non-security person

705
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,640
to a ctf once they're like oh wow i

706
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,159
really enjoy this and like they're able

707
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,559
to do stuff like initially and it's like

708
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,080
well yeah it's not like this like

709
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,320
majorly arcane thing like if you're a

710
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,159
software engineer you already have like

711
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,440
a decent bit of knowledge about

712
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,760
computers work so that's enough of like

713
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,679
a bit of like a base to kind of start

714
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,360
building any kind of security knowledge

715
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,279
off of

716
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,440
so now that we have gone and talked

717
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,120
about a lot of the challenges we ran

718
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,440
into it would be to not give like some

719
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,760
of our our solutions to it

720
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,559
so to start off uh one of the best

721
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,000
things is to reach out to security

722
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,159
professionals now it might not be super

723
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:05,679
transparent in terms of like how you can

724
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,600
like run into them or like whether or

725
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,320
not these people do exist but i mean the

726
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,840
the answer is like

727
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,840
there are security faculty at like most

728
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,760
universities when you do work at a place

729
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,880
like they almost certainly have a

730
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,159
security team

731
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,000
and it's just a matter of kind of like

732
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,440
trying to find a way to reach out to

733
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,679
these people and more often than not

734
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:24,960
they're they're willing to talk about

735
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,640
their experiences they're more than

736
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,240
happy to talk about what they do for my

737
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,240
from like people i've spoken to

738
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,480
and i think that's like probably like a

739
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,880
very like i don't know very quick ticket

740
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,000
to get someone's individual story like

741
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,159
what resources worked for them when they

742
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,159
got into security and then more than

743
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,159
anything just someone to reach out to if

744
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,960
any questions do pop up to give a quick

745
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,600
anecdote i in one of my previous uh

746
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,039
internships i was doing like data

747
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,120
specific stuff i was fortunate to

748
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,559
finally have a mentor who actually knew

749
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,840
someone on the security team and i went

750
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,039
over and i was a freaked out and i'm

751
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,799
like oh gosh i know what to expect but

752
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,799
it was just like a similar room of just

753
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,400
people like setting up desks like

754
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,760
they're they were having fun having a

755
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,919
good time talking and they're

756
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,240
very happy and willing to share like all

757
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,760
their what they were working on and

758
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,760
we're like oh yeah definitely like you

759
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,679
know if you ever come back like reach

760
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,279
out to us again maybe you can like work

761
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,120
on something and it's like

762
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,799
the the fact that they were so friendly

763
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,919
up front was like a huge relief and be

764
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,320
kind of like revealing to me that well

765
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,240
at the end of the day like

766
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,320
the these people are here also just like

767
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,840
doing security stuff doing computer

768
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,440
stuff and it's not like this like wild

769
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,799
thing off to the side that you need to

770
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,880
like have like these insane credentials

771
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,960
to work on

772
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,120
um yeah

773
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,720
yeah 100

774
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,440
totally echoing that i feel like for me

775
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,600
the biggest thing honestly like so the

776
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,440
story of how i got into application

777
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,400
security i was at a company event and i

778
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,760
was telling my friend who was in the

779
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,320
same program as me but um like the year

780
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,159
above me so he'd already gone through

781
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,159
this i was like you know i really want

782
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,080
to do security for my rotation i just

783
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,080
don't know how i don't know anyone you

784
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,360
know we keep meeting all these people

785
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,880
from all the other like software

786
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,480
engineering towers but i haven't met

787
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,720
anyone from security yet and he tells me

788
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,400
he's like hang on let me go get my

789
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,880
friend so he gets his friend who

790
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,120
um was in security she actually was in

791
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,200
the same program rotated to the security

792
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,960
team and

793
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,880
connected and he connected us and she

794
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,960
was like okay let me go get my manager

795
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,640
so from

796
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,720
me just telling my friend this is what i

797
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,279
wanted like vocalizing that i was able

798
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,520
to meet this other person in security

799
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,760
her manager from her manager he

800
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,279
introduced me to other managers in

801
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,000
security so i could see you know what

802
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,600
teams um

803
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,120
like what the teams were what work they

804
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,440
were doing what i would be interested in

805
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,840
working in since i haven't really done

806
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,559
anything in security yet and that was

807
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,799
just like super helpful and i feel like

808
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,159
you know sometimes it is scary to like

809
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,399
reach out to people who you don't know

810
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,399
but i genuinely believe that like you

811
00:27:58,399 --> 00:27:59,120
know

812
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,480
a lot of people are very nice and they

813
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,240
do want to help you just need to like

814
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,640
take that first baby step and kind of

815
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,799
vocalize what you want and

816
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,120
just put it out there and i think you

817
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,200
know then the domino effect happens and

818
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,480
you get what you want which is great

819
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,240
uh the second thing that we both found

820
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,760
to be very helpful

821
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,159
is self learning so

822
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,200
you know i think everyone says uh you

823
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,039
know you don't stop learning after you

824
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,720
graduate school

825
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,640
learning is like a whole it's like a

826
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,039
lifelong thing i think that's completely

827
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,000
true

828
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
security is always changing because text

829
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,720
always changing and you know when you're

830
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,320
trying to meet people in security and

831
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,600
like talk to them about what they're

832
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,240
doing i think it's really helpful when

833
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,760
you have some background knowledge of

834
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,760
like what's going on in the industry you

835
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,679
know what what just happened what was

836
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,000
like the latest breach or attack or like

837
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,240
what new research just got published or

838
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,159
like what conference just happened like

839
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,720
who was the keynote and like what what

840
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,440
was like did you enjoy that keynote um

841
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,080
just you know continuously learning

842
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,000
about things that are happening in

843
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,600
security or even the fundamentals of

844
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,200
security they definitely take you a

845
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,200
really long way and i would encourage

846
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,799
everyone to not never like stop learning

847
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,000
because

848
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,840
honestly that's the only way you'll grow

849
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,679
and i think that's really important in

850
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,240
security

851
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,159
yeah and i know for for me personally

852
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:26,880
the

853
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,000
manner in which you approach

854
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,320
self-learning as i think like a big step

855
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,440
to it too

856
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,440
because when you do get access to all

857
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,520
these like security resources and like

858
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,440
actually see what's out there um it can

859
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,200
be pretty overwhelming because i i

860
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,720
always hear me what goes on to figure

861
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,159
out like where to start just because i

862
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,840
mean i didn't know anything and there

863
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,360
are so many different subfields and

864
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,000
security to just start exploring

865
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,039
so i feel like the kind of like first

866
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,960
like tip if you're kind of prone to this

867
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,960
like overwhelming information

868
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,919
problem

869
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,559
is to probably just try to find like i

870
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,840
mean look at all the areas see what's

871
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,520
out there and just try to like

872
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,880
see something which you find

873
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,080
particularly interesting and then

874
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,760
probably like deep dive into that rather

875
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,120
than try to like learn everything at

876
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,960
once unless our street like that's also

877
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,760
fine

878
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,559
um

879
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,480
but like for example like i don't know

880
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,080
say you're like a really matty person

881
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:14,799
and

882
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,480
like really interested in data science

883
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,919
like i don't know maybe take a look in

884
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,799
cryptography or say you're like really

885
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,159
like embedded engineering stuff and you

886
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:23,679
did that before then you might be

887
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,520
interested in like looking at lower

888
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,279
level security or like reverse

889
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,799
engineering i think it's closer to like

890
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,240
that kind of stack

891
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,720
so i i think that that's probably like a

892
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,880
good like first place to start is just

893
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,279
find an area which you feel like you're

894
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,159
either

895
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,159
either as close to something you know or

896
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,679
just something that interests you enough

897
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,760
that can keep you going and then i feel

898
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,440
like you can like slowly branch out from

899
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,399
there

900
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,440
um another thing which i feel like also

901
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,440
kind of helped me is if you're fortunate

902
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,200
enough to like find yourself in an

903
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,120
environment at some point where you

904
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,600
can't find other like-minded security

905
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,559
folks i feel like that's like a very

906
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,200
like great space to just like also

907
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,679
self-learn because i mean what's up to

908
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:06,960
it is like you can learn from other

909
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,960
people around you so like for example

910
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,120
like one of the first etfs i did i did

911
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,000
was like a group of people and

912
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,840
you can learn from the people around you

913
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,200
but at the same time i feel like just

914
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,200
like contextually like being in that

915
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,559
environment where everyone's just

916
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,880
hacking away at something i i felt like

917
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,399
more inclined and more focused and just

918
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:25,840
like looking up security things or

919
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,919
working on that and i mean you know for

920
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,760
example being at this conference is like

921
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,519
a great step and great environment to do

922
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,519
that in and there are definitely enough

923
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,519
environments out there that you know

924
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,120
either other people can recommend or we

925
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,240
can recommend

926
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,600
that you can continue to put yourself in

927
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,559
that i think like makes that

928
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,159
self-learning process just like that

929
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,080
much easier

930
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,840
the other thing which i think is

931
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,600
generally pretty helpful especially if

932
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,559
you're from a software engineering

933
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,640
background is to just program

934
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,080
and i feel like that can vary an

935
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,840
involvement from something as little as

936
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,919
like just keeping like secure principles

937
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,240
and like defaults kind of like in mind

938
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,880
when you're programming something like

939
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,480
whatever you're working on

940
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,640
to explicitly doing and pursuing like a

941
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,399
personal project or work related or

942
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,480
school project that is centered around

943
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,640
some secure topic

944
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,279
um i know that one common and like very

945
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,600
like smiles upon thing and kind of like

946
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,039
the engineering community is

947
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,120
contributing to open source projects and

948
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,159
unfortunately like there are a billion

949
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,559
open source security tools and

950
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,720
uh programs out there that would be more

951
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,640
than happy to have like contributions

952
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,480
and i feel like that's like not only a

953
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,679
great way to learn about like that

954
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,840
specific tool and like the topics that's

955
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,080
kind of talking about but also to just

956
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,600
kind of like get involved with other

957
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,519
people in the community and just kind of

958
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,039
start building like that extra bit of

959
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:45,120
knowledge in a security specific context

960
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,960
yeah 100

961
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,880
and if you don't feel like you know

962
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,640
you're ready at this point to be

963
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,720
contributing to an open source project

964
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,159
maybe try

965
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,080
introducing security concepts into like

966
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,679
a personal project that you're doing or

967
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,919
a project at school or even a project at

968
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,840
work like one of the things that i did

969
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,000
that i thought was really cool when i

970
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,320
was a software engineer um

971
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,880
the customer facing website that

972
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,360
i was working on actually dealt with uh

973
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,279
well customer information since it's

974
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,679
customer facing and you know there were

975
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,600
security requirements

976
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,679
that this information had to be dealt

977
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,440
with like you can't have credit card

978
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,760
numbers showing up in your log files and

979
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,679
so like as a software engineer it was

980
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,840
really cool for me to be like okay i

981
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,120
have this set of like security

982
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,559
requirements how am i going to implement

983
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,799
them in my code to make sure that like

984
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,799
our product is actually

985
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,960
not going to cause an audit failure or

986
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,399
something like that for the company

987
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,240
because that would be really really bad

988
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,159
and so just like you know starting to

989
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,000
think about like if i am working on the

990
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,519
software engineering

991
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,360
thing let's say it's like a website you

992
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,360
know what security things can introduce

993
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,519
into there and from there you know i

994
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:52,720
think there's a bunch of different

995
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,720
avenues you could go down you could

996
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,640
think about like authentication or

997
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,000
authorization database security um

998
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,320
how to deal with

999
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,000
data just from like a regulatory

1000
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,919
perspective your options are like

1001
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,840
definitely um

1002
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,079
there's a bunch of them so it's just a

1003
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,000
really great other way to have hands-on

1004
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,480
experience um and be able to show

1005
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,719
something to the future employers or

1006
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,839
anyone that you want to work with you

1007
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,520
know just be like hey i did this cool

1008
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,520
thing check it out it's on my github i

1009
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,199
think that becomes like really powerful

1010
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:26,560
and a really good icebreaker too

1011
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,280
so

1012
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,719
we've kind of talked about our whole

1013
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,719
journey and i think the biggest thing

1014
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,560
that we want to also just

1015
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,159
share with everyone is you know what did

1016
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,560
we learn through this uh through our

1017
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,359
whole

1018
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:38,879
going from like

1019
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,879
baby coders to software engineers to

1020
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,359
security engineers and for me it was

1021
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,280
definitely like one thing that i always

1022
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,879
thought was that i would need a whole

1023
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,079
different skill set when i went to

1024
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,918
security that like all the things i did

1025
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,079
as a software engineer weren't going to

1026
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,320
transfer over and i'd kind of have to

1027
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,320
start like at square one

1028
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,720
and that was so not true you know i

1029
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,000
think that

1030
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,079
what i should have realized which i hope

1031
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,440
this talk will help everyone else

1032
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,000
realize is that i had 80 of the skills

1033
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,800
you know you have a lot of skills as a

1034
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,079
software engineer

1035
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,599
that are directly transferable to

1036
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,599
security there's just a little bit and

1037
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:14,880
that's where the self-learning comes

1038
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,680
from

1039
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,480
so just to go into a little more detail

1040
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,160
of what those skills actually are or

1041
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,240
what i think were the most useful skills

1042
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,839
i learned as a software engineer that

1043
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,680
were applicable in security

1044
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,520
um so the first one was paying attention

1045
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,800
to detail

1046
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,520
you know when you're doing code things

1047
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,359
you get your requirements you need to

1048
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,200
make sure your implementation matches up

1049
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,440
to what the requirements said the same

1050
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,000
thing is so true in security you need to

1051
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,960
like make sure that you know

1052
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,160
when you're coding you're not going to

1053
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,320
introduce a vulnerability uh you know

1054
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,480
the thing that you checked did you check

1055
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,400
all the ports in your network did you

1056
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,480
make sure nothing was left open

1057
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,560
paying attention to those small details

1058
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,200
definitely can make a difference and it

1059
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,160
just makes you like a cleaner security

1060
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,599
professional because people know that

1061
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,000
you're not uh like

1062
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,320
messy or i don't want to say like lazy

1063
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,320
right but you know you you care you're

1064
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,640
like paying attention and

1065
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,320
you are trying your hardest to make sure

1066
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,640
that things are secure

1067
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,280
so the second one is curiosity when i

1068
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,720
was a software engineer people told me

1069
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,359
to ask questions all the time and i did

1070
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,599
because that's how i learned but you

1071
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,200
know i think the other thing in security

1072
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,119
is that you definitely need to ask

1073
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,119
questions because you know and when

1074
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,280
you're when you're sweet it's like okay

1075
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,359
ask questions understand the code base

1076
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,200
and contribute to it when you're in

1077
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,000
security it's ask questions and find the

1078
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,800
weak points of that product or that code

1079
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,440
or that like architecture diagram so one

1080
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,720
example here

1081
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,320
was actually with maddie a couple weeks

1082
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,640
ago we were working on something and she

1083
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,079
asked me a question about why something

1084
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,680
was set up the way it was and i was like

1085
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,440
i'm not actually sure why like i've been

1086
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,440
looking at this code been familiar with

1087
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,280
that code base for almost a year and

1088
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,960
it's relatively new to matty and

1089
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,960
you know that question

1090
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,800
launched a whole discussion of why this

1091
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,880
thing was the way it was we realized

1092
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,720
something wasn't as secure as we thought

1093
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,800
it was for kind of

1094
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,520
you know a couple months and that led us

1095
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,760
to secure it so asking questions is so

1096
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,000
important and nothing is ever a dumb

1097
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,839
question because the discussion that

1098
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,920
comes from it you'll learn something and

1099
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,640
that's the most important thing

1100
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,440
the third skill is teamwork so you know

1101
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,880
i think the

1102
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,520
typical like sweet agile team it's like

1103
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,040
you know people are working together to

1104
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,520
accomplish a goal that could be

1105
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,599
launching a product into production it

1106
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,920
could be like you know developing a new

1107
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,880
feature

1108
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,720
and kind of talking about that

1109
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,040
stereotypical image of being in security

1110
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,440
being by yourself that's so not true

1111
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,599
security people also work on a team like

1112
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,079
you need to be able to communicate and

1113
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,920
collaborate with other people

1114
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,839
regardless of where you are

1115
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,560
and you know if something happens the

1116
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,400
ability to be able to work with other

1117
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,640
people and explain to them like this is

1118
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,320
what happened this is the impact of it

1119
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,320
this is how i think i should fix it that

1120
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,400
goes a really really long way

1121
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,280
so you know it's the same skill set

1122
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,720
whether you're a suite or a security

1123
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,480
professional you're just applying it to

1124
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,400
a different problem

1125
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,560
and that's also very true for the last

1126
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,160
skill that i want to mention here which

1127
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,720
is debugging and you know i think as

1128
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,320
software developers we have a love hate

1129
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,320
relationship with using the debugger and

1130
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,400
an ide because no one likes bugs in

1131
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,160
their code and sometimes it's easier

1132
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,599
just to print everything out and figure

1133
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,280
out what's broken that way

1134
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,160
but

1135
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,800
the skill of being able to step through

1136
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,599
a problem bit by bit and figure out

1137
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,720
what's wrong and figure out like why why

1138
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,480
it's wrong you know it's not enough just

1139
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,839
to identify

1140
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,520
what happened but it's also like why did

1141
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,040
this happen and how to avoid it in the

1142
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,160
future

1143
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,400
i think that is a very very important

1144
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,400
skill in security as well you know if

1145
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,079
there's an incident you want to be able

1146
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,880
to go through the timeline of events and

1147
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,520
see what happened and you know figure

1148
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,800
out

1149
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,320
why it happened and make sure it doesn't

1150
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,520
happen again

1151
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,720
and so

1152
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,880
you know i think obviously there's a lot

1153
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,560
of other skills that you develop as a

1154
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,800
software engineer and

1155
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,920
a lot of other skills that are

1156
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,680
applicable in security but these are

1157
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,879
just the ones i wanted to highlight

1158
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,400
great so now i'm going to go over just

1159
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,720
some examples scenarios very non

1160
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,720
exhaustive subset of cases where we just

1161
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,720
want to try to kind of highlight like if

1162
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,119
it's not obvious like how

1163
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,040
your software engineering skills could

1164
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,599
translate into security contexts

1165
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,920
so as kind of like a quick like

1166
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,440
predecessor to that i'm going to

1167
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,119
highlight with a few terms that i'm

1168
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,960
going to use to kind of just help ease

1169
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,440
the examples uh one thing for those

1170
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,800
unfamiliar is the idea of a red team

1171
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,119
so to be very reductive and simplified

1172
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,760
of it um we're just gonna wait red teams

1173
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,400
are basically kind of like the idea of

1174
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,359
uh individuals whose responsibility is

1175
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,839
from like the attacking perspective and

1176
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,920
their role is to essentially

1177
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,520
look at some kind of product or attack

1178
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,440
surface and try to find vulnerabilities

1179
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,440
that can be exploited in them

1180
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,160
and the flip side to that are people on

1181
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,000
the blue team which you can view as kind

1182
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,480
of loosely as a defense and their role

1183
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,240
is to basically kind of protect these

1184
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,319
surfaces and try to patch any longer

1185
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,040
abilities and prevent them uh from being

1186
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,560
exploited

1187
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,839
so uh now we can go into the examples

1188
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,000
and to kind of like encapsulate all of

1189
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,680
these as a

1190
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,960
fraud

1191
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,440
under a broad like kind of observation

1192
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,839
is that it's very often the case that

1193
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,920
you can directly translate your software

1194
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,319
engineering skills and abilities

1195
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,800
and just apply it to a security specific

1196
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,760
problem

1197
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,480
so one example is kind of maybe the idea

1198
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,640
of let's say you're a full stack

1199
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,760
engineer

1200
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,880
so

1201
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,640
basically you're the individual who's

1202
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,640
going to be creating say like a website

1203
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,200
both the front end and the back end

1204
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,160
and

1205
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,240
who better to understand that system

1206
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,880
than the individual who created it right

1207
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,440
so in kind of engineering this kind of

1208
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,920
product you have the knowledge of where

1209
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,400
the weak points are like what kind of

1210
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,560
like maybe the more uh suspicious bits

1211
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,400
are and that can give you a good

1212
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,079
perspective if you're taking the red

1213
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,839
team approach on

1214
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,000
for similar applications where you might

1215
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,319
want to look to find vulnerabilities

1216
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:27,920
and conversely from kind of like the

1217
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,800
blue team angle like where in other

1218
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,119
applications you want to look for these

1219
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,440
issues that you maybe encountered in

1220
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,119
your previous career

1221
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,200
and try to make sure that those same

1222
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,200
issues aren't present

1223
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,920
now the other example is kind of like

1224
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,079
the direct translation example and i

1225
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,000
feel like we can kind of bring almost

1226
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,960
like a very loose example uh from work

1227
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,079
actually

1228
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,040
and this is basically uh in reference to

1229
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,160
kind of a new product that we're

1230
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,680
developing uh

1231
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,319
in security engineering and we needed a

1232
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,560
front-end developer to develop a ui for

1233
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,480
the security product and we just looked

1234
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,560
out for just other non-affiliated

1235
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,119
security front-end engineers in the firm

1236
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,119
and got someone to help develop this and

1237
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,240
i feel like that's just like a great

1238
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,839
example of like well that's the

1239
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:15,520
front-end example there are definitely a

1240
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,040
ton of other examples where you need

1241
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,119
people who are very specifically like

1242
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,359
knowledgeable in different engineering

1243
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,079
areas to help create security products

1244
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,480
and just for their security like

1245
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,640
projects in general

1246
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,800
so the other thing is kind of in

1247
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,359
reference to the idea of documentation

1248
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,040
documentation kind of debugging i feel

1249
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,280
like is kind of like that like love hate

1250
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,920
relationship uh that developers have

1251
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,880
but it's so crucial and essential to

1252
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,560
engineering any product both from the

1253
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,920
angle of

1254
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,760
trying to just explain how a product

1255
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,480
works and getting uh feedback from other

1256
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,560
engineers on how it should be developed

1257
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,319
and how it should be improved

1258
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,720
to the angle of just teaching other

1259
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,960
engineers how something works that way

1260
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,079
if they're working on it for the first

1261
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,079
time they can get kind of like

1262
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,240
kick-started and that applies to

1263
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,920
security products when we're engineering

1264
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,160
them as well so i can speak for both me

1265
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,000
and dt like whenever we create any kind

1266
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,920
of security product that we've been

1267
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,000
working on we've needed to document it

1268
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,160
and kind of present it that way

1269
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,839
the other angle is again kind of looking

1270
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:20,240
at it from the the wrenching perspective

1271
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,400
and say you're like working on something

1272
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,760
and trying to find like a vulnerability

1273
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,920
is an application and you find something

1274
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,240
that's half the battle the other half is

1275
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,599
making sure that you can communicate

1276
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,200
that effectively enough and kind of

1277
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,760
explain like what the vulnerability is

1278
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,599
like what's its risk like how can you

1279
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,480
explain it and essentially give enough

1280
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,480
information so that it can be fixed

1281
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,480
because in reality finding vulnerability

1282
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,480
is like one step the next step is making

1283
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,040
sure that it's it's actually fixed right

1284
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,520
and having good communication and

1285
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,480
documenting abilities is the like key

1286
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,079
component to actually getting that

1287
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:55,760
across

1288
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,160
the kind of like last uh example that we

1289
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,160
want to bring up is like product design

1290
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,359
and development

1291
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:04,160
so as an engineer it's definitely pretty

1292
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,079
common that you're going to be creating

1293
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:07,440
designing something either on a small

1294
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,839
scale or basically having input on

1295
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:11,599
designing a product like from the ground

1296
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:13,680
up and those like kind of like design

1297
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,000
and product foresight abilities are also

1298
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,920
like very essential in a security

1299
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,040
context

1300
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,480
definitely very clear like if you're

1301
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,079
creating a security product where it's

1302
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,599
just essentially engineering in a

1303
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,040
security context

1304
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,440
how those design skills can transfer but

1305
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,839
just in general it helps to have like a

1306
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,359
great understanding of how products are

1307
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:35,359
developed how things are engineered

1308
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:36,960
because at the end of the day uh one

1309
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,160
thing that you can look at especially

1310
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,000
like in the realm of security

1311
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,079
engineering is that security is this

1312
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,520
kind of thread that can go through all

1313
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,079
these products and in order to kind of

1314
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:47,760
make sure that well if you're getting

1315
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,520
from kind of like this blue team angle

1316
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,960
that they're secure you need to

1317
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,319
understand how they work and you kind of

1318
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:53,599
need to understand this end-to-end

1319
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,839
process so not only make sure that like

1320
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,520
you can identify like how you can make

1321
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,599
something more secure but also that it

1322
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:00,960
can be communicated in a way that can

1323
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,560
fit with different teams timelines and

1324
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,040
making sure that it can actually like be

1325
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,560
considered in the development process

1326
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,000
so now we're going to kind of bring it

1327
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,760
back to dt to wrap things up

1328
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,760
thanks maddie and thanks everyone for

1329
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,240
joining us today for our presentation we

1330
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,079
really hope that you know if any of this

1331
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:22,240
resonated with you that you found you

1332
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,720
found this useful and just to end things

1333
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,319
we kind of want to have a couple of call

1334
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:29,440
to action items so the three things that

1335
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,200
maddie and i both found useful and

1336
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,599
getting into security we encourage you

1337
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,160
guys to kind of follow a similar suit uh

1338
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,000
so the first one is to connect and

1339
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,880
engage with five people uh this weekend

1340
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,720
at the conference i pick five because

1341
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,400
it's like a lucky number for me but you

1342
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,920
know the good thing is maddie and i can

1343
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,480
be two of those five and you know i

1344
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,560
think conferences are a great way to

1345
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,160
meet people in that work and there's

1346
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,640
even a networking portion of the diana

1347
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,240
initiative so it makes your life a

1348
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,520
little bit easier

1349
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,280
uh the second one is to check out the

1350
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,520
ctfs that are happening for hands-on

1351
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,240
experience like maddie said and i also

1352
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,920
agree they're super fun they're really

1353
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,160
great way to just you know learn new

1354
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,800
things in a gamified environment which

1355
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,960
you know who doesn't like and the last

1356
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,200
one um for continuous learning subscribe

1357
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,680
to a newsletter or a blog post or a

1358
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,680
podcast even uh just to make sure that

1359
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,520
you know you're on top of all the

1360
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,920
security things that you want to know

1361
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,839
and with that we'll take questions now

1362
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:29,520
um but

1363
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,480
uh really quick while we do questions um

1364
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,960
we are hiring so if

1365
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,800
there's gonna be links in the chat for

1366
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,880
that and

1367
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,400
i don't know what's wrong with my deck

1368
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,880
but we are hiring so if you are looking

1369

for a job definitely check us out we

1370
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,640
both love our experiences here and happy

1371
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,040
to take questions now

1372
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,160
awesome ladies that was truly inspiring

1373
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,000
thank you so much for sharing you really

1374
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,920
made my heart kind of pitter-pat when

1375
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,000
you talked about life-long learning in

1376
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,400
particular that's that's a hot spot for

1377
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,960
me and i love to hear folks coming in

1378
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,800
and saying like look you you have to

1379
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,160
keep learning because security is

1380
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,400
ever-changing and you have to keep

1381
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,560
learning or you fall behind super quick

1382
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,960
we do have some interesting questions

1383
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,520
one of them coming in asks what did you

1384
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,400
find harder to find a cyber security job

1385
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,280
or a developer job because

1386
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,280
they're about to graduate from college

1387
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,920
in a few weeks and are kind of in

1388
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,000
between both of them applying to both of

1389
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,760
them but are just kind of interested in

1390
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,559
the prospects

1391
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,319
yeah um i can go first really quick so

1392
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:40,319
definitely check out our career links um

1393
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:41,359
quick plug

1394
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:42,720
feel like recruiting will be very happy

1395
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,119
with us for saying that uh but honestly

1396
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:46,960
so i think when i was graduating college

1397
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,720
it was easier for me to find a software

1398
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,160
engineering job um than a security job

1399
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,160
but i also wasn't looking for security

1400
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,160
jobs so that was kind of on me

1401
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,280
but when i was finding my current job at

1402
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,400
two sigma uh it was much easier to find

1403
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,800
a security job i like set some filters

1404
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,640
on linkedin to say like what i was

1405
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,319
interested in and then i was getting a

1406
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,880
lot of uh like recruiters messaging me

1407
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,400
about roles that i was more interested

1408
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,319
in from like a security perspective than

1409
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:16,800
a software engineering perspective but i

1410
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,240
would also say apply to both because it

1411
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,599
doesn't hurt to keep all your options

1412
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:21,839
open

1413
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,319
yeah i kind of regret that like

1414
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,559
i can speak more from like the i guess

1415
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:30,079
like intern new grad experience

1416
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,160
but i know that like when looking for

1417
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,160
internships and also like new grad

1418
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,520
opportunities

1419
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,480
um there weren't i didn't see as many

1420
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,720
like security engineering jobs in

1421
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,040
particular um i didn't look like too

1422
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,119
closely until like kind of like a

1423
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,800
incident response or like analyst kind

1424
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,720
of roles but i do know that those are

1425
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,400
also pretty present

1426
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,599
um

1427
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:52,960
another thing to keep in mind though

1428
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,880
with kind of like the like development

1429
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,480
versus like security kind of like if

1430
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,000
you're open to for both of those at the

1431
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,119
same time

1432
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:01,280
is that uh you're not necessarily i

1433
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,040
guess like limited to one if you start

1434
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,040
off in the other

1435
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,000
so like i guess i'm like uh like our

1436
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,760
particular case like we definitely know

1437
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,559
people who joined as software engineers

1438
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:14,400
and then like within a year just switch

1439
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,400
teams to security

1440
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,839
so i think that's like another thing to

1441
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:19,760
keep in mind uh it definitely varies

1442
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,599
between companies but

1443
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:22,800
um

1444
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,480
i think also like an extension to like

1445
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,480
what a dt said like i've seen like a

1446
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,880
billion opportunities uh for security

1447
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,480
like once you're already like pass up

1448
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,720
then you go to stage so definitely think

1449
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,240
like just keep an eye out for both and

1450
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,760
just know that like it's not like set in

1451
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,359
stone whichever one like you can land

1452
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:41,440
that's awesome i have a i have a

1453
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,520
personal question because i think it

1454
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,720
runs the same challenge as the um

1455
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,200
isolated hacker in the hoodie but both

1456
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,680
of you mentioned ctfs being super

1457
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,920
helpful and one of the things that i've

1458
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,599
found is that either people don't know

1459
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:59,200
what ctfs are or believe that they have

1460
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,880
to um

1461
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,119
be already experts to even participate

1462
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:05,680
in the ctf so what kind of

1463
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,359
if you can think back

1464
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:09,280
how did you get involved in a ctf like

1465
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,839
what got you to your first ctf and kind

1466
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:12,559
of

1467
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:15,119
how do we get more people to recognize

1468
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:18,079
the value of those

1469
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:21,839
so for me personally um my company the

1470
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:23,839
first one i joined out of undergrad they

1471
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:25,760
were doing a company wide they call it a

1472
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,920
hackathon and i think calling it a

1473
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,319
hackerthon instead of ctf help because

1474
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:31,839
software engineers were very familiar

1475
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:34,880
with hackathons and i think that

1476
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,960
change of word uh kind of made it more

1477
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,040
approachable but yeah this company wide

1478
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,800
we all sat in a bunch of like huge

1479
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,640
conference rooms with pizza and we're

1480
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,280
hacking away and it was really fun um

1481
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,800
and it was like a really cool way to

1482
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,040
like learn more about security with my

1483
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,760
friends at the company um it was you

1484
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,359
know during work day so who doesn't love

1485
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:56,000
just eating pizza and like hanging out

1486
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,119
but no i think it's a really good

1487
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:58,240
question i think there were a couple of

1488
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,400
talks today actually um like you know if

1489
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,559
it's your first ctf what to do so

1490
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,400
hopefully people are able to check that

1491
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,359
out but i think maddie has a link that

1492
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:09,839
she added to the resources on how to

1493
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:11,599
find ctfs

1494
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:13,760
right maddie

1495
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,760
yeah yeah

1496
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,200
yeah there are a few places that you can

1497
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,960
look at that just like kind of update a

1498
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,880
ton of ctfs that are going on

1499
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,280
awesome

1500
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,920
there's also a question in the chat

1501
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,400
about how do you break into the field if

1502
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,800
your work experience is completely

1503
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,800
unrelated

1504
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,000
yeah i think that was

1505
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,599
one of the hardest things for me too

1506
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,440
like how do i convince someone in

1507
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,760
security to like i guess take the chance

1508
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,280
on me as a software engineer and i think

1509
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,119
it's a couple of things we talked about

1510
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,520
you know networking and making that

1511
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,119
connection so

1512
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:54,880
that person will take that chance on you

1513
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,559
like they feel good about it you know

1514
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,720
but also you know

1515
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,000
kind of what maddie was talking about

1516
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,079
doing the hands-on experience stuff

1517
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,480
contributing to open source projects

1518
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,319
putting things up on github

1519
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:08,800
that all that counts like just because

1520
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,880
it's not a job that doesn't mean you

1521
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,839
don't have experience um if you can show

1522
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,359
what essentially i would say is like a

1523
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:17,680
portfolio of security work that you've

1524
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,480
done

1525
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,839
um

1526
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,920
like i a lot of people will take that as

1527
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,880
experience 100

1528
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,599
yeah i i feel like at least like from my

1529
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:30,800
my own personal experience just like

1530
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,880
talking to other people i feel like just

1531
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,359
having that initial interest in security

1532
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:37,280
is already just kind of like probably

1533
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,359
the biggest boon to get you started off

1534
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:40,880
because well i mean that definitely

1535
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,480
leads into like the curiosity of like

1536
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,079
exploring all these resources and trying

1537
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:46,640
to build that security knowledge but

1538
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,640
at least like oh like at least a lot of

1539
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,319
the other security people i've met are

1540
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:51,920
pretty enthusiastic to like talk about

1541
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,359
security and like other people who are

1542
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:54,720
into it as well

1543
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,559
so that that's just kind of the first

1544
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:57,760
thing and

1545
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,760
that leads into kind of like the

1546
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,920
like for me i had just basically just

1547
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,319
kind of asked about it like i was like

1548
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:06,640
oh okay like can i join a security

1549
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,559
specific team and i did that enough

1550
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:10,000
times that eventually it ended up

1551
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,400
working so i i know that that was

1552
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,920
beneficial uh for people who i know that

1553
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,359
um

1554
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:19,359
didn't like have like that exact same

1555
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:21,920
route uh there's also the route of just

1556
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,760
like kind of like a dt said just kind of

1557
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,160
like taking those extra opportunities to

1558
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,040
learn

1559
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,440
or like contribute to the projects or

1560
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,680
even like i mean kind of mention this

1561
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,240
also the resources a bit but like

1562
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,760
studying for certifications i know it's

1563
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,359
like a common thing that people do like

1564
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:39,040
if they have no background in security

1565
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,640
it's just kind of like kind of a good

1566
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,720
way to not only learn stuff from a

1567
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,880
theoretical kind of standpoint and like

1568
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,599
flash a bit hands-on but also just have

1569
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,920
like a legitimate like sort of

1570
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,760
certificate at the end that can be like

1571
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,000
okay like i do know some things in like

1572
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,520
a certified manner

1573
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,800
good

1574
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,640
um there's a question in the chat what

1575
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,359
if previously in the software field but

1576
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:05,520
you took a long break and your coding

1577
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,160
skills are stale

1578
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,920
um i don't mind doing a little coding

1579
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,520
but i don't want to be a developer

1580
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,119
yeah i feel that on a very personal

1581
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:19,359
level that was that was very much me um

1582
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:21,599
when i was doing penetration testing my

1583
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:24,000
coding skills just like went like that

1584
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,119
um

1585
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:28,319
i would say if

1586
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:30,240
you if you know what part of security

1587
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,960
you're interested in and it's not coding

1588
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,240
heavy

1589
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,480
then i think just like brushing up on

1590
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,480
the basics like you know maybe python

1591
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,200
scripts or something um that would be a

1592
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,559
that would be okay

1593
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:43,760
uh

1594
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,119
i think you know

1595
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,520
insecurity at least coding is a tool to

1596
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,760
get things done it's not like the main

1597
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:50,559
thing

1598
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:53,119
that you necessarily need depending on

1599
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:55,680
the role um so you know if you don't

1600
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,839
want to be a dad there are

1601
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:00,079
roles in security that don't require you

1602
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,079
to code um

1603
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:03,280
and i think that's just like a

1604
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,799
conversation that you have like during

1605
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:06,480
the interview process or with the hiring

1606
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,000
manager like what are the

1607
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,559
responsibilities of this job role and

1608
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:12,240
how much like coding will it involve and

1609
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,520
i've definitely done that like i've

1610
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,760
asked before because i didn't want my

1611
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,720
job to be 100 dev work and i didn't want

1612
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,559
it to be like a hundred percent pen

1613
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:22,799
testing i wanted it to be in the middle

1614
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:23,920
and

1615
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,799
i have found that so yeah go me um but i

1616
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:30,319
think just like you know celebrating

1617
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:32,880
um billy having that conversation i

1618
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,880
think is it's a it's a legitimate

1619
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,640
conversation to have you know if it's

1620
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,960
not something that you don't want to do

1621
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,880
you shouldn't take the job for that's

1622
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,000
going to require you to do it

1623
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,520
yeah

1624
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,520
the other end of that like i know that i

1625
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,760
i definitely wanted like i think like a

1626
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,359
good balance between the like

1627
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:52,640
development and coding because i

1628
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,240
definitely still wanted to have like a

1629
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,559
developer experience and i feel like the

1630
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,240
core conversation i've had with both

1631
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,400
like uh the team at two sigma i like

1632
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,640
interviewed with initially and also just

1633
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,880
like speaking to other people is i think

1634
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,079
i think it's very important to kind of

1635
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:07,760
like discuss that expectation ahead of

1636
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,599
time how much like dev work are you

1637
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,520
gonna do versus like how much security

1638
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,520
work uh especially if you're looking at

1639
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,680
with security engineering roles but if

1640
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,200
you're looking at like roles that don't

1641
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,680
necessarily like include a ton of like

1642
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,680
dev work like i guess like as a part of

1643
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,920
like the like expectation

1644
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,040
then they're definitely like a ton of

1645
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,880
like analyst kind of roles or like other

1646
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,799
just like security roles that like don't

1647
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:30,720
necessarily like require coding and

1648
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,000
instead of like the software engineering

1649
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,760
skills rather than like an expectation

1650
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,839
or just like definitely just like the

1651
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,440
more you have it's just like a benefit

1652
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,440
and you can just kind of like use it and

1653
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,040
develop it like kind of like at your own

1654
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:44,040
pace

1655
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,160
there's another question in the chat

1656
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,720
what would be a portfolio of security

1657
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:49,680
stuff

1658
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,680
i have been told hack the box and try

1659
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:55,280
hack me scores is that right

1660
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,200
if you're trying to build a portfolio

1661
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,559
you can put out there for for

1662
00:56:59,559 --> 00:57:02,960
hireing people

1663
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,240
yeah

1664
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:04,960
so

1665
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,720
for portfolio security stuff there

1666
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,559
there's definitely like a ton of things

1667
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,400
ranging from just kind of like

1668
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,400
general experience and kind of like

1669
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,400
skill sets to tangible kind of

1670
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,160
deliverables so i know i mentioned

1671
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,000
before certificates and that's like one

1672
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:18,880
thing

1673
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,880
uh the other thing is like if you

1674
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,119
participate in ctfs or these kind of

1675
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:24,480
like security challenges that's

1676
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,760
definitely something to include on there

1677
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,599
too i feel like you don't necessarily

1678
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:30,160
need to be like a top scorer in it like

1679
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,680
just so much as like saying like oh i

1680
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,200
feel like i feel like just communicating

1681
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,960
that you like do that and have enjoyed

1682
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,720
that is already one step in the right

1683
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,000
direction

1684
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,280
um especially uh

1685
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,640
especially like in the realm of like

1686
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,799
kind of like dev work intersecting the

1687
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:46,960
security if you want to talk about that

1688
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,200
um this also goes back to just like

1689
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,440
either working on like contributing to

1690
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,079
existing uh projects that intersect with

1691
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:56,400
the security area or just doing personal

1692
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,839
things i feel like you don't even need

1693
00:57:57,839 --> 00:57:59,280
to make like something like incredibly

1694
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,200
like novel like invent this like a new

1695
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,440
cryptographic algorithm i feel like just

1696
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,240
expressing like oh yeah i have this like

1697
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,079
github repo where like i just

1698
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:09,440
implemented a ton of like cool

1699
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,799
cryptographical things and like

1700
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:12,799
integrated and this like random like

1701
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:14,799
thing i was interested in i feel like

1702
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:16,720
that like is very much an extension of

1703
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:20,160
like the like developer portfolio where

1704
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,920
as long as you're just kind of like

1705
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,440
working on that skill set and showing

1706
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,000
that like you're actively working on it

1707
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
i think that's like a way to build it up

1708
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:34,240
great i think we're winding down on time

1709
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,359
