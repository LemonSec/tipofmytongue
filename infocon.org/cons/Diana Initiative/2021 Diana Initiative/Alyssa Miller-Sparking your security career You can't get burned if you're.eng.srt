NICOLE: Scroll all the way to the bottom of
the stage. There's a link to live closed captions

4
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:26,490
provided by Amanda of White Coat Captioning.
She is not an AI. But a professional at helping

5
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,660
make things accessible to all. Please click
that link to get your live captions, which

6
00:00:31,661 --> 00:00:35,940
open in a new window that you can place as
needed.

7
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,489
Our captions were paid for by our sponsor,
Corelight. We appreciate their commitment

8
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:45,960
to inclusion by covering that expense. We
were really hoping to be in Vegas initially.

9
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,670
But we think it worked out to be in Hopin
again this year. Hopin has improved over the

10
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:56,070
last year. So, if you were here last year,
it still isn't perfect, but it has gotten

11
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:03,760
a bit better.
This year our slogan is spark a journey. We

12
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,750
hope over the course of the event each one
of you finds things that spark your interest,

13
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,969
your passion, your creativity, and new pathways
into and through your information security

14
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:23,899
journey. I want to stress that the Diana Initiative
acknowledges everyone is a multi dimensional

15
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:32,240
complex being. For those here, security may
be a job, a hobby, or a passion. We're encouraging

16
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:39,210
to light a spark. But I don't want to limit
you to just professional stuff. Make a friend

17
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:49,020
in the networking area. Find a new hobby in
the hands on labs. There's lots of options.

18
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:57,449
We encourage all of you to be kind. It has
been a really rough year. And who can't do

19
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:03,219
with a little extra kindness? It's important
to remember that you all agreed to follow

25
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:56,400
I want to thank our sponsors. Without them,
we could not have afforded this platform,

26
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:04,541
our live captions and all of the other expenses
that go into making a conference happen. This

a well known hacker who can clearly explain
any complex issues. I cannot express how happy

39
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:07,140
I am that Alyssa accepted our invitation to
be our keynote and start our event. Without

40
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:27,190
further ado, here's Alyssa.

42
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,880
ALYSSA: Hey, everyone! Welcome to Diana Initiative.
And Nicole, thank you so much for the introduction

43
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:22,290
and, oh, my god. I am I'm equally thrilled
to be here. Getting that invitation to join

44
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:28,910
all of you and to be just to have this opportunity
to deliver an opening keynote at an event

45
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:37,570
that has meant so much for me over the years.
I just this is I couldn't be happier. And

46
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:44,560
what a great theme for this year's event.
Sparking your Journey. So, we're gonna talk

47
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:54,280
about that today. Sparking your security career.
You know, so many of us we wonder every day,

48
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,010
how do I get ahead? How do I achieve these
goals? When is the right time to take that

49
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:06,260
leap of faith and go after that next job or
that exciting new opportunity? Do I take this

50
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:13,310
risk or is that, you know, do I have the ability
to really do it as I think I want to do? And,

51
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:20,540
you know, it all too often, we get held back
for one reason or another, right? We don't

52
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:26,400
we're afraid that we're gonna get burnt. But
the reality is, if you're the flame that ignites

53
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,979
your career, you can't get burnt. So, let's
take a step back first.

54
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:38,140
Now, I love hiking. And a lot of people who
love hiking also go camping. So, imagine this

55
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:45,020
for a minute. You're gonna go on a trip. You're
gonna go hiking somewhere. And you maybe spend

56
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:50,440
system time by a lake doing some camping.
And so, your mind is just filled with these

57
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:57,030
ideas of what it would be like to, you know,
camp out on the shores of a small lake. Maybe

58
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:02,390
build a big campfire that you can just sit
around with your friends, anyone that, you

59
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:07,469
know, whoever it is that you're hiking or
camping with. And do the things you do around

60
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:12,720
a fire. Maybe it's making s'mores or sharing
stories or whatever. But this is your goal

61
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:20,140
to be in this position. Laid out there, just
chillin', loving life, enjoying nature on

62
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:25,409
the shores of the lake.
So, what do you do? Well, of course, you start

63
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:32,799
to make plans. Maybe this is something you've
you've never done before. And so, you might

64
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:37,549
start just doing some investigation. Like,
how do we get there? What do I need to take

65
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:43,539
with me? How do I go about getting this campfire
built? And so, you'll start to read about,

66
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:47,860
well you're gonna need to bring campfire wood
because trying to find it in the woods that

67
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:53,600
day might be pretty tough. And you start putting
together all these ideas and before you know

68
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,319
it, you've got a plan. You know exactly what
you're gonna do. You're really excited. And

69
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:03,170
so, you start collecting all those things.
You're getting wood together, you pack that

70
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:09,459
up to take with you. And you're all fired
up. But then you start telling your friends

71
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,709
about your plans. And think about this for
a minute. Maybe you start asking other people

72
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:20,859
for their ideas, their thoughts or, you know,
maybe pointers on how to do it.

73
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,980
And then all of a sudden they start filling
your head with images like this. Campfires

74
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,360
gone wrong! They're telling you about all
the things that can happen where someone could

75
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:37,470
get injured in a campfire like this one here
where two teenagers got severely injured.

76
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:44,560
And suddenly they start filling your mind
with doubts. Can I really do this? Start thinking

77
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,750
of all the things bad things that could happen.
Well, maybe I'm just not ready, I've never

78
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:57,269
done this before. Maybe I should take a smaller
step. Maybe I this might not just be the right

79
00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:04,110
time to do this trip. And suddenly, you're
second guessing everything. You had this great

80
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:08,420
idea. You knew where you wanted to go, you
knew exactly how to get there, you laid it

81
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:14,849
out, you built up the skills you needed to
make it happen. But still somehow people got

82
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:21,310
you second guessing. Maybe it was yourself.
Maybe you told yourself stories in your head

83
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:26,630
during that research you came across different
horror stories. Whatever it was. But somehow

84
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:35,140
you got to that point. This is what happens
in our career journeys. Far too often. We

85
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:40,800
lay out those goals. We know how we want to
get there. We research, we study. We develop

86
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:48,490
our skills. We gain experience. And yet when
the time comes to take that next leap, we

87
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:55,000
let all of these voices get in our heads and
tell us now is not the time. These are the

88
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,139
reasons you shouldn't go for that next position.
These are the reasons you shouldn't take that

89
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:06,079
leap and start your own business.
And we talk ourselves out of it. Sometimes

90
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,819
those voices come from outside. Sometimes
they're just voices in our own heads. But

91
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:19,089
somehow we hold ourselves back. Cybersecurity
is this industry where we have all this opportunity

92
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:24,800
to do so many great things.
There's no reason that we can't get out there

93
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:33,839
and yet, sometimes we just we don't do it.
So, let me start by sharing with you a little

94
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:40,949
bit of my perspective. How I got where I am.
And the stumbles that I encountered along

95
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:47,560
the way that threatened to hold me back. You
see, I got started in cybersecurity and in

96
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:55,138
tech before I was even out of college. Okay?
I was 19 years old.

97
00:11:55,139 --> 00:12:01,170
I had enrolled initially in college as a premed
major. Despite all the things I had done,

98
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:05,660
buying a computer when I was 12 years old
and hacking into online systems, teaching

99
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:10,610
myself programming. All these things. I never
really thought that computers were going to

100
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:19,579
be my career path. I thought, naw, you know,
I was all hell bent on being a surgeon. So,

101
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:25,670
I enrolled in pre med. Three semesters into
college level chemistry and I'm like, peace

102
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:30,479
out. I can't do this. This is not for me.
I am not gonna enjoy this life. I need to

103
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,889
go in a different direction.
So, I scrambled. I had to find a new major.

104
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:42,589
And I looked through the course catalog and
I found that they had a computer science degree.

105
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:46,990
I already knew how to program like I told
you. And I thought this will be an easy thing

106
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:54,449
and I got into that degree major, into that
particular degree program. This is where serendipity

107
00:12:54,449 --> 00:13:01,410
starts to take over in my career path. I was
19. I was still enrolled full time in school.

108
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:07,040
But it was the dot com era. We were just learning
all the things the Internet could do. Things

109
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:13,129
like e commerce were exploding on the scene.
And organizations that wanted to chase down

110
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:18,839
that path were hiring programmers wherever
they could find them. And, at 19 years old,

111
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:28,879
I got my full time first salary job as a programmer
for a Fortune 500 financial technologies firm.

112
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:33,470
I was lucky. I got lucky. You know? At least
that's what I told myself.

113
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:38,970
I just happened to be in the right place at
the right time. So, I sat in that role for

114
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:44,620
9 years. And I continued to advance. I was
a senior developer, I was the lead, you know,

115
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:50,990
a team lead. I was I did lots of really cool
things. I built lots of great software. It

116
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:56,329
was a payment processing platform that is
still in use today when you make your electronic

117
00:13:56,329 --> 00:14:02,388
bill payments to other people or to businesses.
Somewhere in there, I'm sure some of the code

118
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:08,120
I wrote scary enough is probably still there.
But then at 28 I had a manager from the security

119
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,570
team reach out to me and ask me if I wanted
to join her security test team. Now, she knew

120
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:17,420
me because we had worked on other projects
before, and she came to me and talked about

121
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,868
it a little bit. And I told her, I said, you
know, I don't know anything about penetration

122
00:14:21,869 --> 00:14:27,100
testing. And she looked at me and she goes,
that's all right. You're smart. You'll figure

123
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:35,089
it out. That's why I asked you. Okay. Well,
I guess if you're confident it's something

124
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:39,300
new and different I could try. And I did it.
I joined the penetration testing team.

125
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:47,389
Again, kind of serendipitous. It wasn't anything
that I laid out in my career plan. And you

126
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:54,480
know what? It turns out I was actually pretty
damn good at that. In fact, by the time I

127
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,139
was 31, I was leading not only that team,
but the entire vulnerability management program

128
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:05,060
for the organization. And this wasn't a small
organization. In fact, by this point, we had

129
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:11,279
gone through a massive merger. We were now
a company of 35,000 people globally. I was

130
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:17,499
managing teams around the globe. And I was
managing vulnerability management for over

131
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:27,050
900 applications and tens and tens of thousands
of systems.

132
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:31,498
But it never really struck me that, like,
okay. 31 and I'm doing this for what was now

133
00:15:31,499 --> 00:15:43,839
a Fortune 200 company. I just got lucky. So,
then at 35, I I had now switched into security

134
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,240
consulting. After 15 years of at that organization,
I wanted to see what the rest of the world

135
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:53,069
was doing, I got into consulting. And at 35,
I joined an organization in their application

136
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:59,240
security practice. Now, that practice was
the least profitable practice in the entire

137
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:05,999
company. All right? They were struggling mightily.
I came in. I didn't I came in as a managing

138
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:11,529
consultant with no team. The goal was they
wanted to expand, and it was my job to build

139
00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:16,139
another team. I had two other peers who were
managing consultants, had teams of their own.

140
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:22,369
I needed to build mine. So, I did that. But
more importantly, I worked with my director,

141
00:16:22,369 --> 00:16:28,559
our practice director, and you know what we
did? We turned that practice around completely.

142
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:35,449
400% growth in 18 months. We went from the
least profitable practice to the most profitable.

143
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:40,670
My team, that team that I built from the ground
up was the single most profitable team in

144
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:47,050
the entire company. Across all practices.
But, you know, I got help from my director.

145
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:51,878
He's the one who really helped me get there
and see the, you know, where we could maximize

146
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:57,459
our profitability and so forth. So, you know,
I mean, how much of that's really on me? Then

147
00:16:57,459 --> 00:17:04,389
at 37, that organization went through a massive
overhaul. They were acquired by another company,

148
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:10,069
and they merged together. I left. I joined
a new company. As the head of their program

149
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:17,359
services program. So, now I'm leading an entire
consulting practice. And that consulting practice,

150
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:23,479
program services, we weren't focused on doing
pentests and, you know, tactical assessments.

151
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:32,380
I was working with CEOs, CIOs, CISOs, of major
global organizations, government entities.

152
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:39,420
Helping them build application security practices.
That's what my consulting practice was all

153
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:45,970
about. And I was head of that practice. I
reported into the COO. But, I mean, that it

154
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:51,270
was just, again, it was a course of lucky
events.

155
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:56,650
And then when I turned 41 I was working for
yet another consulting organization. And my

156
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:02,970
director left. And when he left, one of the
things he did was he recommended me as his

157
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:09,700
successor. Not just to the VP who would be
the hiring manager to bring in the replacement.

158
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:16,590
But to the executive committee of that organization.
And yet you know what happened? I got passed

159
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:26,490
over. I didn't feel that I was treated fairly.
And in that moment I started to wonder, was

160
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:32,540
I just not ready for that level of role? Was
trying to be the director of a billion dollar

161
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:39,360
sales organization, sales and consulting organization,
was that just... I wasn't ready to be there

162
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,139
yet? And I really started to second guess
myself. It really destroyed my self confidence.

163
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:48,480
Despite everything that I had done up until
that point, I didn't feel like I could be

164
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,320
worth consideration for a role like that.
In fact, I ended up leaving that company.

165
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,870
Because like I said, I didn't feel, and I
still today don't feel I was treated fairly

166
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:03,290
in that process. And I got out of leadership
roles all together. I went to an individual

167
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:09,350
contributor role. I changed my goals completely.
Instead of wanting to accelerate up and to

168
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:16,830
one day lead an entire security organization
as maybe a CISO, I instead went into this

169
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:22,669
individual contributor role and said I was
going to focus on traveling a lot and my public

170
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:31,390
speaking that I was already doing.
And it was while I was in that role that another

171
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:38,700
seemingly serendipitous opportunity happened.
One of the big three social media firms had

172
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:46,190
started an executive search. And that executive
search company reached out to me. Out of the

173
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:51,970
blue. And asked me if I was interested in
putting my hat in the ring for this position.

174
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:56,930
Now, that position never actually happened.
They ended up they didn't create the position

175
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:01,300
they thought they were. They went on a different
route. That happens all the time. But the

176
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:08,250
fact that I was asked to be a part of that
got me thinking. I started looking at my LinkedIn

177
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:13,190
profile to see, like, how did they get to
me? How did they pick me?

178
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:20,980
And I started looking at all of this and I
realized something. I did I always looked

179
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:27,160
at everything I had done as luck. It was just
pure luck. I had help, I got there, you know,

180
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:34,420
just because I worked with awesome people.
And finally, as I looked back on it and considered,

181
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:41,570
how did I end up in that executive search?
I realized... I've actually done some really

182
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:49,409
incredible things in my career.
So, I took a chance. I networked, I reached

183
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:53,790
out. I connected with somebody who I had been
connected with for some time on social media.

184
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:59,920
She was a CISO of S&P Global. A company that
I knew something about because everybody's

185
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:06,980
heard probably of the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones
Industrial. Or you've heard the name Standard

186
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:14,280
& Poor's. That was that company. She had a
position that she was talking about on LinkedIn

187
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:21,180
for a business information security officer.
And as I read up on it and I found out what

188
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:27,830
it was, I was excited.
This was the chance to direct the security

189
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:34,960
strategy for a multi billion dollar credit
ratings division within S&P Global. She got

190
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:41,480
me connected with the hiring manager. And
over the course of that, it ultimately worked

191
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:48,120
out, I got hired to that role. As you heard
Nicole mention in her intro, I am now the

192
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:55,000
business security information officer of S&P
Global ratings. Every day I wake up and hear

193
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,760
my company in the news because they're talking
about what the S&P 500 is expected to do today.

194
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:09,261
Or talking about a credit rating or the outlook
for countries like Australia recently. These

195
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:14,500
are exciting things that my organization does.
And to know that I'm leading a multi billion

196
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:20,020
dollar division's security strategy? That's
exciting.

197
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:26,810
This is one huge step closer to my goal of
someday being at the head of an enterprise

198
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:35,139
organization's security team as a CISO. This
is what happens when you get over all the

199
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:39,770
fears, all the self confidence issues and
you go for it. You shoot your shot to get

200
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:46,740
that thing that you want. Go for your goals.
This is how it works. But there are those

201
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:52,140
things that hold us back and we need to understand
them in order to understand how to overcome

202
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:56,920
them.
And the reality is, if you're a man in this

203
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:04,370
industry, a lot of these things don't hit
you the way that they hit others. So, let's

204
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:09,879
start by talking about some of the things
that derail women in particular and other

205
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:17,010
non males, non binary, for instance, as well
in our careers.

206
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:25,910
Things that affect us disproportionately to
other demographic groups. So, 2020 was particularly

207
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:30,390
hard on women. If you've read some of the
studies that have been done over the course

208
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:36,130
of the pandemic, and just the stats that they've
found, the fact that women have disproportionately

209
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:43,400
left the workforce over the course of the
pandemic over men. Well, some of that happens,

210
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:48,481
and this I find this mind numbing as I started
to research why this was happening. There's

211
00:23:48,481 --> 00:23:54,150
still this belief in society and it's a prominent
belief. It is still the majority, in fact,

212
00:23:54,150 --> 00:24:00,790
of people in technology today who believe
that for women, work should be secondary.

213
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:08,350
Women are still expected to be the ones in
the home raising children. Making the home.

214
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:11,699
And if they can fit in a career too, great.
Good for them. We love to have them. But,

215
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,070
you know, what? At the end of the day their
priority needs to be that home and family

216
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:21,100
life. Men don't get that same expectation.
Men are expected to be out there bringing

217
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:26,351
home the bacon, if you will. Working in high
level positions in large organizations. Making

218
00:24:26,351 --> 00:24:31,610
lots of money, supporting their families.
There's still this bias from years and years

219
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:37,459
and years ago of women's place is in the home
first. If they want a career and they can

220
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:43,290
make all that work. Great. But they're the
ones responsible. This still occurs today,

221
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:49,590
and I found study after study that talked
about this. Surveys that showed this in result.

222
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:57,540
This is what we as women have to overcome.
It's not easy. Because it is such a predominant

223
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:05,210
attitude even today. And as a result of this,
if you're male, you're expected to over work.

224
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:12,970
If you're anybody in technology, value is
placed on over work. Putting in 50, 60, 80

225
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:19,580
hours and as you climb the ladder, those expectations
grow. Let me tell you. I experience it firsthand,

226
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:26,879
and I have to I have to build those boundaries.
But the reality is, because of the focus on

227
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:38,820
women being homemakers first and career people
second, we're expected to put in even additional

228
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:45,000
levels of over work and over to overcome in
order to establish our value to the organization.

229
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,820
And the only way for us to stand out is to
do that. That's the expectation that's hoisted

230
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:56,060
upon us. But employers want to fix this, right?
Employers want to be better, they want to

231
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:04,310
be more welcoming to women. So they create
all of these women focused initiatives and

232
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:08,470
benefits and things. But unfortunately, these
have unintended impacts because they end up

233
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:15,020
creating offramps. Excuses for women to get
out of the workforce. Think of maternity leave,

234
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:20,870
for instance. As organizations have implemented
maternity leave beyond just the legal requirements.

235
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:26,879
But putting long runways out there for women
to be home with their children. How far behind

236
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,550
are many organizations in that they don't
offer the same level of paternity leave? So,

237
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:37,990
if you want to argue that first point isn't
true, go no further than that spot there.

238
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:42,881
Women are the ones expected to be home. Yes,
there's a medical piece to that as well. But

239
00:26:42,881 --> 00:26:47,860
shouldn't the men be home able to be home
with their wives when if they are recovering

240
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:54,320
from a medical thing? The fact of the matter
is, the way that had these programs get set

241
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,450
up, they create offramps that make it easy
for women to take a detour and get out of

242
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:05,360
their careers. It's not intentional. It's
not something that has, you know, any type

243
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:12,530
of malicious focus. But it happens.
And as a result, we have this lack of representation.

244
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:19,750
And I cannot tell you I can't express it in
words. When you can't see the people that

245
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:26,841
look like you in those higher levels that
you aspire to, it matters. For women, for

246
00:27:26,841 --> 00:27:33,239
non binary individuals. For the LGBT, for
Black women and men who don't see themselves

247
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:40,150
reflected at those higher levels. Those lack
of role models can be very discouraging. When

248
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:46,000
you walk into that executive committee meeting,
or you walk into that board meeting and you're

249
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,220
the only woman or the only Black person or
the only Mexican person or the only Latino

250
00:27:52,220 --> 00:28:02,860
or whatever group you want to you want to
cite that you may identify with. That impacts

251
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:08,810
you. And it discourages you from wanting to
go further. It hurts your self confidence

252
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:13,409
because you feel like you don't belong. And
this is something that we're forced to have

253
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:19,570
to overcome.
But that's not the only thing. I know we talk

254
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:24,070
about this a lot in security. In fact, there's
a talk coming up later today about imposter

255
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:29,781
syndrome and how to overcome imposter syndrome.
You see, a lot of what I told you about in

256
00:28:29,781 --> 00:28:35,230
my own path was imposter syndrome. That idea
that well, I got lucky.

257
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:43,701
well, I had help to get to those impressive
things that I did. Let me tell you now. Everyone

258
00:28:43,701 --> 00:28:51,200
gets lucky. And everyone gets help along the
way. It's what you do when you get those opportunities.

259
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,821
It's how you leverage those lucky breaks.
It's how you work with those people who can

260
00:28:56,821 --> 00:29:03,610
help you that makes your success happen. And
everybody that has been successful has had

261
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:09,399
to go through that. And by success, I mean
achieving your goals.

262
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:14,500
You don't get there by yourself. But the problem
is, and maybe you've seen this diagram before.

263
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:19,400
I wish I knew the origins. I've seen it in
a number of books. I don't I can't credit

264
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:24,310
the person who originally did it because I
don't know who they are. But we have this

265
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:29,149
idea, as we talk in cybersecurity, and we
see a bunch of people talking about different

266
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:35,520
topics. We assume that they know everything.
Cause we see all these different voices talking

267
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,700
about different aspects of cybersecurity that
we don't know. We just lump all that together

268
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:45,090
and give them credit for some level of collective
knowledge. They know all the things. While

269
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:52,449
I only know this much.
And this leads to that feeling that you know

270
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:55,360
what? One of these days I'm going to guess
exposed as a fraud. Somebody is going to ask

271
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,610
me a question about something that I don't
know about. It's a part of the pink circle,

272
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:08,459
not my green circle there. And it hold uses
back. It causes us to fear going for the next

273
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:13,440
big step, that next big opportunity. But the
reality is this be this is what people's knowledge

274
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:20,680
look like. Everybody has their own specialized
area. There is so much to know when we talk

275
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:27,250
about cybersecurity. We can't any one of us
ever possibly know all of it. I think about

276
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:35,340
voices that I see in the media. Like Katie
Moussouris or Dave Kennedy or Ian Coldwater.

277
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:39,470
All of these amazing individuals who are doing
awesome things and many times things that

278
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:48,240
I don't know anything about.
I see people like Lesley Carhart giving amazing

279
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:58,120
talks on ICS security. And I'm blown away
because I know almost nothing about ICS. But

280
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:06,629
what I've learned is that there are things
that I know that Lesley and Dave and Katie

281
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:13,190
they would love to know more about what I
know. Sometimes they've asked me.

282
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:20,010
That's the reality. Every one of us has those
areas of this knowledge base that we're interested

283
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:27,640
in, and we dig into. But we don't know it
all. None of us do. Every one of us has that

284
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:34,750
area of knowledge that we have that's special
and unique to us. And it overlaps with others.

285
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:41,010
But nobody's got it all on lockdown. And understanding
how to see that and acknowledging that. And

286
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:45,490
acknowledging the knowledge you have is every
bit as important. Even if you know nothing

287
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:50,830
about cybersecurity at all. You still bring
valuable perspectives and knowledge from whatever

288
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:57,379
experiences you've had before into this space.
Cybersecurity isn't just an industry anymore.

289
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:02,550
Cybersecurity is about defending our very
way of life. Digital technology is ingrained

290
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:08,950
in everything we do.
The people issues that we have to deal with

291
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:13,950
require people solutions. That's why social
engineering has blown up so much in the last

292
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:19,180
few years. All of the perspectives you might
bring from any other job role, whether you

293
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:25,480
worked in retail or as a barista at Starbucks.
You can bring all of that to bear and that

294
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:31,450
has value in cybersecurity. So, it's important
for you to recognize that. And own that and

295
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:39,650
learn how to leverage that to your advantage.
Now, speaking of job searching. I mentioned

296
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:47,570
going from pivoting out of retail and or,
you know, a service job like being a barista

297
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:52,879
into cybersecurity. The problem is, those
job hunts can be tough too, can't they? And

298
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,350
part of the reason is that job descriptions
suck.

299
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:02,469
Nicole mentioned I'm I'm an author. I'm currently
authoring a book on beginning your career

300
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:11,180
in cybersecurity. As part of that, I did a
lot of research. I researched job descriptions.

301
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:19,020
I interviewed recruiters. Hundreds of them.
And I found some interesting things. Job descriptions

302
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:25,020
are awful. They look like this. Look at this.
This is a three page job description. We just

303
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:30,250
made it bigger for you and I'm sure most of
you can't still read the text. This is a high

304
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:35,880
level position, information security architect.
But look at this laundry list of requirements

305
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:41,600
and technologies and responsibilities. Where
are they ever going to find a unicorn who

306
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:48,840
matches up to this? They won't.
But if you, like me, have read studies on

307
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:55,270
this, you know that they've found that men
are better suited to applying to roles like

308
00:33:55,270 --> 00:34:01,240
this simply because they're more willing to
take that leap. In other words, what they've

309
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:06,870
found is that men will look at this list of
bullet points and if they meet about 25 to

310
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:16,509
30% of it, they feel qualified, and they'll
apply. For others, we look at it and we're

311
00:34:16,509 --> 00:34:22,739
like, ah, you know, 70 to 80% we expect to
be able to tick off all those boxes before

312
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:30,138
we're feeling comfortable to apply.
It's not that the men are any more skilled

313
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:35,599
than anyone else. That's just the mindset
they have. Now, we could argue for days on

314
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,349
where that mindset comes from. That's not
important. What is important is as you look

315
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:44,739
at job descriptions like this, understand
that they're trash. Understand that this is

316
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:53,089
garbage. And then move on from it. Read the
description of the role itself. You see it

317
00:34:53,089 --> 00:34:59,130
here. Information security architect plays
an integral role in defining and assessing

318
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:05,779
the organization's security strategy, architecture,
and practices. Focus on that line. Does that

319
00:35:05,779 --> 00:35:10,730
sound like something you can do? Do you feel
like you could learn on the drive on the job

320
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:16,119
and make that happen? Then forget all these
bullet points and apply.

321
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:22,079
Now, Stephanie's gonna talk tomorrow in her
keynote more about how to hack your job search

322
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:26,450
and how to take a very different approach
to interviews and everything else. And we're

323
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:29,339
gonna talk a little bit more about that today.
But I encourage you to check out that keynote

324
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:33,630
Tomorrow morning because she's going to arm
you with valuable tools in this regard as

325
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:40,319
well. But what you need to focus on here is
how do the skills and experiences you do have,

326
00:35:40,319 --> 00:35:45,580
even if they come from working at Starbucks,
nothing to do with cybersecurity at all. And

327
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:52,640
I realize it sounds like I'm picking on Starbucks,
I'm not. The point is, if you don't have cybersecurity

328
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,250
experience, you still bring valuable experiences
to job descriptions like this. Understand

329
00:35:57,251 --> 00:36:03,100
how you can identify the core skills that
transcend tries that you have and apply yourself

330
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:07,288
to that role and sell yourself in that best
light.

331
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:18,349
Now, one of the biggest areas where we stumble
in our job search is knowing our own worth.

332
00:36:18,349 --> 00:36:23,460
I just coached somebody through a job search
recently. And in her job search, she asked

333
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:31,619
me multiple times, she was worried about her
current salary and what her salary goals were.

334
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:38,720
She was worried because in the past she hadn't
made the level of salary that she was asking

335
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,500
for in the new roles, that was going to be
a problem. When you apply for a job and you

336
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:50,460
get a job offer, you don't get paid based
on the salary you have now or the salary you

337
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:57,089
had previously. You need to be getting paid
for the job you're gonna do in that role.

338
00:36:57,089 --> 00:37:03,630
This is an important distinction. Many states
now, employers, aren't even legally allowed

339
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:11,619
to ask you about your current compensation.
There's a good reason for that. Because your

340
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:17,520
salary that they offer you should not be dependent
on what your current salary is. It should

341
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:24,150
be based on what their salary range is for
that job and where you fit in terms of qualifications

342
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:30,760
so they can place you in that range. Period.
End of story. As someone who has hired countless

343
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,670
individuals, I can tell you that's how it
works at the end of the day. We look at that

344
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:39,059
whenever I look at hiring somebody, it's never
about what are they making now? It's how well

345
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:43,859
qualified they are for this position? Where
do they qualify in the spectrum? And I'm going

346
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:54,190
to have the salary in the range in that position
commensurate for how well they fill that role.

347
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:58,980
This means you need to go out and do research.
Use your network to discover when somebody

348
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:07,170
in a senior security architect role makes.
Use Indeed, Glassdoor, they all share some

349
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:13,970
salary information. It may not always be accurate.
But more often than not, it will give you

350
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:17,999
some idea.
I can tell you personally, in my role that

351
00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:22,660
I'm in now as a BISO, this is something I
did. And when I got into that job and started

352
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:28,299
talking about salary, I already knew what
their range was before the HR person told

353
00:38:28,299 --> 00:38:33,390
me so. He basically confirmed for me that
I was right. And I had found that information

354
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:39,769
on Glassdoor, in my case. Now, if you're not
comfortable talking about what salary expectations

355
00:38:39,769 --> 00:38:43,660
you have, it is okay to turn that around on
the recruiter and specifically ask them, well,

356
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:50,799
what is your range? The recruiters I talked
to said they would happily share that information.

357
00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:56,009
Most organizations have no problem. If you
ask, they will tell you what that range is.

358
00:38:56,009 --> 00:39:00,589
They don't always offer it up. They still
do sometimes try to guard that information

359
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:06,410
a little bit. But we're moving away from that.
And you can help that motion by not being

360
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:11,788
afraid to ask.
Hey, what are you willing to pay? Or at least

361
00:39:11,789 --> 00:39:18,039
go in there and have an idea of what you want
to ask for. People get afraid to ask for too

362
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:21,450
much. They're afraid, if I go in and say this
is my salary demand, they're just going to

363
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:26,390
end the interview right there. No, they're
not. They're going to come back and tell you,

364
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:31,029
well, this is the maximum that we can pay
for that. And then you're gonna let them know

365
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:37,250
whether or not that would be enough to get
you to come in. And the reality is, they expect

366
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:42,440
that. They're not going to look down on you
for that. So, don't be afraid to have those

367
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:50,559
conversations. They are crucial.
And the reality is, think about this for a

368
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:55,700
minute, if they weren't willing to share that
information with you, if they were going to

369
00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:00,730
be so guarded about that they were gonna keep
it a secret from you, consider if that's a

370
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:04,839
company you would really want to be working
for anyway. If they're gonna shut down an

371
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:10,480
interview because you asked for a number that
was too high without even trying to talk to

372
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:16,839
you more about it, is that the kind of company
you want to work at? Think about that.

373
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:30,400
What about this idea of mentorship? Mentorship
is so important. How do we establish these

374
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,160
connections with others? We hear about mentorship
all the time. We hear women in particular

375
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:41,848
being encouraged to find mentors. We hear
I've seen it in LGBT spaces where we get encouraged

376
00:40:41,849 --> 00:40:47,920
to find mentors because we don't have the
opportunity to see ourselves represented at

377
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,880
high levels oftentimes. But a lot of the time
when we talk about mentoring, unfortunately,

378
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,990
what people talk about is leveraging mentoring
relationships to learn job skills or to get

379
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:03,930
career coaching. And that's all good. That's
all necessary. But we need more than that.

380
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:07,118
Mentoring needs to be about more than just
learning skills. It needs to be learning about

381
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:12,019
your mentor personally. That is the value
of having a mentor. You want to learn about

382
00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:19,479
the struggles and triumphs they had. How they
got there. The closing keynote tomorrow, Rin

383
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:26,080
Oliver is going to talk about how you break
through after you've had a setback. Their

384
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:30,538
talk is about rising from the ashes. Check
that out tomorrow. Stick around. Make sure

385
00:41:30,539 --> 00:41:37,529
you don't miss that final keynote. Because
everybody goes through that. And learning

386
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:42,609
how others have dealt with it will not only
equip you with valuable knowledge about how

387
00:41:42,609 --> 00:41:48,950
to rise from those ashes, as Rin is going
to talk about. But it is also help you see

388
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:56,109
that everybody goes through those same struggles.
So, when you stumble, it's okay. It's part

389
00:41:56,109 --> 00:42:01,540
of the process.
Now, the other thing your mentor can do for

390
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:05,711
you. As you establish a really good working
relationship and your mentor sees what you're

391
00:42:05,711 --> 00:42:12,819
capable of and understands what your career
goals are and you develop that rapport, your

392
00:42:12,819 --> 00:42:18,249
mentor becomes part of your network. I mentioned
before how I leveraged my network to find

393
00:42:18,249 --> 00:42:24,078
my current role. That is something you want.
You need those allies out there helping. And

394
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:28,809
it's not just that you reach out to them when
you're looking at a job or something. But

395
00:42:28,809 --> 00:42:32,839
imagine they understand what it is that you're
trying to accomplish and what you're capable

396
00:42:32,839 --> 00:42:37,119
of. They may hear of a position that you haven't
heard of yet and they could actually bring

397
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:42,819
that to you. That is what you're looking for
in your mentorship relationships. It's not

398
00:42:42,819 --> 00:42:50,810
just career or skills coaching.
It is so much bigger than that. And mentoring

399
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:55,808
relationships don't have to be these big formal
relationships. Sometimes they are. Sometimes

400
00:42:55,809 --> 00:43:00,130
you'll reach out to somebody and ask them
to be your mentor, you'll set up a regular

401
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:05,220
cadence on which you get together, and you
talk about things. Honestly, from my personal

402
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:10,140
experience, the best mentoring relationships
I have grown organically. Just people I worked

403
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:17,589
with, or I met professionally or in some other
aspect and we just kind of became friendly.

404
00:43:17,589 --> 00:43:24,109
Maybe not friends per se, but we developed
a relationship at a professional level.

405
00:43:24,109 --> 00:43:30,549
And soon that trust grew, and I was able to
ask them sensitive questions. I was able to

406
00:43:30,549 --> 00:43:36,160
learn from them. I was able to see how their
career journey developed. I was able to talk

407
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:45,649
with them about situations I was experiencing.
That's what mentorship should be about.

408
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:52,309
Recognize when those relationships come your
way. Grasp on to them. Use them to your advantage.

409
00:43:52,309 --> 00:43:58,099
And be willing to give back as well in those
relationships. Sometimes your mentors can

410
00:43:58,099 --> 00:44:05,160
learn from you too. Any good mentor realizes
that. They have so many lessons to learn from

411
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:10,730
you because your perspectives are different
than theirs. You're coming this world from

412
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:19,319
a very different background than theirs. So,
be willing to provide that value back as well.

413
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:25,839
Now, let's talk more about that job search.
I mentioned before. Stephanie has a great

414
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:31,788
talk in her keynote tomorrow on really approaching
the whole interview process differently. So,

415
00:44:31,789 --> 00:44:35,730
be sure to get up early again tomorrow, check
that out.

416
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:40,900
But it is important that in that job search
we start to think about those denials differently.

417
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:47,960
We've all gotten 'em, right? Everybody gets
'em. I have. Every job search I've ever gone

418
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:54,460
through I've gotten denials, multiple denials,
oftentimes, before I found that job that gave

419
00:44:54,460 --> 00:45:01,220
me an offer and an offer that I accepted.
It happens. That is part of the process. And

420
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:09,348
probably the biggest struggle here is understanding
that it's not personal. You're interviewing

421
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:12,460
them, they're interviewing you all at the
same time. You're trying to figure out if

422
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:18,130
they're a good fit for you. They're trying
to figure out if you're a good fit for them.

423
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:22,089
And if they come back and they ultimately
determine that someone else was a better fit,

424
00:45:22,089 --> 00:45:27,940
they're not telling you that you're not valuable.
That you wouldn't be a good fit in their role.

425
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:32,680
It's just maybe that somebody else was a better
fit. And that can be for lots of reasons.

426
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:37,569
It could be that they had just one special
skill that you didn't have that was particularly

427
00:45:37,569 --> 00:45:42,769
important for that job. Or maybe it is that
they just happen to have the right network

428
00:45:42,769 --> 00:45:47,470
that they were already connected with someone
on the inside. Sometimes that happens too.

429
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:52,419
Maybe they were an internal candidate. Which
immediately makes it easier for an employer

430
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:57,529
to go that direction because it's a known
quantity. It's less risk for them. Just understand

431
00:45:57,529 --> 00:46:05,820
it's not a personal statement on you or your
skills or your personality or anything else.

432
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:10,609
These denials are an opportunity to learn
more about yourself and to learn where you

433
00:46:10,609 --> 00:46:19,619
can get better. Get feedback when you get
those denials. It is 100% perfectly valid

434
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:23,059
to ask that recruiter when they send you a
message saying that they've decided to go

435
00:46:23,059 --> 00:46:28,519
in a different direction, you can come back
and ask them, would you be willing to share

436
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:34,049
with me what I could do or how I could develop
more that would have made me a better fit

437
00:46:34,049 --> 00:46:38,859
for this job? Sometimes they will. Sometimes
they won't.

438
00:46:38,859 --> 00:46:44,970
Indeed, there are unfortunately some organizations
out there in the tech space who actively announce

439
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:50,569
that they won't provide that type of feedback.
In my opinion, that's a huge mistake. And

440
00:46:50,569 --> 00:46:56,759
I think it's actually a pretty toxic way to
relate with the workforce. But I can't argue

441
00:46:56,759 --> 00:47:01,780
with 'em. They're big, successful companies
and that's what they do. Maybe they've got

442
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:06,239
a perspective on that I don't know. But the
reality is that most organizations will have

443
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:11,680
those conversations, will share that feedback
with you if you just ask for it.

444
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:17,319
Now, I don't like to look at denials as failure.
I hate that idea. We talk about failures a

445
00:47:17,319 --> 00:47:26,210
lot. But if we're going to look at them as
failures, let me throw a cliche at you. Failure

446
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:33,820
is part of learning. In fact, failure is how
you learn. If you set a goal out there and

447
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:40,369
you immediately obtain it. You didn't grow
or learn anything through that process. It's

448
00:47:40,369 --> 00:47:46,640
when we don't achieve a goal. It's when we
have those setbacks. It's when we get those

449
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:53,799
denials that now we've got an opportunity
to learn and grow. And that's how we get better.

450
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:59,950
So, look at your job search that way. Go in
with the expectation that you are going to

451
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:05,288
get denied. Even that job that you are so
excited about, it seems like such a perfect

452
00:48:05,289 --> 00:48:10,829
fit. And you're so confident you're gonna
get it. I know it hurts when they come back

453
00:48:10,829 --> 00:48:15,589
with that rejection letter.
I've been there. We've all been there. It's

454
00:48:15,589 --> 00:48:23,859
tough. Process those feelings. They're valid.
But then come back to it. And try to sit with

455
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:28,900
that and look at it objectively and see how
it can be a force for good. See how that's

456
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:32,799
going to be something that's going to move
you to the next level. Appreciate the fact

457
00:48:32,799 --> 00:48:38,119
that it's a risky thing when you're trying
to hire something and they're trying to do

458
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:43,160
their best job. And if they didn't think you
were a fit, maybe you weren't. And the last

459
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:48,038
thing you want to do is land in a job where
you're not a good fit. And maybe they were

460
00:48:48,039 --> 00:48:54,450
wrong. Maybe you would have been the absolute
best person for that role. Maybe they made

461
00:48:54,450 --> 00:49:01,279
a mistake. Again, try not to take that as
a personal affront to you. Just understand

462
00:49:01,279 --> 00:49:08,950
that the whole process of hiring is so imperfect
and so fraught with risk. We all do our best.

463
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:15,000
Sometimes it just doesn't work out.
So, keep working. Keep developing and you

464
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,089
know what's gonna happen? Eventually you're
going to get that job offer. All right. So,

465
00:49:20,089 --> 00:49:25,519
the company came back to you. They gave you
that job offer. You open that email. You look

466
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:32,959
at the maybe they sent it in a PDF and it's
not the salary you wanted. You were hoping

467
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:38,710
for more. They didn't give you the variable
compensation, the bonus program that you were

468
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:45,339
looking for. Maybe you didn't get the number
of weeks of vacation that you were hoping

469
00:49:45,339 --> 00:49:51,759
to get for that level of role.
Does that mean you're out of it? Does that

470
00:49:51,759 --> 00:49:58,220
mean you just have to accept what they've
put on paper or walk away? 100% emphatically:

471
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:09,180
No. That is not what that means. That is not
at all what that means. I mentioned interviewing

472
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:15,930
hundreds of recruiters. You know what? Every
one of them expects you to come back with

473
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:26,098
a negotiation. And it's not just about salary.
Okay? You can negotiate the variable compensation

474
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:33,739
package. You can negotiate the number of vacation
days that they're going to give you.

475
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:38,020
What you need to understand is what's most
important to you. And are there things that

476
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:41,640
can offset? So, for instance, if they come
back to you with a salary that isn't what

477
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:45,900
you were expecting or isn't what you were
hoping for and you ask for more. They might

478
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:50,930
come back and say you know what? That's the
top of our range. We can't go any higher.

479
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:58,729
Maybe they can give you a signing bonus. Maybe
they can give you more vacation time. Are

480
00:50:58,729 --> 00:51:03,210
you willing to accept those things? The fact
of the matter is, when you go into this, don't

481
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:07,960
be afraid to negotiate. I talk to people who
are afraid to negotiate because they're worried

482
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:14,231
that the company's gonna rescind the job offer
if they do. Now, if you come back and you

483
00:51:14,231 --> 00:51:20,119
ask for double what they've offered, yeah,
they're probably gonna pretty much be ready

484
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:24,819
to walk away.
But if that's really what you were hoping

485
00:51:24,819 --> 00:51:29,599
to get paid for that role, if they offered
you 150,000 and you said, no, I want 300,000

486
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:35,339
and you feel the role is worth that, well,
then, do you really want to go in there at

487
00:51:35,339 --> 00:51:40,099
150,000 anyway? Probably not. You're never
gonna be happy in that role. You're gonna

488
00:51:40,099 --> 00:51:45,109
feel consistently under paid. So, that's okay.
But the fact of the matter is, again, they

489
00:51:45,109 --> 00:51:48,450
expect you to negotiate. They're not gonna
walk away simply because you asked for more

490
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:54,649
money. They're not going to rescind that job
offer sir that job offer, excuse me. And again,

491
00:51:54,650 --> 00:52:00,150
if they do, is that a company you want to
work for? Do you want to work for a company

492
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:04,309
who has such a toxic relationship with their
employees that they won't even negotiate job

493
00:52:04,309 --> 00:52:11,220
offers? I don't know about you, but for me.
That's a nonstarter. That's a huge red flag.

494
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:19,689
That's a company that can go somewhere else.
You don't need that. There are over 4 million

495
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:25,499
to 500,000 job security offers out there depending
on who you believe. You can find a job with

496
00:52:25,499 --> 00:52:32,410
a good organization. You don't have to accept
that type of treatment. But most of them aren't

497
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:36,089
going to pull the job offer. You can talk
to them. Now, understand, there are likely

498
00:52:36,089 --> 00:52:43,630
things that you can't negotiate. Like if they're
really, really strict on vacation, we have

499
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:49,819
a really strict vacation policy. This is what
it is. We're not able to adjust that. Then

500
00:52:49,819 --> 00:52:55,229
maybe you go after something else. If you're
not happy with the insurance policies that

501
00:52:55,229 --> 00:53:00,879
they have available, probably not a lot they
can do about that. Those get set at a high

502
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,059
corporate level. They get set once a year.
They can't really change those because one

503
00:53:05,059 --> 00:53:08,610
person has an issue.
Now, they might change it over time. Might

504
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:14,589
make an offer to do that. Decide whether that's
of value to you or not. But maybe they can

505
00:53:14,589 --> 00:53:18,190
give you something else instead. My personal
story on this. I went into an organization.

506
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:23,440
I wasn't happy with specific procedures that
their particular insurance policy didn't cover,

507
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:31,609
and they threw a nice big signing bonus at
me. Said, hey, you know what? We realize that.

508
00:53:31,609 --> 00:53:35,529
We're gonna try to fix that insurance. But
in the meantime, we're gonna add on this extra

509
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:41,589
amount to make up for where you might have
medical expenses that might be covered. That

510
00:53:41,589 --> 00:53:48,019
works. That might work for you. That's another
decision making factor. But the point is,

511
00:53:48,019 --> 00:53:54,390
it's a negotiation. Give and take.
You may not get everything that you ask for.

512
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:59,960
But you can get more than what they put in
their initial offer on that letter. So, don't

513
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:10,130
be afraid to ask for it. Go for it. Get paid!
Finally, I'm gonna use that cliche. Maybe

514
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:18,890
you're familiar with it. Rising tides raise
all ships. The closing keynote by Suchi later

515
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:25,839
today, talking about needing the ladders to
lift others up. This is part of building your

516
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:34,430
career as well. Being willing to help others.
To reach out a hand, to help them grow helps

517
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:45,118
you grow. I already mentioned the value that
a mentee can have to the mentor. Helping people

518
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:50,729
raises your spirits, makes you a better person
just in general. Which helps you grow and

519
00:54:50,729 --> 00:54:56,839
do your job. It also other people see that.
And they want to be a part of the good things

520
00:54:56,839 --> 00:54:59,770
that you're doing. And so, it helps you that
way.

521
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:05,960
Now, yes, there are those in our industry
who for some reason believe that the only

522
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:11,971
way to prop up their insecure egos is to try
to hold others down. That doesn't work. We

523
00:55:11,971 --> 00:55:21,900
all sink when we do that. Lift people up.
Help them to grow. Again, check out Suchi's

524
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:29,010
talk later today on this. My personal experience
with this, just happened the other day. You

525
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:33,700
see here on the left a Tweet that I was in
the middle of writing. In fact, this is exactly

526
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:44,439
how my screen looked when FedEx rang my doorbell.
I was in a bad space. I was really feeling

527
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:50,280
awful about myself. A lot of reasons I'm not
gonna get into. It was a vague Tweet. I was

528
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:56,190
vaguebooking, if you will, on purpose. But
I was feeling down, and I needed to express

529
00:55:56,190 --> 00:56:02,279
it. I needed to get it off my chest. And this
is how I was feeling. But before I hit Tweet,

530
00:56:02,279 --> 00:56:07,349
FedEx showed up. I came to my door with a
box. It was a box I wasn't expecting. I had

531
00:56:07,349 --> 00:56:16,539
no shipments that I knew of that were coming.
When I opened up that box, inside were 20

532
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:22,299
hand written and in some cases hand drawn
thank you notes.

533
00:56:22,299 --> 00:56:30,259
These thank you notes came from young middle
school aged girls who were involved in a cybersecurity

534
00:56:30,259 --> 00:56:41,099
camp called CybHER. They were on a team that
the organizers of CybHER asked to name after

535
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:47,150
me. Apparently they picked people from the
cybersecurity community and asked to name

536
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:53,769
the teams after them. I was one of the team
names. It required very little on my part.

537
00:56:53,769 --> 00:57:01,979
I wrote a bio for them that they shared with
the girls on the teams. But just that little

538
00:57:01,979 --> 00:57:11,118
bit resulted in thank you notes who wrote
paragraphs about how inspiring they found

539
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:19,210
my story, or about their passion for technology.
Or hearing my story changed their mind and

540
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:27,410
they really wanted to get into STEM careers.
And suddenly, I was uplifted. I was energized.

541
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:33,058
I wanted to do more. I wanted to go running
right how and just be the best Alyssa I could

542
00:57:33,059 --> 00:57:38,150
be.
Just that little gesture of these thank you

543
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:48,410
notes. These are the kinds of things that
happen to you when you help raise others up.

544
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:53,859
To realize I've had that much impact on others.
What that does for my own self confidence.

545
00:57:53,859 --> 00:58:02,160
20 girls who in some way were impacted by
my life story. Who are more energized to chase

546
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:08,719
their careers and their goals as a result.
So, be willing as your career grows to recognize

547
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:16,600
the value of helping others. Check out that
talk, that closing keynote later today. Learn

548
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:22,569
more about strategies for how to do this and
the effectiveness of it. Learn from the research

549
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:29,630
that she has done. Check that out.
We're getting down to the type to wrap up.

550
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:35,410
But I wanted to leave you with this quote
that I think was apropos to this entire topic.

551
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:43,290
And it comes from our former President. The
real test is not whether you avoid failure.

552
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:47,740
Because you won't. Failures are gonna happen.
You're going to experience them. It's whether

553
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:53,799
you let it harden or shame you into inaction.
Do you let it scare you and keep you from

554
00:58:53,799 --> 00:58:59,788
going for the things you want? Or do you learn
from it? Do you chase that dream? Do you go

555
00:58:59,789 --> 00:59:08,069
after it? Do you make yourself the spark that
ignites the flames of your career? When you

556
00:59:08,069 --> 00:59:16,920
do that, you won't get burned, you can't get
burned. You're the flame that's driving that.

557
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:23,710
Own your career journey. Recognize the wonderful
things that you've done. Look objectively

558
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:29,730
at your accomplishments. Don't minimize 'em.
Understand that everybody experiences imposter

559
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:37,480
syndrome. Understand that everybody has had
lucky breaks. Take advantage of those. And

560
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:44,460
demand better. Get paid for the job that you're
gonna do and negotiate it. Get the money.

561
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:50,890
Apply to that job even if the laundry list
of requirements and responsibilities looks

562
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:55,140
daunting. You can do it. You can get there.
Bring your value and sell yourself.

563
00:59:55,140 --> 01:00:02,049
Now, I encourage you all to reach out and
continue the conversation. I am happy to to

564
01:00:02,050 --> 01:00:07,219
discuss anything, really, with you in terms
of cybersecurity or BBQ, like Nicole mentioned,

565
01:00:07,219 --> 01:00:13,380
whatever. Reach out to me, here's my social
media information. I'm here to be a resource

566
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:25,380
for you. That's what motivates me these days.
And then finally, great big, massive thank

567
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:31,349
you to The Diana Initiative for allowing me
the opportunity to be here with you today.

568
01:00:31,349 --> 01:00:36,880
Huge thank you to S&P Global Ratings. Not
only for the opportunity to have this role.

569
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:41,079
But for the opportunity to be here. If it
wasn't for them, I wouldn't have this story

570
01:00:41,079 --> 01:00:45,239
to share. If it wasn't for them, giving me
the time today to share it with all of you,

571
01:00:45,239 --> 01:00:54,249
I couldn't be here. But most importantly,
thank you. Every single one of you who is

572
01:00:54,249 --> 01:01:00,578
here this morning, who has come here to hear
about this talk, who has come to Diana Initiative

573
01:01:00,579 --> 01:01:12,519
to to learn. To grow. To hear from others.
Coming up next, we have an amazing panel of

574
01:01:12,519 --> 01:01:19,359
cybersecurity leaders in the CISO panel. Stick
around for them. Get out to hallway con and

575
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:26,200
interact with others. Build that network,
grow, learn. You've got a wonderful two day

576
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:33,218
opportunity here. Leverage that. But thank
you again so much for being a part of this

577
01:01:33,219 --> 01:01:39,510
event. I love you all!
NICOLE: And thank you very much. You definitely

578
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:46,520
brought people to tears at the end. If you
check the comments there. And in fact, like,

579
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:51,329
there's a whole bunch of people who now are
like inspired to try for more job positions,

580
01:01:51,329 --> 01:01:57,329
to give a try for negotiating. People were
talking about how they couldn't wait to talk

581
01:01:57,329 --> 01:02:02,650
about parental leave. And how annoying it
is to look for those unicorn job postings.

582
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:10,290
So, yeah. You definitely hit a home run. Thank
you so much. I'm so glad you agreed to open

583
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:14,839
us up.
ALYSSA: Well, thank you. My heart is exploding

584
01:02:14,839 --> 01:02:20,749
right now hearing that. And I'm thrilled.
I can't I can't say enough, again, how much

585
01:02:20,749 --> 01:02:24,089
it meant to me to be able to share this this
year.

586
01:02:24,089 --> 01:02:33,859
NICOLE: So, thank you. And I'm now gonna do
the boring bits. So... all right, folks!

587
01:02:33,859 --> 01:02:39,819
We have a whole bunch of stuff on Hopin that
I'm going to tell you about so you can get

588
01:02:39,819 --> 01:02:46,829
ready for our next item which is the panel
that Alyssa mentioned. I've posted a chat

589
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:54,229
item pinned to the top there that's a survey
for the keynote. So, feel free to take that.

590
01:02:54,229 --> 01:03:00,098
And so, right now you might be using the mobile
app. If you are using a mobile device and

591
01:03:00,099 --> 01:03:04,700
not using a mobile app, please download that.
Things will be arranged slightly differently

592
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:09,718
than in the web browser, but you should still
be able to find all the same items. The reception

593
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:15,240
area has a whole bunch of text. I promise
it's all useful. Give it a good scroll. How

594
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:20,399
to report safety concerns, FAQ, where the
sh-wag story is. And there's the schedule

595
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:26,910
at the bottom. It will take you to the right
place in Hopin. There's four stages, stage

596
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:33,769
1, here. Keynotes happen here. Full day of
talks. And Amanda is providing captioning,

597
01:03:33,769 --> 01:03:42,879
from White Coat Captioning. She's not AI.
The link is below the stage. Corelight paid

598
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:50,079
for it. The others don't have live captions.
But you can use a web tool, web captioner

599
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:57,779
to generate captions. That is AI so it's not
going to be perfect. Stage 4 is the village,

600
01:03:57,779 --> 01:04:03,109
check out the schedule for those that are
going to be occurring. Now in the sessions,

601
01:04:03,109 --> 01:04:07,660
that's where our villages are. This year we
have the information booth. Questions? Head

602
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:12,890
there. They will find you the answer.
Stage 4 is career village. Mock interviews,

603
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:18,799
resume reviews, LinkedIn reviews, impromptu
career advice and chats that just happen.

604
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:24,430
That was really fun last year, everyone enjoyed..
Capture the flag, four separate CTFs and tunes.

605
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:31,828
There's a DJ. Stop in there. Internet of things,
hands on lab. No experience needed. give it

606
01:04:31,829 --> 01:04:37,220
a try. Teen village. If you are a teenager
and you have a teen ticket, go in there. Amazing

607
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:43,529
amounts of talks happening there. I'm kind
of jelly, actually. They're going to get started

608
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:57,239
on their InfoSec. And soldering toys this
year, you can learn about surface mount soldering

609
01:04:57,239 --> 01:05:06,530
and all the cool stuff that happens in there.
We have got Maker Village, meditations, different

610
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:11,969
talks going through the day. Probably some
videos popping in there with some animals.

611
01:05:11,969 --> 01:05:17,190
Might as well swing in if you've got some
time. If you have pre registered for the lock

612
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:23,119
picking workshop, that's going to be in Zoom
and not Hopin. So, look for that in your email

613
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:28,059
boxes.
The little networking icon is a random pairing.

614
01:05:28,059 --> 01:05:33,160
So, you're gonna get to talk to somebody else
for 10 minutes. I may update it to 15, to

615
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:37,210
be determined. This is also where the Saturday
socials are happening. We had one before the

616
01:05:37,210 --> 01:05:42,010
talks and one after the talks to accommodate
all the time zones. Finally, our expo hall

617
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:47,359
has sponsors, community organizations and
not for profits that we love. So, between

618
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:53,319
the talks, like right now, when you've got
some time, make sure you grab some swag, CTF,

619
01:05:53,319 --> 01:06:00,579
raffle items in the expo hall. Go try out
the IoT lab. You could win some raffles all

620
01:06:00,579 --> 01:06:05,940
over the place. And I think there's a whole
bunch of Yubikeys at the Yubikey booth. Check

621
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:10,710
the schedule for when live things are happening.
There's job AMAs at the Google booth. And

622
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:16,369
there's some other like live demos going on
over there.

623
01:06:16,369 --> 01:06:20,480
And finally, on the right hand side, just
note there's two different chats. There's

624
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:24,609
gonna be the event chat which is like the
general room in Slack or the place you land

625
01:06:24,609 --> 01:06:28,808
when you get into Discord. And then there's
the chat that's specific to the stage or the

626
01:06:28,809 --> 01:06:31,980
session. Make sure you're putting it in the
right place, otherwise people might be a little

627
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:37,869
bit confused what you're talking about. And
if you do comment in the correct place, the

628
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:43,589
speakers actually get to see it in the backstage
here. And with that, you've got probably about

629
01:06:43,589 --> 01:06:49,830
20 minutes to go try out the networking tool,
check out the expo hall, or maybe go see who

630
01:06:49,830 --> 01:06:52,180
else is around that you know. Thanks, everyone!
