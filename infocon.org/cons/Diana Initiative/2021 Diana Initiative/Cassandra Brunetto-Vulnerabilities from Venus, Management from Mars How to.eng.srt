00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:20,939
Vulnerabilities from Venus, Management from
Mars: How to Navigate the Unknown

2
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,900
Cassandra Brunetto
CHERYL: Cassie Brunetto is our next speaker,

3
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:32,369
great experience in terms of IT, risk and
compliance and building security programs.

4
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:48,860
She's also the founder of Gatebreachers this
talk is managing success with programs.

5
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,410
And then some question and answer afterwards.

6
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,099
so, please put your questions in the talk.

7
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,710
And a word of praise and thank you to our
very generous sponsors.

8
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,750
Thank you if you've explored the expo hall,
if not, take a few moments to say hi.

9
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:10,250
And without further ado, I will pass this
over to Cassie Brunetto.

10
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,380
CASSIE: Thank you.

11
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,530
My name is Cassie.

12
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:27,370
My talk is Vulnerabilities from Venus, Management
from Mars: How to Navigate the Unknown.

13
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,620
Before I get started, I would like to introduce
myself.

14
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,790
My name is Cassie.

15
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,610
My pronouns are she/her.

16
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:38,860
I'm the ID and compliance manager at Graylog.

17
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:44,479
And dog owner of Astro, the lovely German
shepherd on the right and many of you know

18
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,720
from Twitter.

19
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:53,250
I play a key role in identifying, managing
and monitoring cybersecurity risk within more

20
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,250
organization.

21
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,580
I started in help desk and worked my way up.

22
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:04,658
Got my bachelor's degree in information security
and assurance and got a master's degree in

23
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:08,020
my second position in security.

24
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:20,299
And then in 2019, I founded Gatebreachers,
and we work on inclusivity and look to see

25
00:02:20,299 --> 00:02:23,099
more underrepresented genders in the field.

26
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:30,970
Shoutout to everyone trucking through and
learning more while we have been in a pandemic.

27
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:31,970
You're awesome.

28
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,660
And I got some certifications.

29
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:40,940
Just to learn and, you know, I think that
everyone can learn from them.

30
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,520
And but not required in the field.

31
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,410
So, I have the CISSP, the CISM and the Security+.

32
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:51,260
And you are all joining me for my first GRC
talk.

33
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,850
So, thank you so much for joining me!

34
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:59,709
So, why do we care about building effective
security programs?

35
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:07,239
Well, in 2013 Yahoo! suffered a security breach
affecting 3 billion accounts.

36
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:10,340
They were fined $85 million.

37
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,660
And it took them 3 years to discover and disclose
the breach.

38
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,430
And almost 4 years to complete the investigation.

39
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:25,910
In 2014 Home Depot credentials were stolen
from a third party which led to a compromise

40
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,480
of the point of sale system.

41
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,569
This resulted in a $200 million fine.

42
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:39,958
Threat actors likely completed the initial
breach through a third party supplier workstation.

43
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:46,220
Then they surveilled the cardholder data and
then tested the attack to capture and expirate

44
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,220
data.

45
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:56,550
In 2016, Uber paid the criminal that hacked
its driver and user accounts $100,000 which

46
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:00,459
led to a $148 million fine.

47
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:06,519
The chief security officer and one of his
deputies were fired for their roles in concealing

48
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:10,670
the attack.

49
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:17,978
In 2017, Equifax lost personal and financial
information of 150 million clients due to

50
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:25,090
an unpatched database framework resulting
in a $575 million fine.

51
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:30,349
Threat actors were able to move from a consumer
complaint portal to other servers because

52
00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:33,010
they weren't segmented from each other.

53
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:39,390
And they had usernames and passwords stored
in plaintext.

54
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:46,500
This year in 2021 the Colonial Pipeline proactively
shut down its operations after a ransomware

55
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,440
attack, resulting in fuel shortages along
the East Coast.

56
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:57,290
The company believes that attackers exploited
a legacy virtual private network profile that

57
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:01,690
did not have multifactor authentication configured.

58
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:07,370
The Colonial Pipeline also paid a $5 million
ransom to the Russian base criminal group,

59
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,370
Dark Side.

60
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:15,830
As you can see, it's extremely important to
build a program to protect, prevent, respond

61
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,750
and recover from cybersecurity incidents.

62
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:27,000
So, you have been hired to manage the information
security program at a new company.

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,790
How do you build a security strategy without
becoming overwhelmed?

64
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:36,190
How do you define the scope for security initiatives?

65
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:40,230
Before we can create a security roadmap or
strategy, we need to thoroughly understand

66
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:45,500
the basics, so we'll want to talk to employees
and discover more about the new company and

67
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,210
its culture.

68
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,638
What does the company do?

69
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,810
You want to talk with senior management about
the current state of the organization.

70
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,520
What product or service is being provided?

71
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,010
What kind of data is being accessed, processed,
transmitted or stored?

72
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:14,259
Do you have any information security or regulatory
requirements that have to be met?

73
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:17,180
What are the company's current initiatives?

74
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,949
Is there a new functionality or service being
implemented into a product?

75
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:27,240
Does the organization plan on hiring new employees
or building new teams?

76
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,800
And what are the company's goals for the future?

77
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,400
You also want to consider scalability and
cost efficiency when architecting security

78
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,840
processes and controls.

79
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,349
Next you want to understand the company culture.

80
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,580
Is this currently a managed security program?

81
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:53,909
You'll want to review policies, procedures,
guidelines and standards.

82
00:06:53,910 --> 00:07:00,840
You can also interview employees about currently
implemented security practices.

83
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:08,030
And is there any framework that the security
program is already aligned with such as national

84
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:15,840
information, NIST cybersecurity framework?

85
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,830
And how do employees feel about the security
controls in place or the lack thereof?

86
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,859
Are security controls hindering operational
effectiveness?

87
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:31,199
Are the security controls aligned with the
mission and vision of what the organization?

88
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,760
Are the security controls actually meeting
their objectives?

89
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,860
Is there a security awareness training program?

90
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,990
What type of security awareness training program
is provided?

91
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,960
Is training tailored to the organization and
its employees?

92
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,919
And are metrics being used to measure the
effectiveness of security awareness training

93
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:52,049
program?

94
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:58,449
Finally, are there documented security policies
and are they disseminated to employees?

95
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:02,639
Are new or updated policies communicated to
employees?

96
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,930
Is there a central repository where employees
can review relevant policies?

97
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:16,260
And how often are employees required to review
these policies?

98
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:21,610
You'll also want to understand the data classification
scheme being used, if there is one.

99
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:26,349
So, we want to ask ourselves, is data being
classified currently?

100
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:31,710
If so, what are the data classifications currently
being used?

101
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,860
Is there a standardized classification?

102
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,419
Are the data classifications clearly defined?

103
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:44,179
Ideally, there should be an easily accessible
data classification policy or standard that

104
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:48,849
defines data classifications and provides
clear examples.

105
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:55,379
Next, you want to identify the crown jewels.

106
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:57,230
What are the crown jewels?

107
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:02,250
What does the company consider important to
its mission, objectives and operations?

108
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:09,670
The crown jewels can be source code, intellectual
property, personally identifiable information,

109
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:14,360
personal health information, and other proprietary
data.

110
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,819
Who owns the crown jewels?

111
00:09:16,819 --> 00:09:23,410
Who is accountable for the confidentiality,
integrity and availability of the crown jewels?

112
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:27,839
You'll want to interview senior management
and other business unit managers to identify

113
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,970
the information owners.

114
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:35,999
Then you want to understand where the crown
jewels are located.

115
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:40,329
Where the crown jewels being accessed, processed
and stored?

116
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:44,670
You'll want to identify any applications,
systems, and services.

117
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:52,860
This information can be extremely helpful
when you're creating data flow diagrams.

118
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,209
Next you'll want to understand how the crown
jewels are being accessed.

119
00:09:57,209 --> 00:09:59,800
How can I access the crown jewels?

120
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,719
Is there multifactor authentication required?

121
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,679
Are there shared accounts?

122
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:09,180
Which brings us to who has access to the crown
jewels?

123
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:14,649
Who are the people responsible for using the
crown jewels during their everyday tasks?

124
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:20,500
It could be developers, engineers, sales,
or marketing teams.

125
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,800
And finally, who needs access to the crown
jewels?

126
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,029
We want to make sure that we're removing any
unnecessary access.

127
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:34,629
We want to also ensure that we're provisioning
access according to the principle of least

128
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:39,490
privilege and ensuring that we are reviewing
all privileged access.

129
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:43,699
We have to remove any accounts or any access.

130
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:49,639
This could include service accounts and any
type of things that are standardly configured

131
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:52,980
in Active Directory.

132
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,809
You'll also want to take an inventory of the
infrastructure.

133
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:00,649
What does the infrastructure look like?

134
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:04,970
Is there a network flow diagram or a data
flow diagram?

135
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,829
Are we using Linux or Windows on servers?

136
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:13,089
Are we using a cloud hosting providers in
are we using containerization or a container

137
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:17,319
orchestration technology such as Kubernetes?

138
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:23,049
Then we want to understand the technology
stacking with used for product services offered.

139
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,309
Apache?

140
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,569
MySQL?

141
00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:26,809
Elastic search.

142
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:35,269
And then who is managing the infrastructure?

143
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:36,889
Is there an engineering team?

144
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:40,549
Is there an operations team or is it information
technology?

145
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:50,560
We can also interview any employees about
the current practices and processes.

146
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,508
Third party vendor risk management.

147
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:59,180
Is there actually a managed third party vendor
risk management program?

148
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:03,969
If yes, are there any established practices
or procedures?

149
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:07,860
Any templates or questionnaires that are currently
being used?

150
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,769
Or are we going to build program from scratch?

151
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:16,589
If so, we want to consider the third party
vendor life cycle and the processes that we're

152
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:21,100
going to develop to onboard and off board
vendors.

153
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,959
Who are the high and critical vendors?

154
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:25,670
Have they been assessed?

155
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:30,479
How frequently will high and critical vendors
be assessed in the future?

156
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:37,980
And is the right and ability to audit controls
currently included in any vendor contracts?

157
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,610
Which vendors are being assessed?

158
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:46,059
You want to create an inventory of third party
vendors, document the services that are being

159
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:52,079
provided, the business unit being serviced
and any third party vendor contacts.

160
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,199
You'll also want to determine the assessment
requirements for third party vendors.

161
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:06,709
For example, cloud hosting providers must
provide type 2 reports.

162
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:10,069
Who are the organization's key players?

163
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:13,779
It's important to identify the owner of risks.

164
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:15,139
Who are the risk owners?

165
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:17,399
Is it the chief technology officer?

166
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:20,199
The Vice President of a business line?

167
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:26,040
It's important to establish and document any
type of risk ownership.

168
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,639
Next you'll want to identify key players.

169
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,249
Who are the information security program's
stakeholders?

170
00:13:31,249 --> 00:13:37,499
It could be the marketing, sales, or engineering
departments.

171
00:13:37,499 --> 00:13:40,749
Who are the subject matter experts?

172
00:13:40,749 --> 00:13:46,420
You'll want to identify information technology
and information security subject matter experts

173
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,069
throughout the organization.

174
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:53,360
And keep in mind, they might not necessarily
work in the security department.

175
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,779
There may be employees in other departments
that have security knowledge.

176
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:01,139
Who do other employees trust?

177
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:05,899
Is there somebody that can assist you with
implementing security initiatives that other

178
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:07,930
employees trust?

179
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,219
You'll want to build relationships with these
key players.

180
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:16,160
It is crucial to build relationships with
the key players in your organization to gain

181
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,110
trust and credibility with other employees.

182
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:24,790
Key player are the vehicle that will drive
your security program.

183
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:29,879
They will have insight and tribal knowledge
that will be overlooked if you try to establish

184
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:35,120
processes on your own and it's integral to
include them in important conservations and

185
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,869
discussions.

186
00:14:37,869 --> 00:14:43,709
Defining the scope of your security program.

187
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:47,149
First, you'll want to identify gaps.

188
00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:51,250
What is the current state versus what is the
desired state?

189
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:58,309
You can use the NIST National Institute of
Technology Strategies of framework implementation

190
00:14:58,309 --> 00:14:59,600
tiers.

191
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,839
There are three tiers.

192
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,069
Partial, risk informed and repeatable.

193
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:10,139
So, for example, your current tier might be
risk informed and your desired state would

194
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,410
be repeatable.

195
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,809
Then you'll want to identify risks.

196
00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:19,180
You can use threat modeling and perform a
risk assessment.

197
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:23,399
Then you want to consider the risks presented
by identified gaps.

198
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:29,589
Does the risk of an ineffective security control
surpass the organization's risk appetite?

199
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:32,609
Then you'll want to prioritize these risks.

200
00:15:32,609 --> 00:15:37,069
What risks need to be mitigated based on the
identified impacts?

201
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:45,929
We want to mitigate the risk with the greatest
adverse impact and the likelihood of occurrence.

202
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:50,639
It's important to develop realistic security
program goals and I'm going provide you with

203
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:57,249
some advice that I wish I had when I first
started creating security risk and roadmaps.

204
00:15:57,249 --> 00:16:02,239
First off, set yourself up for success.

205
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:09,609
Develop SM ART which stands for specific,
measurable, attainable, relevant, time based

206
00:16:09,609 --> 00:16:15,489
goals for performance and project management.

207
00:16:15,489 --> 00:16:19,059
Your goals should align with the mission of
the organization.

208
00:16:19,059 --> 00:16:25,209
For example, one of your goals could be to
decrease security risk by developing a vulnerability

209
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:27,449
and patch management process.

210
00:16:27,449 --> 00:16:33,160
Or increase security awareness by providing
interactive security training to employees

211
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,478
on a periodic basis.

212
00:16:36,479 --> 00:16:38,350
Don't be too ambitious.

213
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:43,519
There may be dozens of fires to put out, but
you only have so much time and energy.

214
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:50,729
You'll want to prioritize critical and high
risks and develop a project plan.

215
00:16:50,729 --> 00:16:55,040
Do not be a jack of all trades and a master
of none.

216
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:01,529
There may be many opportunities for improvement
in areas such as network security, application

217
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:07,329
security, logical access security, or third
party vender risk management.

218
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:13,930
But you should target significant gaps that
have been identified during the scoping phase.

219
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,699
Focus on one area and be exceptional.

220
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:20,449
Improve one area with significant gaps.

221
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:25,579
For example, if you don't currently have an
identity and access management program, one

222
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:31,509
of your initiatives can be focusing on standardizing
roles and access and then integrating single

223
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:36,669
sign on or multifactor authentication with
critical applications and privileged user

224
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:39,669
accounts.

225
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:43,139
Communicate your boundaries with your manager
and other teams.

226
00:17:43,139 --> 00:17:47,939
Don't be afraid to say no just because you
think you'll disappoint your manager or your

227
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,070
team.

228
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:54,269
You want to define you and/or your security
team's job scope.

229
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:59,610
And establish open lines of communication
between other teams and the information security

230
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,110
department.

231
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:06,290
Do not take on an overwhelming amount of projects.

232
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:11,408
Avoid burnout and avoid stress by managing
less projects.

233
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:13,800
Create a project plan including a timeline.

234
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,470
You can create a Gantt chart or use free online
tools.

235
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,889
And consider using other resources.

236
00:18:19,889 --> 00:18:23,050
This brings us to leveraging third parties.

237
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:29,029
You can hire third parties for larger projects
like incident response or disaster recovery

238
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:30,860
capabilities.

239
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,570
Third parties can also help you build and
house teams.

240
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:40,408
Third parties can be more cost efficient than
building capabilities in house.

241
00:18:40,409 --> 00:18:45,320
You can also consider hiring consultants for
short term projects like creating policies

242
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,260
or hiring employees.

243
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:54,419
Consider outsourcing short term projects that
require experienced subject matter experts.

244
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:59,240
Consultants can also be more efficient than
hiring full time employees.

245
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:05,809
Last but not least, make incremental changes
throughout time instead of attempting to remediate

246
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:08,700
all gaps within a short amount of time.

247
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,570
Patience is key.

248
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:17,020
It takes time to implement processes, change
or build a security culture, and create key

249
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,129
performance or risk indicators.

250
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:26,620
But you want to make sure that you're documenting,
tracking, and measuring and reporting all

251
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,059
of your progress.

252
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:33,740
You can easily show your impact on the organization's
security posture.

253
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,340
Don't forget to celebrate small wins.

254
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,990
It's like a 10 mile hike.

255
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:42,269
Don't focus on getting all the way to the
top of the mountain.

256
00:19:42,269 --> 00:19:48,970
Be enthusiastic about reaching small milestones
throughout your journey.

257
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:55,010
Well, that was my talk on starting a security
program.

258
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,840
I can be reached on Twitter.

259
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,139
My handle is loquaciousloka and I'm on LinkedIn.

260
00:20:01,139 --> 00:20:07,500
I have included in my slides the implementation
tiers.

261
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,299
So, feel free to take a look at that once
I have shared my slides.

262
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:13,250
Thank you!

263
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,200
CHERYL: Congratulations!

264
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,950
That was a great talk.

265
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,960
I like how you walked us through the steps.

266
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,890
But you just really simplified, but called
out the important things.

267
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:30,279
We have some good questions from people in
the chat.

268
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:32,940
I'll start with the first one.

269
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,710
This is from Duane Dunston, and he wanted
to know how many organizations you have consulted

270
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:43,260
with that identified the crown jewels and
now where they were located?

271
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:50,279
CASSIE: I would say that the amount of organizations
that had that before I was there would probably

272
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:51,740
be zero.

273
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,320
Maybe one in the financial industry.

274
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:00,860
But I would say that this is a process that
not many people do, in my opinion.

275
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:09,370
And creating an asset management program or
inventory or configuration database is like

276
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,668
something that's I've rarely seen.

277
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:17,970
So, getting this, you know, obviously you
build upon asset management into vulnerability

278
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:18,970
management and patch management.

279
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:24,460
So, it's really important to know what you
have before you can protect it, of course.

280
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,520
CHERYL: Absolutely.

281
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,100
We have another question.

282
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:35,320
This is from a volunteer, and he wanted to
know, how do we make some of this work in

283
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,149
a small business environment?

284
00:21:37,149 --> 00:21:40,158
CASSIE: A small business environment.

285
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:45,600
I would definitely recommend thoroughly doing
your research.

286
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,928
Your due diligence.

287
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:54,290
And preparing any type of evidence that you
can provide to whoever writes the checks.

288
00:21:54,290 --> 00:22:00,940
And just really getting intimate with your
fellow coworkers and you're gonna be building

289
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,440
relationships and having to work with them.

290
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,700
And just really understanding what role everyone
plays in the organization.

291
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:14,509
And architecting security controls that make
sense financially.

292
00:22:14,509 --> 00:22:19,410
That play nice with any type of legacy technology.

293
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:23,320
All of these factors you really have to take
into consideration.

294
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:28,700
But I would definitely put an emphasis on
the cost benefit analysis because small SMBs

295
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:35,460
are gonna want to go with the least costly
controls or processes to implement.

296
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:41,760
So, you want to make sure that you have, you
know, evidence and proof of a benefit and

297
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,399
return on investment.

298
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:44,969
CHERYL: Great point.

299
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:50,549
I love that you highlighted the importance
of knowing who does what, so you know whom

300
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:52,120
to ask when things come up.

301
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:57,189
As sort of a not what you know, but who you
know approach to things.

302
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,419
CASSIE: For sure.

303
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:05,309
CHERYL: We've also got a fabulous question
from Edmund here.

304
00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:10,809
What's the strangest thing you have discovered
on a network during an asset inventory?

305
00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:15,500
CASSIE: Totally Windows XP.

306
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,740
Default admin privileges.

307
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:23,120
Just really just scary, scary things like
that.

308
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:28,178
And seeing people that use privileged user
accounts all day for like their daily tasks

309
00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:31,200
I think has been like one of my nightmares
of my life.

310
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,580
So, please don't do that!

311
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,769
CHERYL: Oh, real stories.

312
00:23:36,769 --> 00:23:39,309
I'll see if there's anything else.

313
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:45,269
No, I think that we are good for questions
here in the chat.

314
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:47,740
And again, you're gonna make your slides available.

315
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:52,860
We've got the links to the NIST framework
which is a very helpful tool, and you want

316
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:57,610
to have that to work alongside, and this was
a terrific presentation.

317
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:58,779
CASSIE: Thank you very much.

318
00:23:58,779 --> 00:24:00,139
It was a pleasure to meet you.

319
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:01,428
Thank you for having me.

320
00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:04,590
CHERYL: Thank you for being part of Diana
Initiative 2021.

321
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,970
Thank you everyone for attending.

322
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:07,970
CASSIE: Bye!

323
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:08,869
CHERYL: Bye!
