1
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,799
hello and welcome to day two at diane

2
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,239
initiative

3
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,680
just as a reminder there are a lot of

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,119
things going on in addition to our

5
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,279
amazing talks please be sure to visit

6
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,680
the villages and check out the expo

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,599
center where our sponsors are and some

8
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,359
of them are giving out great prizes so

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,199
at the very least say hello thank them

10
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,640
for sponsoring and maybe you can win

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,840
something cool

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,000
um talking about awesomeness i'm super

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,239
excited to welcome wendy edwards of the

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,800
stage everybody please help me welcoming

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,680
her wendy's talk is what machine

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,879
learning can and can't do for security

17
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,200
take it away wendy

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,200
thank you so much

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,239
um

20
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,160
so we're going to start with an exciting

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,640
slide from our sponsors

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,600
um

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,879
basically

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,239
thank you so much to all these

25
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,079
organizations for financially supporting

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,840
diana it's

27
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,440
i mean it's a great conference and it's

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,879
very nice we can all have affordable

29
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,560
tickets

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,720
so anyhow the

31
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,479
so my talk the name of my talk is what

32
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,320
machine learning can and can't do for

33
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,960
security

34
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,040
so just a let's start with a brief

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,759
interruption introduction um i'm from

36
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,680
urbana illinois i don't know how many of

37
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,280
you have heard of urbana

38
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,200
probably not a lot of you

39
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,439
but basically about 200 kilometers or

40
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,200
maybe 130 miles south of chicago

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,840
and so i work as a software developer um

42
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,799
at a nonprofit called aspca

43
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,400
and i'm a nasa data knot and i

44
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,560
was able to participate in the 2017

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,159
sands women's academy which is a great

46
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,439
experience

47
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,320
i'm

48
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,200
wayward 710 on twitter and my

49
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,560
pronouns are she and her

50
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,360
okay so let's just a brief

51
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,200
uh agree it's a brief discussion what

52
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,079
we'll talk about we're just going to

53
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,680
talk about terminology and concepts

54
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,200
because i know you hear

55
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,799
a lot of people talk about all these

56
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,479
things um

57
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,920
i mean like for example when you go to a

58
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,679
swag hall how many people are talking

59
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,239
about machine learning

60
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,360
um probably a lot right

61
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,879
and so do you want to listen to them

62
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,800
well yeah if they've got good swag

63
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,360
definitely

64
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,040
and we'll talk about some examples and

65
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,160
then we'll also talk about some

66
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,160
limitations and risks of machine

67
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,720
security

68
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,519
let's start start with first so you so

69
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,440
probably a lot of you've heard about

70
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,920
artificial intelligence machine learning

71
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,840
uh and deep learning

72
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,760
and they're kind of they're all uh

73
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,120
so essentially they're they are kind of

74
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,640
like a bunch of uh russian dolls so

75
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,120
basically ai contains all of them and

76
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,120
then machine learning is a such of ai

77
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,040
and then deep learning is a subset of

78
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,760
machine learning

79
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,080
so just starting with some

80
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,760
so artificial intelligence is really

81
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,680
kind of the catch-all it's

82
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,080
it's basically so it encompasses a lot

83
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,040
of things and it's essentially um

84
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,720
talks about computers trying to mimic

85
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,920
human level intelligence

86
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,640
michelle machine learning gets a little

87
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,720
bit more specific there machine learning

88
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,480
is essentially a lot of math they're

89
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,480
using a lot of um

90
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,599
algorithms

91
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,519
and statistics uh that we're going to

92
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,959
get into

93
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,159
um

94
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,519
and there's there are a couple of there

95
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,920
are a couple of ma of uh types of

96
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,000
machine learning called supervised and

97
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,400
unsupervised

98
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,560
um

99
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,200
so uh supervised is basically based on

100
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,599
prior probability is supervised very

101
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,599
often um you need data with the right

102
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,200
answers um

103
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,519
um and so it's knowledge discovery using

104
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,360
probabilities of previously observed

105
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,000
events to infer the probabilities of new

106
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,159
of new events and then unsupervised

107
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,360
learning

108
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,879
basically um

109
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,239
you get to work you are working with

110
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,760
unlabeled data sets which could be a

111
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,480
whole lot easier to to come up with

112
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,319
and so you're so unsupervised learning

113
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,159
you're drawing abstractions from

114
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,920
unlabeled data sets and applying those

115
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,238
to new data

116
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,358
let's talk about what deep learning

117
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,519
so actually so a neural network it's not

118
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,279
really a new idea at all it was invented

119
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,280
in 1942

120
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,880
so there so we're gonna we're actually

121
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,479
gonna look at some pictures and videos

122
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,400
of what a neural network is so don't be

123
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,400
too intimidated by this

124
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,880
uh you're talking about basically these

125
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,800
multi layers of neurons um and they're

126
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,040
made and so

127
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,720
um

128
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,919
so and then each layer is made of a node

129
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,000
and um essentially and so essentially

130
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,400
with a neural network it tries to

131
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,639
to to determine how much weight to give

132
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,400
each of those nodes

133
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,440
and we're going to go ahead we're going

134
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,520
to actually see uh some images of what a

135
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,360
neural network looks like

136
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,600
and then here's to here is just a

137
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,040
image of what a neural network looks

138
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,960
like so you've got your input layer in

139
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,800
this one you have only one hidden layer

140
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,720
but with the neural networks um you can

141
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,759
have

142
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,759
more than one hidden layers as well and

143
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,800
then you have your output layer

144
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,039
that's a picture it would look at the

145
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,400
tensorflow

146
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,120
you can see you can so we can actually

147
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,960
see what it's doing

148
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,479
so are you are you guys able to pretty

149
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,560
much see it

150
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,680
um

151
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,520
so so you can actually see we're using

152
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,840
we're basically using two two features

153
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,160
um so features are basically things that

154
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,600
you're looking for for an input we've

155
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,639
got

156
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,759
um

157
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,919
one hidden layer um

158
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,680
we've got we've got uh two different

159
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,479
layers and we've got our output layer

160
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,880
so like as you as you can see this

161
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,800
this got a pretty good result it was

162
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,960
able to classify them it was not real

163
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,960
fast

164
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,080
okay so so a lot of times when you're on

165
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,039
that you want to tweak the parameters

166
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,960
and that kind of means that like for

167
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,479
example your number of neurons and your

168
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,919
number of layers and stuff you can tweak

169
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,880
them and also you can tweak your inputs

170
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,440
so let's say we're going to go ahead and

171
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,280
try it with

172
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,960
more more input features

173
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,919
and let's just watch how it runs

174
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,120
so you can see since we basically

175
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,720
tweaked it we added more features and

176
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,720
stuff and ran faster

177
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,880
and um that's just that's a little bit

178
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,039
how a little bit how neural networks

179
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,639
work so it's not necessarily like their

180
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,160
magic it's like you're tweaking the

181
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,280
parameters

182
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,000
and so i don't know um

183
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,440
um if

184
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,960
uh look we'll just look at some more

185
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,680
examples some other examples

186
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,720
you can kind of see from the lines and

187
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,680
stuff which which layers um which which

188
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,599
layers which input gets get most heavily

189
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,599
weighted

190
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,479
and so this is a deep learning

191
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,639
so deep learning is also a name we we

192
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,599
use them for stacked neural networks so

193
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,880
we've got a network composed of several

194
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,199
layers and so some of the challenges are

195
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,280
big data a lot of times deep learning

196
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,520
you have a whole lot of data

197
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,919
and so and um

198
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,919
so what's one thing that's commonly used

199
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,879
with ai is gpu processing uh which is

200
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,400
kind of a common thing in super

201
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,000
computing um and these are this is

202
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,560
graphical processing units

203
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,800
um

204
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,000
so with the

205
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
so for example with a

206
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,599
uh supervised learning you need an

207
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,440
extensively labeled data set which could

208
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,560
be uh in itself a very big challenge um

209
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,520
there

210
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,520
so deep learning is not just security it

211
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,440
could be uh applied to computer vision

212
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,199
speech recognition natural language

213
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,800
processing

214
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,280
social networking filters uh

215
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,000
even uh drug design and image and image

216
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,639
analysis

217
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,799
so just as far as how you prepare the

218
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,120
data

219
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,679
um first is first you do you decide

220
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,440
you're going to get you're going to get

221
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,519
your data selected in samples um

222
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,120
so for example you decide which data

223
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,480
elements within our samples should be

224
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,320
extracted and subjected to analysis so

225
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,920
in machine learning we call these data

226
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,440
elements features

227
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,800
so essentially it was kind of like the

228
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,240
previous slides um we were looking at we

229
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,560
um we were picking which features went

230
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,320
into the neural network

231
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,480
and essentially so feature is just what

232
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,519
part of the data are you looking at

233
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,279
um

234
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,160
so yeah and typically um

235
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,160
machine learning algorithms require data

236
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,600
to be encoded in some kind of

237
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,959
mathematical fact

238
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,600
some kind of mathematical function

239
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,640
another thing

240
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,760
another thing we think about is

241
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,760
normalization um

242
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,279
so for example you're basically

243
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,880
transforming your values to a to a uh

244
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,920
range between zero and one

245
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,600
um

246
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,680
i don't know so so for my little uh so

247
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,560
for my little uh picture i took a

248
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,800
this is actually the town of normal we

249
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,480
illinois literally has a town called

250
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,000
normal

251
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,519
uh which is about

252
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,360
maybe 50 miles away from me so i'm

253
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,320
pretty far from normal

254
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,240
and here's here is just an example

255
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,000
here's just an example of normalization

256
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,160
like for example you're uh looking at

257
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,480
your uh request percent per second and

258
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,200
your cpu normalization and you're just

259
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,480
trans and you're basically just

260
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,320
transforming these two values between

261
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,959
zero and one and this is just uh one and

262
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,120
this is just part of the this is just uh

263
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,720
some of the things you have to do to uh

264
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,800
process values for um deep learning

265
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,440
so with pattern pattern recognition this

266
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,800
is actually really important in security

267
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,240
you're trying to discover explicit or

268
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,600
latent characteristics hidden in the

269
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,839
data

270
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,320
um and so so um

271
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,079
so for example like what well like once

272
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,680
you see these uh characteristics it's

273
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,519
like you can say well so what else in

274
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,480
the data might have these

275
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,640
characteristics

276
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,160
and that's very useful security it's

277
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,360
like you can detect um it's i like spam

278
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,040
detection is one of the

279
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,680
uh oldest and most common applications

280
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,000
of machine learning and security um

281
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,360
botnets tends to have like these

282
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,720
distinctive patterns of traffic um so

283
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,959
you have to detect um botnets and then

284
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,040
they're also when you analyze malware

285
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,040
there are also some like characteristics

286
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,839
show up again and again

287
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,640
so what is so there are a couple of

288
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,560
things we do in a couple of things we do

289
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,240
in machine learning um

290
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,760
called clustering and classification

291
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,959
we'll talk about right now about what

292
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,640
cluster is

293
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,680
so clustering it's pretty intuitive um

294
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,560
like like for example um you're trying

295
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,320
to gather things and so with security

296
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,279
the idea really is that uh bad things

297
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,000
happen together

298
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,959
and like uh

299
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,519
like for example like like an attack or

300
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,120
like for example we're gonna have an

301
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,720
example later when they talk about uh

302
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,079
incidents

303
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,200
where um

304
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,040
incident like we're

305
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,120
where that where um

306
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,800
incidents are kind of clustered together

307
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,839
into

308
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,079
and that helps the soc automate their

309
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,240
workload a bit

310
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,880
um there are a variety of there are a

311
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,880
number of techniques um k-means and db

312
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,560
scan are like a couple of most common um

313
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,760
uh dbscan basically does not require you

314
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,120
to start with a defined number of

315
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,880
clusters uh k-means does

316
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,320
and we're going to look at an example

317
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,920
that we're just going to look at this

318
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,279
example like where they started where

319
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,959
they

320
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,760
try to cluster it cluster incidents uh

321
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,240
for security opera for security uh

322
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,399
operation centers

323
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,120
so um

324
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,880
essentially let's start let's start this

325
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,399
so with

326
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,560
hierarchical clustering they kind of

327
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,160
discovered new

328
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,680
similar new incidents and tried to act

329
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,600
on them together and they're trying to

330
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,320
associate new incidents with similar uh

331
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,680
reviewed ones and figure out how they

332
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,040
were handled in the past and that just

333
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,000
saves a lot of soc analyst time because

334
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
uh soc people get to do a lot of tedious

335
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,079
crap they spend a fair amount of time

336
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,079
triaging

337
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,880
and here's a graph so with this

338
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,639
so one of the things they did was they

339
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,560
took um these events that were coming

340
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,800
from a number of different sources

341
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
and basically tried to arrange them

342
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,160
together to

343
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,200
uh

344
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,320
to a

345
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,560
quarter to correspond to collect

346
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,000
collecting incidents and then they group

347
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,079
them together into incidents so they put

348
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,160
stuff from different courses of input

349
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,600
into the same instead of the same

350
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,600
incident

351
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,680
so like an incident was basically is

352
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,360
defined as a collective incident a

353
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,560
collection of events happening in the

354
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,199
same machine and around the same time

355
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,600
and so a lot of times they have the same

356
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,560
the same root cause um so what they what

357
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,320
they did was that they were able to find

358
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,079
to say well this is happening on this

359
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,440
one machine this is happening on this

360
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,800
one machine

361
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,480
um and they they're able to identify

362
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,160
similar clusters going on in another

363
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,519
machine

364
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,720
and

365
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,399
uh they this was this was actually this

366
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,079
actually became part of splunk and they

367
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,279
were and so they were able to just

368
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,320
collect

369
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,720
information about uh what this incident

370
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,360
was and how it was handled and they were

371
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,040
able to just apply that to stuff going

372
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,399
on in other machines and they saved a

373
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,959
whole lot of s of time in this hawk

374
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,000
sock analyst time

375
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,079
here's another example of clustering

376
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,760
so in this case they're actually they're

377
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,680
actually looking at they're actually

378
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,480
going to take a look at pcaps which are

379
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,279
uh packet capture files

380
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,920
to try to try to see to try to look at

381
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,440
for malicious networking flow there

382
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,600
so what they did was they they took a

383
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,760
whole bunch of pcaps that their product

384
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,279
friend michael had already tagged as

385
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,560
malicious

386
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,800
um so so a lot of times um in your

387
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,199
headers uh you're going to see some kind

388
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,199
of non-standard and unusual throw in the

389
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,360
unusual thing kind of in your uh headers

390
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,959
and and uh

391
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,279
payloads with malicious stuff

392
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,040
and they were able they were able to

393
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,160
actually

394
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,480
take these p caps and successfully

395
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,560
cluster them into different kinds of

396
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,760
malicious network flow

397
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,920
so here's your clustering takeaway um

398
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,680
so and clustering is a very general

399
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,839
thing it's i mean it's very it's very

400
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,959
useful for security but um it's used in

401
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,800
a whole lot of discipline

402
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,480
a whole lot of disciplines um the

403
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,399
results

404
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,320
need to the uh results often like

405
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,079
ideally you're going to want them to be

406
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,759
a statistically

407
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,839
statistically valid very carefully

408
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,560
evaluated

409
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,920
and um

410
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,199
one thing that's one thing that's very

411
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,800
useful like as we saw with the sock

412
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,399
thing is that

413
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,279
a lot of times you you have a very large

414
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,519
amounts of data that are that would be

415
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,240
very timeless for for humans to uh sift

416
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,759
through and so these clustering

417
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,160
algorithms are very useful for uh

418
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,800
sifting through those

419
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,199
so classification is a little bit

420
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,440
different um

421
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,199
classification classification is that

422
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,800
you have a predefined class and you're

423
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,399
trying to figure out whether your sample

424
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,800
belongs to that predefined class

425
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,720
and so classified classification

426
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,519
is

427
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,240
example of supervised learning and so

428
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,759
the thing about supervised learning is

429
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,279
that you're building a model you you

430
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,040
basically already know what the right

431
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,000
answers are supposed to be

432
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,560
like um for example and a sample can

433
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,639
also and just saying a sample can also

434
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,279
belong in to multiple classes at the

435
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,759
same time

436
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,560
um like for example as a practical real

437
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,480
world example of uh classification we

438
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,880
might want to classify like like for

439
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,839
example like your email filter um

440
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,120
do is the email benign is it spam or is

441
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,800
it phishing

442
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,680
that's

443
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,680
that's a very useful

444
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,360
that's a that's a very good use for

445
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,839
classification

446
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,880
and so here are some other examples you

447
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,280
could do with classification um

448
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,679
so like button and command and controls

449
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,280
usually have fairly

450
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,119
fairly uh distinctive patterns of

451
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,799
traffic because because like they have

452
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,480
to kind of they kind of have to re they

453
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,000
have to kind of phone home and

454
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,679
communicate with whoever is controlling

455
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,760
them

456
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,400
and they very often use http requests

457
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,320
and so and um

458
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,799
so they so one studies they did and they

459
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,720
basically did a uh

460
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,039
create they

461
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,880
sorry one study they created a decision

462
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,720
tree model using

463
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,440
i'm using a g using a

464
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,919
impurity measures

465
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,320
try to try to uh

466
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,639
oh sorry

467
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,320
so essentially so essentially in another

468
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,960
another um study they created a decision

469
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,520
tree and were able to successfully um

470
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,400
label nodes as botnets or benign based

471
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,679
on analyzing http traffic

472
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,799
so classification takeaway so

473
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,559
classification is a supervised learning

474
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,360
model it works pretty well when you have

475
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,559
enough

476
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,480
accurately labeled data

477
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,840
but that in itself could be kind of a

478
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,600
challenge because it's like who's going

479
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,880
to come up with all the accurate

480
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,280
accurately labeled data that

481
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,960
that becomes a big

482
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,360
a big challenge um

483
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,840
so very often with a classification um

484
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,400
you you separate your data into training

485
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,520
and testing data so you need to

486
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,960
train it you make make sure that your

487
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,280
training data is correct and then you

488
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,720
then you plug in your testing data and

489
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,799
see if that's works and then if if it

490
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,480
works

491
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,960
and then if if it works then you deploy

492
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,039
it

493
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,280
um one thing one thing about

494
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,440
classification is that it's not an

495
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,960
absolute or uh it's not an absolute yes

496
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,960
or no it's saying so what is the

497
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,520
probability that a new unlabeled sample

498
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,240
belongs to a class so it's uh so you

499
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,000
have to maybe decide what your

500
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,799
thresholds are

501
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,160
like what your thresholds are what's

502
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,360
your minimum probability you're

503
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,840
comfortable with

504
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,840
so here's another example of this was

505
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,840
microsoft research

506
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,000
they were using so i know if you're

507
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,679
familiar with malicious powershell

508
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,760
scripts they're very often

509
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,840
like very often a malicious powershell

510
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,360
scripts are kind of obfuscated

511
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,440
it um

512
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,440
kind of deliberately

513
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,600
and so um

514
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,520
so essentially what microsoft decided to

515
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,840
do was rather than trying to manually

516
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,840
figure out what exactly these powershell

517
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,360
meant they decided to just try to figure

518
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,880
out whether these powershell scripts

519
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,840
were malicious or not

520
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,000
um

521
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,679
so they actually they use this technique

522
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,440
called contextual embedding

523
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,720
they use something called the word to

524
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,640
back algorithm

525
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,919
and they extracted tokens from

526
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,039
so so they had a uh large training set

527
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,120
of uh powershell scripts that they had

528
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,960
already determined whether they were

529
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,360
malicious or not

530
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,760
and so rather than just like analyzing

531
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,240
the raw script they used they used these

532
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,080
words of that to

533
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,679
extract um

534
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,000
tokens and they also extracted uh and

535
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,080
they were

536
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,840
in the works back also extract some

537
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,840
context around tokens so you can get a

538
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,840
sense of the whether the tokens are

539
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,919
related to each other um

540
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,520
whether for example like you have

541
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,600
something that's negating it

542
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,840
um

543
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,679
so this so they did that and they found

544
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,679
that this so they were able to so they

545
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,280
actually noticed um these things

546
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,440
i don't know if you can see the uh

547
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,039
the uh slide but you know they noticed

548
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,559
these things that were

549
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,559
occurring kind of in close proximity to

550
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,640
each other and it doesn't show in the

551
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,039
slides exactly but uh i mean it doesn't

552
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,120
show this slide but they were all but in

553
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,520
powertrail scripting they very often use

554
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,720
um

555
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,480
aliases and powershell scripting and

556
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,039
they their techniques were very were

557
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,520
also very effective in finding um

558
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,158
aliases

559
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,400
so essentially it was pretty it's pretty

560
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,720
successful i mean again they use the uh

561
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,039
phase the trainings that powershell

562
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,480
scripts that they were already labeled

563
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,799
clear malicious and they did recognize

564
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,400
aliases

565
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
and uh

566
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,720
it it's that's it that seemed that

567
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,640
seemed pretty like a pretty impressive

568
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,640
result

569
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,240
and so that so that was that was a very

570
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,919
so that was this was an example of

571
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,440
natural language processing which is

572
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,640
kind of

573
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,440
a pretty big uh a pretty a pretty big

574
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,159
part of uh

575
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,640
of machine learning um and then

576
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,919
basically

577
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,280
like so where else in um in security

578
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,679
might uh natural language processing be

579
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,039
used um spam detection again is also a

580
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,919
very big part of that

581
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,960
oh i just saw i just saw megan's comment

582
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,320
um yeah uh sometimes goofy characters

583
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,240
that you won't see in normal stuff shows

584
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,159
up a lot sorry i just saw your comment

585
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,480
megan

586
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,919
so essentially so we also got something

587
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,880
called anomaly detection

588
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,120
so

589
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,039
so so um

590
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,559
one thing like when you got to your

591
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,559
traditional antivirus

592
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,799
actually your traditional antivirus

593
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,559
engine it depends on signatures it

594
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,799
depends on so it depends on recognizing

595
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,520
stuff you've seen before

596
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,039
and so that gets that gets really

597
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,320
interesting when you've got something

598
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,000
you haven't seen before like for example

599
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,559
like say a zero day or something

600
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,960
like uh your your typical av is not

601
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,640
going to pick up

602
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,080
a uh

603
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,080
it's not as not going to pick up a zero

604
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,679
day because there's no it has no

605
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,840
signature it's never seen it before so

606
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,200
what we're doing here is we're going to

607
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,159
we're looking at something called

608
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,080
anomaly detection

609
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,400
and so essentially uh anomaly detection

610
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,760
is just looking for things that are

611
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,080
weird

612
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,840
so what you have to do there is decide

613
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,039
what do you consider normal

614
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,200
um

615
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,120
and then the uh so the so if you have

616
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,440
something that deviates from normal

617
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,520
not even necessarily bad

618
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,799
you're gonna call that an outlier

619
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,120
in security like like an anomaly it's

620
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,360
not necessarily

621
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,960
so essentially

622
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,039
unusual behavior is not necessarily bad

623
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,640
but it correlates very highly with

624
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,840
things that you want to detect and

625
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,480
prevent like fraud and other things

626
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,039
so insecurity um

627
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,039
anomalies might very often mean that

628
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,559
you've got an intriguer or another kind

629
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,960
of breach

630
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,799
so for example what do we really want to

631
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,520
see in an intrusion detection

632
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,520
okay so

633
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,440
um so they say you want to have low

634
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,600
false positives and false negatives so

635
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,320
he falls positive is when you get like a

636
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,159
report that something bad is going on

637
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,320
but it really isn't and so that's a

638
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,480
problem because it wastes it can waste a

639
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,799
lot of stock analyst time

640
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,559
and it could also make people it could

641
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,559
also teach people to uh start ignoring

642
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,400
the ideas

643
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,159
uh a false negative is also very bad

644
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,600
that tells you that everything's fine

645
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,880
but it's not

646
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,559
there is something actually is something

647
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,600
is bad um see

648
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,960
if you essentially want it to be fairly

649
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,600
easy to work with you preferably not a

650
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,760
monster learning curve

651
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,360
uh

652
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,080
so

653
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,240
so basically so threats and attacks

654
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,320
change very fast very quickly you want

655
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,600
to be able to

656
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,799
adapt to that um

657
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,400
you and

658
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,840
you you might have only a certain amount

659
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,679
of computing power and space and

660
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,840
resources to get to donate to uh

661
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,440
dedicate to it

662
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,279
so you might want to stay within that

663
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,480
and then there's

664
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,000
something called um explainable alerts

665
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,520
and so when you talk about explainable

666
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,440
it's like it's like your idea says

667
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,679
something bad is going on you want to be

668
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,080
able to track trace down why it thinks

669
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,799
that that is

670
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,880
yeah that's that's kind of an important

671
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,760
thing

672
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,520
so like for example then explain it with

673
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,320
an explainer with an explainable alert

674
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,440
you don't want to like disable

675
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,840
somebody's account without knowing why

676
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,840
so here's your

677
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,760
so this is uh when you're looking at

678
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,120
host

679
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,720
intrusion detecting signals these are

680
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,840
just some of the things that you might

681
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,120
look at

682
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,960
you might look at processes like if

683
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,760
you're

684
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,919
seeing a new process that you've never

685
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,320
seen before is that legitimate or is it

686
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,439
not um

687
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,360
like hey like do you do you know how

688
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,120
they do have a new user account when you

689
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,159
didn't actually create one um

690
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,720
your kernel modules um like

691
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,919
your dns

692
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,000
your dns lookups like is it look is you

693
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,120
or are you starting to have like these

694
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,960
dns queries that are looking up like

695
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,039
sketchy.ru

696
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,640
or something like that

697
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,880
maybe that's not good

698
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,520
uh unexplainable network connections and

699
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,320
then

700
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,559
um like a lot of times like with with

701
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,000
your operating system it maintains some

702
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,919
kind of registry or database with its

703
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,159
configuration um

704
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,240
like the registry would be windows and

705
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,000
if you start seeing new things popping

706
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,440
up in that that's not very good

707
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,880
so this is this is a just a fairly

708
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,080
useful tool um

709
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,559
os query so it is so always query can

710
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,320
measure reliability and compliance but

711
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,679
it is often used for intrusion

712
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:18,960
detections

713
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,720
um

714
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,880
what might it be looking for like uh for

715
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,880
example you could use os query to look

716
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,720
at your top five memory hogging

717
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,200
processes

718
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,840
and um i

719
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,679
so one one limitation is that it is not

720
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,760
it is not really built to be to operate

721
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,480
in an untrusted environment

722
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,840
and it doesn't so os query does not have

723
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,679
built-in or orchestration but it does

724
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,000
play nicely with like chef and ansible

725
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,200
and puppet if you want to run that

726
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,080
that's that is just a fairly that's just

727
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,000
a very pretty useful tool

728
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,960
um

729
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,960
so let's talk a little bit about network

730
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,840
intrusion detection

731
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,159
so typically as we said before so you've

732
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:08,799
a

733
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,279
compromised host it's very often to be

734
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,440
um initiating

735
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,120
oh thank you

736
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,120
it's very going to be initiating some

737
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,960
kind of communication with the outside

738
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,720
the outside world

739
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,279
um because it needs to reach out to uh

740
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,799
what

741
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,158
to whatever is controlling it

742
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,240
and you like really like you can't

743
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,799
really you can't connect really count on

744
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,799
um whatever is controlling to be able to

745
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,640
uh reach out to the compromised machine

746
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,880
i mean the networking firewall settings

747
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,760
may not allow that

748
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,799
and um

749
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,399
basically here are some examples and

750
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,559
you've got your botnets um a lot of

751
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,159
times your

752
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,159
apts are typically going to allow remote

753
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,600
uh access and then you've got your

754
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,039
typical edward and spyware

755
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,640
and just some some tools uh i mean well

756
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,039
tcv tcp dump is

757
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,480
pretty much a standard for network

758
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,480
monitoring um

759
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,080
then there's uh

760
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,120
snort and there's a and

761
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,960
zeke which was also which was really

762
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,880
known as bro which you could do a lot of

763
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,399
really cool things with though there is

764
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,799
somewhat of a learning curve

765
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:19,919
and

766
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,120
network intrusion has typically

767
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,679
has typically used signatures in the

768
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,840
past

769
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,279
yeah just for

770
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,120
for what it is worth just uh going back

771
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,600
to snort and bro snort is a fairly

772
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,159
simple rule-based engine um

773
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,159
bro kind of offers the deep heck of an

774
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,480
inspection which can generate a

775
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,480
whole lot of uh features for anomaly

776
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,840
detection

777
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,880
like for example you might be able to

778
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,039
detect pivoting um it will offer some um

779
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,799
geolocation

780
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,039
and more detailed information about know

781
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,919
about networks like asn and netflix and

782
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:02,960
stuff

783
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,440
if you want that

784
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,440
and then he and then here's another um

785
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,919
web application intrusion detection

786
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,039
that's

787
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,720
like your web applications are very

788
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,480
often

789
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,360
are

790
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,919
i think your web applications are like

791
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,960
very often targets

792
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,840
so

793
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,520
like what like uh

794
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,600
what's you so you're typically like your

795
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,799
source of data with your web

796
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,880
applications is often like your http

797
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,640
logs

798
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,039
um

799
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,120
and it's true like for example um like

800
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,000
with your typical apache um

801
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,240
whatever it does not necessarily log

802
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,840
post data by default but you could you

803
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,199
can get add-ons that do

804
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,918
um

805
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,360
let's see so you can look at yeah you

806
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,840
can look at ipl access little

807
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,240
statistics i mean for example uh if a

808
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,279
if a

809
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,600
machine in a country that's that would

810
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,440
not typically like do business with you

811
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,320
that's

812
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,399
often hostile is repeatedly accessing

813
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,080
your web your app that might be some

814
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,440
that might be um

815
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,679
something bad you're

816
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,039
um

817
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,760
i mean so like your uh url string

818
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,159
aberrations um

819
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,880
the so they may be trying to uh escape

820
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,120
characters

821
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,440
or experimental like null bytes string

822
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,440
termination um

823
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,840
and also like just an unusual sequence

824
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,399
of action might also signal fuzzing

825
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,919
and fuzzing is essentially when you just

826
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,000
start directing a whole lot of different

827
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,519
kinds of input in hopes that you will

828
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,320
discover something

829
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,159
um

830
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,559
let's see so unusual refer preferred

831
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,240
patterns um

832
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,279
so

833
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,720
one thing like if you're using like an

834
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,000
automatic automated tool like uh curl or

835
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,600
something like that

836
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,240
i mean unless you explicitly set it uh

837
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,919
your

838
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,799
um you may have like no you may um your

839
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,799
referral patterns in your agent and

840
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,720
stuff might look a little bit unusual

841
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,399
and it's it's not that using coral is

842
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,080
bad but uh

843
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,519
that does mean that they're so they're

844
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,960
throwing something automated at your

845
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,279
system

846
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,279
and just a sequence of access to

847
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,600
endpoints again that would suggest that

848
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,840
they're

849
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,799
uh that they're made that they're

850
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,640
basically uh that they're basically

851
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,159
crawling

852
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,159
or possibly trying to look for something

853
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:34,960
that's

854
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,559
something that's not good

855
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,679
or trying to look for something that's

856
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,679
vulnerable

857
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,159
so forecasting

858
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,720
so the the idea with forecasting is that

859
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,120
the forecasting itself is kind of a it's

860
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,240
actually a very intuitive way of

861
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,120
performing um anomaly detection so we

862
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,799
learn from our private room for our

863
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,960
prior data and so from our prior data we

864
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,320
try to make it we try to predict what

865
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,320
may happen in the future

866
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,799
and we start looking so

867
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,320
if what we're experiencing is

868
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,679
significantly different than what we

869
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,120
predicted

870
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:19,919
um

871
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,360
we we would consider that anomalous

872
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,000
um

873
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,919
and so you're with your more uh your

874
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:28,720
more

875
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,320
sophisticated pattern you can also

876
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,200
recognize um trends

877
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,360
and seasons like for example if you have

878
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,039
uh

879
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,679
basically like periodic repetitions of

880
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,679
patterns in the data

881
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,760
um

882
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,600
like a more sophisticated algorithm

883
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,639
would be able to recognize that

884
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,120
so we're looking at arima the

885
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,120
auto regressive

886
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,479
integrated moving patterns

887
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,600
yeah and so auto aggressive just means

888
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,960
that you've got a statistical model

889
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,639
that's basically dependent on its own

890
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,960
past

891
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,359
so like auto correlation is like uh how

892
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,239
does the how does uh the what's present

893
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,839
correlate with what's in the past

894
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,359
so essentially i don't it's kind of hard

895
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,280
to it's hard to tell i don't know if you

896
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,480
guys want me to go into this or not

897
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,879
um but let's see so this would here is

898
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,599
an example for here's an example of the

899
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,280
of the data series you can see kind of

900
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,839
this cycle but it's overall trending

901
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,239
trending upward

902
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,000
so like uh well like so why would we

903
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,199
care about this for security

904
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,200
um

905
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,359
like uh in this one and this one we're

906
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,599
maybe seeing a diurnal pattern like

907
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,440
stuff that occurs every 24 hours

908
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,200
and um

909
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,440
with an overall trend so let's look so

910
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,880
i'm going to apply this to security

911
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,359
in this case we're going to have um cpu

912
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,640
utilization over time

913
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,320
so why would we

914
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,920
um

915
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,000
for example why would we care about cpu

916
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,200
utilization so if your cp so if your cpu

917
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,240
utilization is off uh it might mean

918
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,320
something unusual is going on and it's

919
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,160
not necessarily bad i mean maybe

920
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,680
somebody dropped an update on you or

921
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,440
something uh

922
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,640
there's maybe there's a legitimate

923
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,200
reason for it or maybe a uh bitcoin

924
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,760
miner is gracing your system with his

925
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,200
presence

926
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,400
or maybe something else bad is going on

927
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,440
but uh cpu utilization could be

928
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,240
could be an um an indicator of of some

929
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,880
kind of compromise or an or an anomaly

930
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,680
you might want to look into

931
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,440
so essentially in this case

932
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,760
in this case we're using our see we're

933
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,560
fitting in our cpu utilization with an

934
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,320
arima model to see how close it is

935
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,720
and this in this case we're starting to

936
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,000
see

937
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
something that's off something something

938
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,839
is different than what we expect

939
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,480
here we've got our

940
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,640
actual observed data points and it's not

941
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,480
really following a trend something's

942
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,320
going something is

943
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,520
something is off um and we might and so

944
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,800
it's like you might want to look into

945
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,160
what is going on in that server

946
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,400
so we're going to so malware analysis is

947
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,000
another thing you would you can use

948
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,760
machine learning to do um

949
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,599
uh typically with malware analysis you

950
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,760
kind of you group it by family you've

951
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,000
got like your code and capability a lot

952
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,839
of times it comes from a comes from a

953
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,280
group and you'll see

954
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,079
uh

955
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,680
and for example it's common to see melt

956
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,359
one kind of malware that's derived from

957
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,599
another um a traditional

958
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,440
traditional approach to malware analysis

959
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,800
it's kind of like virus that you have a

960
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,520
signature um it's which is basically a

961
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,200
collection of

962
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,720
known data and you try to match it to

963
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,680
something known from before um

964
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,000
and you can also you can also do um

965
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,560
um you can also do something i'll do use

966
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,000
techniques called static and dynamic

967
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,680
analysis um

968
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,800
static analysis would be like uh when

969
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,119
basic basically when you uh just take

970
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,560
the take the co take it apart

971
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,160
disassemble it or something and maybe

972
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,760
forget impulse like start looking for

973
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,680
interesting strings which show up a lot

974
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,480
in malware um dynamic analysis might be

975
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,160
like when you run it in like a vm

976
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,520
sandbox or something like that

977
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,400
and you can have uh you also have

978
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,880
metamorphic and polymorphic

979
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,640
malware analysis for example like the

980
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,200
configure family

981
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,960
so for example what might you see when

982
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,160
you're analyzing um

983
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,079
[Music]

984
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,400
uh potential android malware

985
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,960
well for example you might see

986
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,599
um interesting strings um like for

987
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:18,880
example what kinds of interesting

988
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,240
strings might you see you might see

989
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,320
references to system binary you might

990
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,320
see server addresses like you've got it

991
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,560
like you've got a hard-coded ip what's

992
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,960
it what's that doing um

993
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,680
you've got uh checks for it for emulated

994
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,359
environments uh you know

995
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:37,359
uh why would you want to do that um

996
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:38,480
um

997
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,839
like okay so why might they want to

998
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,119
check for an emulated environment

999
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,079
because they want to know if it's

1000
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,040
running in a sandbox

1001
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,200
and it and also kind of like as we saw

1002
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,359
with the powershell scripts um

1003
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:53,119
obfuscation also shows up a lot

1004
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,680
and what um and then you then you're

1005
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,359
then you're also looking for uh like i

1006
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:58,880
guess

1007
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,800
you kind of sketchy api calls um

1008
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,280
and also potentially uh changes to the

1009
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,240
changes to your system

1010
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,640
so typically what are the

1011
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,839
limitations of uh

1012
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,040
so you've been doing a lot of very

1013
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,560
useful things with machine learning um

1014
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,400
but it's not really a silver bullet i

1015
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,079
had to put this picture there

1016
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,320
to show it to basically to show my age i

1017
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,920
don't know if anybody else recognizes it

1018
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,240
or not

1019
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,640
um

1020
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,079
but essentially there's essentially it's

1021
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,920
no syllable or bullet like as we talked

1022
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,800
about

1023
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,359
earlier um

1024
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,599
there's like ex like explainability is a

1025
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,599
problem like for example like if you get

1026
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,520
a result and it's not really cl if you

1027
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,839
get if it sends you a warning um and

1028
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,920
it's not really clear why why it did it

1029
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,920
or where it came from and you are not

1030
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,520
sure whether you can act on it um

1031
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,119
you know and like with the vast body of

1032
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,720
human knowledge it's like

1033
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,599
people know a whole lot of things um

1034
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,599
and you can't just dump it raw into a

1035
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,200
machine learning system you have to find

1036
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,200
a way to represent all that knowledge in

1037
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,800
a way that um

1038
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,640
that a machine can under can understand

1039
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,000
and that could be quite challenging

1040
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,839
there's

1041
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,200
oh yeah thank you thank you very much

1042
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,119
leo leah

1043
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,760
i'm not um i'm so old like you remember

1044
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,119
hearing his songs as a kid

1045
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,560
thank you so thank you so i'm so glad

1046
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,680
somebody else recognized him

1047
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,720
and then there's something called

1048
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,000
overfitting and under feeding that we

1049
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,079
didn't really talk about

1050
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,760
um

1051
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,400
so essentially uh overfitting is like is

1052
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,920
like for example when you when you have

1053
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,880
a model that fits the training data very

1054
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,720
very well

1055
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,800
but then it doesn't but it

1056
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,480
it fits only the training data and it

1057
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,760
doesn't do

1058
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,680
so it fits the training data so well

1059
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,960
that it

1060
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,839
that it's it uh performs less well with

1061
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,920
real world data and then other under

1062
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,920
fitting is like what it doesn't fit the

1063
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,880
the training data very well um i mean it

1064
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,880
just it doesn't fit the data very well

1065
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,160
it's too general to be useful

1066
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,920
and then another very big problem with

1067
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,680
um with machine with machine learning

1068
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,280
it's the whole idea of garbage in

1069
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,040
garbage out probably like we've all

1070
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,359
heard we've all heard about we've all

1071
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:22,880
heard that phrase with computers in

1072
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,680
general um

1073
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,079
so so uh with machine well with machine

1074
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,480
learning

1075
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,520
there's a lot of problems with that um

1076
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,079
one thing that's a particular particular

1077
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,119
issue here is that machine is that um

1078
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,880
machine learnings can be deliberately

1079
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,599
exposed to uh malicious input in fact

1080
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,760
there's a lot of papers on machine

1081
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,040
learning and security like if somebody

1082
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,400
just uh deliberately uh sprays a system

1083
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,839
with bad data

1084
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:55,520
uh you're going to have a bad model

1085
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,440
and so if you want to learn more about

1086
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,200
that you could probably google like you

1087
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,480
probably just do a search on like

1088
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,839
adversarial machine learning

1089
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,720
so essentially some of the takeaways um

1090
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,319
there's

1091
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,640
so there's a lot of potential to

1092
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,839
automate to some of the tedious tasks

1093
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:18,400
save like soc analyst time and that's

1094
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,680
good

1095
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,960
um

1096
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,359
detecting anomalies is is good like for

1097
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,079
example particularly for example with a

1098
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:29,200
zero days or novel or apts or something

1099
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,920
that that don't have known signatures

1100
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,440
and wouldn't be detected by like a

1101
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,760
traditional um engine

1102
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,839
uh i mean you still have a risk of error

1103
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,160
you could get a you could get a

1104
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,680
you could have your time wasted with a

1105
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,240
bunch of false positives or could fail

1106
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,000
to catch problems

1107
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,839
so my takeaway is that i think it could

1108
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:49,599
save a lot of time it could you can do a

1109
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,359
lot of really cool interesting things

1110
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:52,560
but i think you're there's still going

1111
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,400
to be a need for competent security

1112
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,760
professionals it's

1113
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,760
not going to take your uh it's not going

1114
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,480
to take your jobs away

1115
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,440
so please don't worry

1116
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,240
and

1117
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,599
here's some

1118
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:09,599
machine learning just just some links to

1119
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,040
machine learning software and i will

1120
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,520
post my slides i'm wayward 710 on

1121
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,720
twitter and i'll go ahead and post the

1122
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,480
slides just in case there's any useful

1123
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,480
information in them i post the whole

1124
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,319
powerpoint slide and i wanted to get

1125
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,400
some some credit to

1126
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,480
place it into uh some of the books and

1127
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,400
stuff that i'd use to get to get some

1128
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,480
examples like the machine learning and

1129
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,920
security is especially good book and

1130
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,520
i at least in the past have been able to

1131
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,760
get it through a humble bundle

1132
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,280
which is a really good deal

1133
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,760
and the and uh the silent the silence uh

1134
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,359
book believe it or not is free and

1135
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,319
that's really not bad

1136
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,760
then i just put some other resources for

1137
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,440
anybody that anybody might be interested

1138
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,040
in

1139
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,359
and

1140
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,520
oh so oh thanks thanks megan uh and

1141
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,560
thanks ratchet um yeah actually megan i

1142
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,960
did put i put some links some resources

1143
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,040
in my slides and i will

1144
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,400
post the slides is that okay

1145
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,040
is that okay

1146
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,599
yeah thank you very much leah that's me

1147
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,520
and seriously thank you for listening to

1148
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,280
me this was this was it was really it's

1149
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,800
it's really it's really kind of weird

1150
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,400
presenting virtually and in front of a

1151
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,240
in front of a live audience but i thank

1152
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,160
you for staying with me uh does anybody

1153
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,359
have any questions well we still have

1154
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:32,359
time

1155
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,520
or any questions

1156
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,880
i think i saw one earlier but i was

1157
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,520
hoping maybe it could be rewarded

1158
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,839
yeah that

1159
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:51,520
one uh to practically

1160
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,839
implement ddos attack using ensemble

1161
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:56,240
learning

1162
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,800
um

1163
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,280
let's see to be honest i

1164
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,119
i really do not know that answer off the

1165
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,240
top of my head i'm very sorry

1166
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,000
yeah i think so um i

1167
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
like uh richie i would be happy to try

1168
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,839
to maybe google that for you

1169
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,599
but just unfortunately i don't i do not

1170
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:18,960
have a good answer to that on top of my

1171
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,160
head

1172
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,800
oh gosh thank you so much

1173
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,640
oh um um megan does bias and impact

1174
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,040
security analysis

1175
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,839
data sets

1176
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:36,000
um i would say quite possibly because

1177
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,119
um

1178
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:38,800
quite possibly like i know that it's a

1179
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,640
problem with real world data sets i mean

1180
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,000
like we've got

1181
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,720
like there's some known problems with um

1182
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,280
for example racism being introduced into

1183
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,200
algorithms and potentially causing a lot

1184
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,960
of trouble i don't know if anybody

1185
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,640
saw the network slide it talked about

1186
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,040
the the algorithmic justice league is

1187
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,000
worth searching for um

1188
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,440
with uh with computer security um

1189
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,960
i would say like for example with the

1190
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,480
supervised learning you're you're

1191
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,280
getting your uh pre-label data sets

1192
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,040
and so it's possible like if you had

1193
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,440
some less than entirely

1194
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,119
accurate data sets going into a

1195
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:14,480
supervised learning

1196
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,160
class like for example you use for

1197
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,520
classification

1198
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,599
it's quite possible that could influence

1199
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:20,720
the

1200
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:24,160
the uh results

1201
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,760
yeah thank you so much that is and there

1202
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,480
was a netflix special about that and

1203
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,400
i've been really very impressed with the

1204
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,400
work that group's done

1205
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,440
oh yeah thank you so much

1206
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:40,640
all right well if there's no more

1207
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,319
questions i just want to say this is a

1208
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:44,400
great talk we got a lot of conversation

1209
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,480
that was going on people really seem to

1210
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,319
appreciate it so thank you so much for

1211
