3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,160
if you were sticking around from the

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,480

up for our next talk which is protecting

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,880
the source of our spark i'm really

28
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,880
looking forward to this because it has a

29
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,119
lot to do with ics

30
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,960
and ot type systems um very interesting

31
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,600
um to look forward to i do want to

32
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,920
introduce with one other little friend

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,600
of mine this is oscar oscar the unicorn

34
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,040
and oscar will say let's get this talk

35
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,759
started

36
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,840
take it away megan

37
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,840
hi everybody thank you very much for

38
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,920
coming to my presentation this evening

39
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,840
or afternoon

40
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,320
uh is everyone seeing my screen i am

41
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,320
getting community oh there we go it

42
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,960
looks like we are good to go

43
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,399
all right and with that in mind let's

44
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,878
continue

45
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,080
okay so a little bit about me and my

46
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,720
notes so as a career profile i am a

47
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,239
senior consultant

48
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,120
at security risk advisors

49
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,800
my security vocation is i started as a

50
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,040
security and compliance man

51
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,959
project manager at an accounts

52
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,879
receivables firm

53
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,319
and i

54
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,920
um

55
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,160
i was not quite sure if i wanted to do

56
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,319
cyber security at the time

57
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,920
uh but at this uh when i uh there was a

58
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,920
an attack in paris

59
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,239
i'm getting some feedback from everyone

60
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,440
is everyone able to see my screen

61
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,480
maybe not

62
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,239
um

63
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,640
okay

64
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,440
we having some technological issues give

65
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,599
me just a second let me talk to my mc

66
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,200
all right

67
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,760
and with that in mind looks like we are

68
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,200
good to go

69
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,599
anyway so

70
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,120
okay awesome i'm getting some

71
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,280
information from cat looks like i'm good

72
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,560
all right so my security vocation began

73
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,120
as a security and compliance manager at

74
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,440
an accounts receivables firm

75
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,560
i learned to love security from the fact

76
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,840
that um

77
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,080
a terrorist attack actually occurred in

78
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,840
paris at 2015. uh it was later found out

79
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,440
that the attack was completely

80
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,920
coordinated through playstation 4

81
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,599
communications

82
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,920
which was just mind-boggling to me uh

83
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,200
and that's when

84
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,680
my love for security kind of solidified

85
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,280
i determined that i wanted to do

86
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,000
everything that i could possibly do

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,560
to protect my family and friends via the

88
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,000
web

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,120
a fun fact about me by the way is that i

90
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,239
am completely and totally obsessed with

91
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,879
buffy the vampire slayer i still watch

92
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,239
it multiple times throughout the year

93
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,760
uh i am recently a mom to a six month

94
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,159
old baby as you can see from the slide i

95
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,360
got married and moved states bought a

96
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,000
home and got my practice child dog who

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,959
you see

98
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,600
in a very poor picture you can see all

99
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,360
of the objects that i was currently

100
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,960
moving at the time

101
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,840
but this is my little family my hobbies

102
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,440
include keeping all of them alive

103
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,759
meditating and trying to find the find

104
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,120
the zen

105
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,759
and sleeping whenever i can

106
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,560
so we're going to go through how ics and

107
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,000
ot security impacts your life on a daily

108
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,320
basis because i have a feeling that most

109
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,400
of you are not quite sure what is and

110
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,840
how it does

111
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,080
we'll review the current landscape so

112
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,040
the with the news so i'll go back as far

113
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,680
as 2010 but we should i want you to keep

114
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,000
in mind that a lot of these attacks were

115
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,560
occurring as early as early of 20th

116
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,400
century

117
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,400
we'll go through some system components

118
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,080
where they're identified within the

119
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,080
purdue model framework what their

120
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,919
purpose is and what industry you can

121
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,360
find them in

122
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,240
the technological differences between it

123
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,039
and ot as well

124
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,960
risk management that it's currently

125
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,680
affiliated with ot devices and how they

126
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,120
differ from i t

127
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,360
i'll provide some solutions and how to

128
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,520
get started

129
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,360
and from there i'll give you some

130
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,120
continuous learning and development

131
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,600
activities

132
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,240
all right there are 16 critical

133
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,560
infrastructure components some of which

134
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,160
could be energy

135
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,600
pharmaceutical research and development

136
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,360
manufacturing transportation

137
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,800
smart cities

138
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,320
uh government defenses energy nuclear

139
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,440
production

140
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,479
transportation via well navy here and

141
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,600
then also medical devices

142
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,440
and with that in mind critical

143
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,520
infrastructure is defined as

144
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,880
infrastructure

145
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,720
that would have debilitating

146
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,160
consequences

147
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,000
without

148
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
debilitating consequences for physical

149
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,280
and logical assets

150
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,840
all right give me just a second

151
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,919
all right oh sorry there was just a

152
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,759
little bit of lag looks like i'm having

153
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,080
some construction in the area but we

154
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,600
move on

155
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,000
so that was the cyber security

156
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,039
infrastructure security

157
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,759
definition of critical infrastructure so

158
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,840
from manufacturing plants to medical

159
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,160
labs to our power grid they all

160
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,080
represent critical infrastructure that

161
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,840
can be exploited to cause unimaginable

162
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,039
consequences so

163
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,440
consider the statistic for a second

164
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,120
there are currently more connected

165
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,520
devices than there are people in this

166
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,479
world

167
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,599
which is just mind-boggling to me

168
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,440
and recently there's been a trend to

169
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,759
incorporate internet of things devices

170
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,160
into the industrial sector which is

171
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,440
coined as industrial iot

172
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,639
and some examples of iiot devices can be

173
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,759
hvac systems smart meters logistics and

174
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,919
tracking remote monitors and medical

175
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,520
equipment

176
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,759
so some examples i'd like to run through

177
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,639
are

178
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,120
remote heart surgery and smart traffic

179
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,039
lights

180
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,520
the proper the purpose of remote heart

181
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,919
surgery technology is to redefine health

182
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,720
care by providing superior services from

183
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,120
specialized physicians wherever they may

184
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,639
be

185
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,319
there are several components to this and

186
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,720
why it's beneficial to society

187
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,720
one of them is that we don't really have

188
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,560
enough skilled workers that can complete

189
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,319
this kind of surgery

190
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,479
so we don't want it to we don't want

191
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,720
location to be a factor to everyone's

192
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,400
health care

193
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,360
a specialized physician like i mentioned

194
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,599
can be called upon at any time during an

195
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,639
emergency if there is a remote program

196
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,319
and the amount of money that can be

197
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,280
saved not transporting that physician if

198
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,039
it is a scheduled heart surgery which

199
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,360
sometimes they may not be

200
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,919
is very beneficial to the overall cost

201
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,240
and can help the associate and the

202
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,039
medical affairs

203
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,080
so some issues with this is that there

204
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,080
could be dire consequences if it is

205
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,199
interrupted

206
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,960
technology it could be brought offline

207
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,280
for numerous reasons

208
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,639
the reasons i'm going to talk to you

209
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,799
about include cyber attack

210
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,360
so this could mean someone's life if the

211
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,440
remote heart program has been brought

212
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,958
down now i'm not a medical professional

213
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,039
whatsoever

214
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,360
so i'm sure there has to be some sort of

215
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,399
backup here um if the physician the

216
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,560
remote physician is lost i'm sure there

217
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,120
is a physician that could take over

218
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,760
whatever that may be it's a situation no

219
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,080
one wants to be in

220
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,320
another example i like to use is smart

221
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,360
cities

222
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,440
which are contributing to the overall

223
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,519
safety and well-being of the residents

224
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,600
by deploying emergency

225
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,600
vehicles and providing real-time

226
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,399
communications to ensure traffic signals

227
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,080
are synchronized to help decrease the

228
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,640
time spent on the road

229
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,880
i think most of us have either been that

230
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,000
person or seen a person who is trying to

231
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,440
frantically get out of the way of an

232
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,560
emergency vehicle well smart cities are

233
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,360
here and have cameras and lights to

234
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,399
inform you when an emergency vehicle is

235
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,800
at hand and when they're nearby so

236
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,320
you're not that person in the middle of

237
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,000
the intersection getting in the way of

238
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,839
them

239
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,880
so

240
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,279
these are great things and can really

241
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,800
help our community and health and

242
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,839
well-being

243
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,240
but exploitation of this infrastructure

244
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,720
can cause power outages shortages and

245
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,279
smart vehicles interrupt manufacturing

246
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,680
lines and a million other possibilities

247
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,519
which could overall affect our daily

248
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,839
lives

249
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,240
so let's imagine for a second an example

250
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,000
that has been really close to home for

251
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,320
all of us over the past year and a half

252
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,560
the coronavirus

253
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,440
you're probably asking how does cyber

254
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,560
security impact the coronavirus

255
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,680
well

256
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,720
most r d labs utilize a large amount of

257
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,279
industrial iot

258
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,519
if manufacturing line has been disrupted

259
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,600
because of a cyber attack then that

260
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,839
means fewer dosages made

261
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,560
more time to distribute and since every

262
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,560
minute hour and day can mean a huge

263
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,079
difference for those in critical

264
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,320
condition from coven

265
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,320
it's monumental

266
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,480
what if the labs in quality control are

267
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,560
impacted by a cyber attack

268
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,640
this means that the dosages can't be

269
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,519
tested due diligence can't be completed

270
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,279
and without confirmation that those

271
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,920
dosages meet the safety requirements

272
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,079
the dosages can't be distributed and

273
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,160
again we're running into the scenario

274
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,000
where we aren't distributing the dosages

275
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
fast enough

276
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,920
another scenario is of logistics and

277
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,600
tracking system is brought down by a

278
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,839
cyber attack how are the how are the

279
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,880
distributors or the transportation teams

280
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,360
supposed to know who gets what dosages

281
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,800
and how many

282
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,760
when they're projected to arrive

283
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,800
and

284
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
that so to summarize there could be a

285
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,560
lot of different scenarios when

286
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,640
something could go very wrong throughout

287
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,399
the development and delivery of any

288
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,920
vaccines

289
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,839
people generally don't think that cyber

290
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,920
security impacts everyone like other

291
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,160
career choices but those people are

292
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,279
wrong

293
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,600
all folks in cyber security directly

294
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,680
impact the health safety and happiness

295
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,120
of a lot of different people and

296
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,839
communities throughout their

297
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,880
work it is unfortunate however that uh

298
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,800
cyber security isn't a job where you

299
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,640
hear about good things happening on the

300
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,880
news

301
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,959
for example cyber security experts don't

302
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,279
necessarily get limelight like we might

303
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,440
deserve when things are going well

304
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,200
but rest assured those within the

305
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,440
security community recognize the long

306
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,440
hours and the sacrifice you put in

307
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,720
so like i mentioned earlier there has

308
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,079
technically been ics ot cyber attacks

309
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,480
since the early 1900s

310
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,320
however with the increase in internet

311
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,880
connected devices the threat landscape

312
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,839
has grown exponentially

313
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,920
with that i'm going to activate our

314
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,639
first poll i'm gonna send it via chat

315
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,480
let's see cat what would be the best way

316
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,079
to send it in chat here

317
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,399
um

318
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,560
we might not be able to do this i think

319
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,920
i'm a little bit technologically

320
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,279
challenged

321
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,160
but

322
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,839
either way we'll go back

323
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,680
the poll is

324
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,560
can you guess the percentage change in

325
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,760
ics ot cyber attacks between 2018 and

326
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,200
2019.

327
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,519
uh it's a little bit of an astrological

328
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,760
number at 2 000 increase from 2018 to

329
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,000
2019.

330
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,880
a recent study was conducted with 150

331
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,200
individuals involved in security

332
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,440
strategy within the manufacturing space

333
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,480
and slightly over half of the people

334
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,959
said that their sites are definitely

335
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,360
vulnerable to cyber attacks

336
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,360
of course the reasons for this weren't

337
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,600
outlined since that they could basically

338
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,360
be giving the hackers keys to their

339
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,320
kingdom

340
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,160
but there could be numerous

341
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,639
possibilities some of which could be a

342
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,120
faulty network segmentation legacy

343
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,680
operating systems are able to be patched

344
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,880
in access control

345
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,240
tennoble vice president of ot security

346
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,240
marty edwards mentioned that they are

347
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,880
seeing two common paths for ot

348
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,800
exploitation

349
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,920
one being direct internet connectivity

350
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,680
and two phishing attacks that are

351
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,240
targeted at enterprise network

352
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,079
megan i'm going to interrupt you really

353
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,920
quick just for a second

354
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,399
in the comments section

355
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,800
on the right hand side that's yeah you

356
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,079
can post the polls that you want to do

357
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,800
fabulous okay well thank you cat i

358
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,600
appreciate you awesome okay well i won't

359
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,639
have everyone no keep going i won't have

360
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,399
everyone miss out on the next one then

361
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,760
because that they're they could be good

362
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,720
okay uh so

363
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,920
not only do oh here we go back to it so

364
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,240
the recent attack factors include

365
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,079
enterprise access

366
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,480
and phishing attacks because

367
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,480
you would be shocked to see that a lot

368
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,880
of enterprise and ot manufacturing

369
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,120
networks share the same physical

370
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,240
connection

371
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,120
so once a an attacker gets into the

372
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,440
enterprise network

373
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,519
the chance of lateral movement being

374
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,880
able to happen and to get access or some

375
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,959
sort of control into the manufacturing

376
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,720
network is not that complicated

377
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,440
so not only do we have that

378
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,760
we also have

379
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,120
um interesting amount we also have a

380
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,079
labor shortage at this point so

381
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,120
with this in mind 58 of companies are

382
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,279
struggling to find someone with both

383
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,760
experience in manufacturing and

384
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,920
production

385
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,360
i've gone through

386
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,320
a lot of trends so far before i move on

387
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,199
i do have this posted so if you are like

388
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,880
me and you want to dirt out at your

389
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,199
leisure and go through all of these

390
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,880
articles i'll have them posted at the

391
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,399
end

392
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,000
just to let you know

393
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,279
so some of you are probably wondering

394
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,600
the anticipation might be killing you

395
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,959
um

396
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,160
what is solarwinds triton stuxnet and

397
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,839
havoc's doing here and why haven't i

398
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,519
mentioned them well

399
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,079
we're getting into it

400
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,639
so solarwinds is top of mind we'll start

401
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,920
with that

402
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,079
this attack may not have been targeted

403
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,360
specifically at ics ot infrastructure

404
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,440
but it did manage to impact the energy

405
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,199
sector the department of homeland

406
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,440
security and the treasury department all

407
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,279
in one foul swoop

408
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,680
according to the north american electric

409
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,240
reliability corporation nerc

410
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,440
which is a mouthful 25 percent of power

411
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,519
utilities were exposed via the

412
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,040
solarwinds attack

413
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,279
however there is little information out

414
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,680
there right now about how much impact

415
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,880
occurred within the ics ot technology in

416
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,360
the power plants there's still a lot of

417
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,440
information being gathered to see

418
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,519
exactly how much damage the attack

419
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,480
occurred

420
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,639
happened upon since it did occur just a

421
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,959
couple of months ago

422
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,759
and since it did occur very soon i

423
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,279
encourage you to stay up to date on

424
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,399
following the news headlines

425
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,800
if you have my memory you might need

426
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,480
some more information and for me to jog

427
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,240
your memory on the other attacks listed

428
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,519
here

429
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,639
so stuxnet is identified as the first

430
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,959
advanced persistent attack targeted

431
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,400
specifically at ics ot infrastructure at

432
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,119
an iranian nuclear facility

433
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,760
the worm completely altered the co alter

434
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,839
the code at the nuclear facility which

435
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,400
in turn destroyed the plant centrifuges

436
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,959
causing them to burn out

437
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,959
eventually the worm was modified and

438
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,039
targeted to other sectors including

439
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,599
water treatment plants power and oil and

440
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,199
gas

441
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,160
so

442
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,319
i want to say this is the fun part but i

443
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,520
know it's not

444
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,960
the attack was spread via a usb drive to

445
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,400
windows machines

446
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,000
so in my head

447
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,640
i have this visage of

448
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,320
an employee in the parking lot seeing a

449
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,720
usb drive in the parking lot on the

450
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,480
ground thinking i wonder what's on this

451
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,120
usb drive let's put it into my computer

452
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,360
to see what happens and then they run

453
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,520
and execute i have no idea if this

454
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,520
actually happens but this is the story i

455
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,000
like to tell myself

456
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,720
the developers of stuxnet reportedly

457
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,039
programmed the worm to expire in june of

458
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,160
2012 and the vendor corrected the plc

459
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,400
issue that led to this flaw but the

460
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,880
legacy of stuxnet lives on to this day

461
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,640
with other attacks using its sorts code

462
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,440
triton attack which was targeted at

463
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,000
safety instrumented systems where it

464
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,160
deployed the malicious code to reprogram

465
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,919
these controllers

466
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:22,640
so

467
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,880
the result of this incident was the cis

468
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,200
controllers triggered a shutdown an

469
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,200
important thing for you to know here i

470
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,320
will go over what assist controller is

471
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,200
but it is directly in related to

472
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,360
someone's overall safety within a power

473
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,440
plant manufacturing basically any ics ot

474
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,760
infrastructure

475
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,960
so

476
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,440
the result of this attack

477
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,760
made a safe shutdown occur

478
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,240
but the entire manufacturing process was

479
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,320
halted because of that hindering

480
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,240
productivity while the investigation

481
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,559
occurred

482
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,039
havocs it's a remote access trojan or a

483
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,880
rat and for those of you who don't know

484
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,799
what a rat is it's a program that

485
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,039
includes a back door for administrative

486
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,679
control the back door is very easily

487
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,240
hidden in legitimate software and if

488
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,720
this is the case and in this case it

489
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,240
occurred from an infected vendor website

490
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,880
the havocs rat utilized a common ics

491
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,919
communication protocol called opc for

492
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,200
reconnaissance and data exfiltration

493
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,320
so

494
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,640
all of these attacks directly

495
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,799
or indirectly targeted ics ot systems

496
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,200
i mean take a look at a handful of the

497
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,120
attacks that are making the headlines in

498
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,880
2021 alone

499
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,840
there is more here um there is a ferry

500
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,760
attack on the east coast for the

501
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,520
transportation system there was the jbs

502
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,480
i had to stop editing this slide because

503
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,120
it became too much for me to keep up

504
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,600
with so i encourage you to stay in the

505
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,280
news in the headlines to see what's

506
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,799
going on within the industry

507
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:06,559
okay

508
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,440
now that we know where ot exists how it

509
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,360
impacts us and we've reviewed some

510
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,760
quote-unquote fun cyber attacks that

511
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,720
have occurred over the past 10 years

512
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,880
i'm sure you're probably wondering how

513
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,400
do we define what systems are ot

514
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
well let's run through several system

515
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,080
components here so you can get an

516
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,240
understanding of what is fundamentally

517
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,600
found in manufacturing environments

518
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,679
but before we can do that we really need

519
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,760
to learn about the purdue model

520
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,880
which is

521
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,120
the commonly known as the purdue model

522
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,440
but it is known the purdue enterprise

523
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,000
reference architecture or pera

524
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,559
it was first created in the early 90s by

525
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,039
theodore williams and the purpose of the

526
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,200
model was to define the crucial

527
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,400
infrastructure used in production

528
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,440
when it was

529
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,840
correctly implemented it would achieve

530
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,200
the air gap between it and ot systems

531
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,000
the air the air gap if you don't know is

532
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,320
the physical separation between the

533
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,080
enterprise iot

534
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,399
and the manufacturing ot landscape

535
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,799
the standard purdue model contains six

536
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,280
different levels here so level five

537
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,360
typically used for enterprise devices

538
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,159
this is what you normally use to work on

539
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,400
nothing significant here we have level

540
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,280
3.5 which is known as the demilitarized

541
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,679
zone i always have a very difficult time

542
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,320
pronouncing demilitarized but

543
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,320
i call it the dmz just like everyone

544
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,440
else

545
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,679
level three is typical manufacturing

546
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,960
it's it's for management servers

547
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,120
level two is control systems which can

548
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,080
be very easily found within a specific

549
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,400
site and level one and zero is for

550
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,039
intelligent devices and for the physical

551
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,039
processes which could be

552
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:58,480
uh checking temperature or pressure flow

553
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,559
now that we've reviewed the framework

554
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,960
let's review some of the systems that we

555
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,679
can find within the model of this within

556
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,360
the purdue bottle

557
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,120
so we've got the distributed control

558
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,440
system which is dedicated to systems

559
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,480
manufacturing processes and is typically

560
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,120
found within the chemical water and

561
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,919
nuclear industries but it can be found

562
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,080
a lot more places than that

563
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,880
it is found in layers one or zero of the

564
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,760
purdue model to your left

565
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,000
process control system

566
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,880
is directly monitors and manages an

567
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,520
industrial automation process and

568
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,000
sensors are ingrained into this machine

569
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,840
so it can check pressure flow and

570
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,960
temperature like i mentioned earlier

571
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,559
it can be found

572
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,320
basically everywhere else

573
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,840
and it does reside in layer two or three

574
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,919
the difference here is if it has a

575
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,919
single process that it's monitoring it's

576
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,159
going to be layer 2 but if it is

577
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,480
monitoring multiple processes within a

578
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,720
single site it'll be in layer 3 because

579
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,240
it's going for the management component

580
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,120
there is also the programmable logic

581
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,400
controller

582
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,799
which is what the uh

583
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,039
what it was the triton worm

584
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,760
modified no it was stuxnet sorry too

585
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,679
many attacks to have to remember it was

586
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,880
stuxnet that virus was what um

587
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,880
made the plc uh burn out the centrifuges

588
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,720
because the program was altered

589
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,720
maliciously

590
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,200
you can find the plcs particularly

591
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,919
within steel automotive and chemical and

592
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,360
it resides in layers one or two

593
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,520
and we've got field devices

594
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,919
these contain the sensors so you can do

595
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,520
temperature check humidity and actuators

596
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,320
which will actually implement the change

597
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,279
within the manufacturing process

598
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,799
and there are two different types of

599
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,240
devices here we have basic and smart

600
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,240
we'll focus on the smart because they

601
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,000
are most closely related to the

602
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,120
industrial iot components

603
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,640
they can be found

604
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,760
everywhere

605
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,919
and they are typically reside in layers

606
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,039
two one or zero

607
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,799
like i mentioned earlier i told you i'd

608
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,000
go over the cis it is the system that

609
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,919
directly monitors for specific

610
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,400
conditions and acts to maintain safety

611
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,240
component within the manufacturing

612
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,559
environment we need to make sure that

613
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,440
all of the employees remain safe

614
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,840
osha is not okay with this if it goes or

615
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,720
deviates from any sort of safe nature

616
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,679
this is a system that's critical to that

617
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,760
the role of the cis is to reduce the

618
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,720
risk by implementing safety instrumented

619
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,400
functions

620
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,799
they are very commonly found in high

621
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,200
risk work environments nuclear

622
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,120
refineries chemical

623
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,960
anything you name it and they can be

624
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,440
found in two one or zero of the purdue

625
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,520
model

626
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,520
then we have building automation system

627
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,600
which is one of my favorites

628
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,440
people interact with this a lot more

629
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,520
than they think they can they do

630
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,799
because of building security you have

631
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,919
building safety measures fire water air

632
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,520
conditioning

633
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,279
let's be honest you even have

634
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,679
operational technology or a control

635
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,320
system within your own home if you have

636
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,159
air conditioning which i really hope you

637
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,640
do since it's july and most places are

638
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,080
probably very warm right now

639
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,120
so

640
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,120
with that in mind this kind of

641
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,320
technology at industrial scale

642
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,720
lies in levels two one or zero

643
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,559
since we've run through several common

644
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,360
ics ot components i'm going to go

645
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,039
through some of the differences between

646
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,840
it and ot

647
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,440
at the heart of it all

648
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,360
the systems have different goals and

649
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,559
priorities

650
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,400
keep in mind that the three priorities

651
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,320
listed for each of the technology here

652
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,039
is by no means all-inclusive but does

653
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,880
capture a high-level overview of the

654
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,720
technology

655
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,520
what i mentioned earlier safety top of

656
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,000
mind for ics ot

657
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,840
think back to the triton attack where

658
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,840
the safety instrumentation system

659
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,320
included the unexpected shutdown

660
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,320
if this hadn't been completed safely

661
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,320
this could have put employees in real

662
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,000
danger

663
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,159
then we'd have availability

664
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,240
let's circle back to our previous covet

665
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,880
example if any part of the development

666
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,520
manufacturing and distribution of the

667
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,679
vaccine is halted because of a cyber

668
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:30,640
attack

669
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,960
lives could be at stake

670
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,679
not everything is life for death and ics

671
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,159
ot but if you think about it a large

672
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,400
percentage of the systems could have an

673
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,200
impact on our livelihood

674
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,279
a previous example that we discussed

675
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,840
related to availability is the remote

676
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,320
heart surgery machine what happens if

677
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,080
that machine isn't available to perform

678
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,600
the surgery or quits midway through

679
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,919
and then reliability

680
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,919
reliability and think about the cost

681
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,480
implications that occur when businesses

682
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,279
and production plants are brought down

683
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,400
time is money

684
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,559
so any disruption to the manufacturing

685
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,279
process is inexcusable

686
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,679
a prime example of this is the colonial

687
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,520
pipeline hack that occurred in late

688
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,440
april of this year

689
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,200
the attract has since then been

690
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,120
attributed to a criminal hacker group

691
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,200
called darkseid with the intention of

692
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,880
holding data at ransom or ransomware

693
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,799
the attack was fulfilled through a

694
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,520
compromised password in a legacy vpn

695
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,200
application that didn't have

696
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,960
multi-factor authentication required

697
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,799
a ransom note was identified by a

698
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,039
control room employee which prompted the

699
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,120
pipeline to be removed in order to

700
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,679
contain the potential threat which was

701
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,320
still unknown at that time this is a

702
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,360
prime example of an indirect ics ot

703
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,760
attack because the infrastructure wasn't

704
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,360
the target it was the corporate data

705
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,760
taking the pipeline offline had numerous

706
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,760
consequences some of which we're still

707
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,840
feeling now and not all of them were

708
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,600
just in the southeast but that was where

709
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,679
they were primarily felt

710
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,320
on memorial day weekend the southeast

711
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,200
average cost of gasoline went up 21

712
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,840
cents the national average went up 8

713
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,880
cents

714
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,200
that's 50 percent more than usual on a

715
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,360
memorial day weekend

716
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,000
gas shortages were also reported

717
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,360
57 of gas stations in north carolina

718
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,480
reported outages while 85 in washington

719
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,039
dc had no gas

720
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,080
overall

721
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,720
12 000 gas stations around the country

722
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,840
with went without fuel

723
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,200
next up it i have deliberately put these

724
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,360
out of the typical order that most of us

725
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,120
see

726
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,320
confidentiality integrity and

727
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,919
availability so the cia triad

728
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,159
all of them together i kind of like to

729
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,480
look at it as a bar stool not one of

730
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,440
them is more important than the other

731
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,360
i won't spend too much time here because

732
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,679
i'm i am assuming that a lot of us are

733
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,720
already in the enterprise it environment

734
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,120
so we all understand the importance of

735
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,559
this but integrity is the involvement

736
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,640
and maintenance of consistency and

737
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,720
accuracy of data throughout its

738
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,480
lifecycle

739
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,880
availability is when information should

740
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,600
be consistent and readily accessible for

741
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,919
authorized parties because none of us

742
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,240
like to go online shopping and realize

743
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,720
that our website is down

744
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,279
confidentiality measures are designed to

745
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,440
prevent any unauthorized access attempts

746
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,039
so at a high level ics ot have very

747
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,600
different priorities in mind where they

748
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,480
do share the availability in minds

749
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,720
but one has a much higher risk

750
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,480
implication than the other

751
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,840
so

752
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,320
what are some common risks that are

753
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,000
affiliated with operational technology

754
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,559
as i mentioned earlier networks is a

755
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,080
huge deal

756
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,640
this air gap so the physical separation

757
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,480
between it and ot is monumental and is

758
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,799
actually not done nearly as often as you

759
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,720
would hope

760
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,919
then there is the itot convergence

761
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,480
and this is when

762
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,600
this is when it ot have to have real

763
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,440
time communication

764
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,279
communication and data processing

765
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,200
this makes it difficult

766
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,200
because the entire purpose of it ot

767
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,760
convergence and having uh

768
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,840
my personal cell phone be able to

769
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,720
complete an ot manufacturing task with a

770
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,880
certain amount of authentication

771
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,120
the the network component between those

772
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,240
two can be very difficult to obtain from

773
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,240
different companies

774
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,720
and then we have the issue of remote

775
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,679
access support in ics ot

776
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,640
a lot of the vendor hardware has to be

777
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,600
completed maintenance and support

778
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,600
by the vendor themselves

779
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,120
without this contracts can be broken

780
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,960
and it would and you will never get any

781
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,880
support for those devices

782
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,000
so remote access is very huge within the

783
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,240
network and it is a risk with an ot as

784
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,919
well

785
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,559
we also have assets as i mentioned

786
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,799
earlier we have some networks where the

787
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,600
line between it and ot can be very

788
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,880
blurred

789
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,080
because of iiot infrastructure

790
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,720
for example in 2017

791
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,840
a smart coffee maker was put on the

792
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,960
manufacturing environment

793
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,320
unknowingly

794
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,640
of course uh someone put the smart

795
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,039
coffee maker onto the network uh the

796
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,279
factory engineer went in

797
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,960
after the investigation and the

798
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,279
manufacturing network went down

799
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,360
i would want coffee if i were having the

800
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,840
day that he were having he went into the

801
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,399
coffee maker he noticed that the same

802
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,880
error that was found on his control

803
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,200
system workstation was on the smart

804
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,960
coffee maker

805
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,200
that was when they realized that whoever

806
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,039
installed the smart car free maker put

807
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,440
it directly onto the manufacturing wi-fi

808
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,519
network instead of enterprise

809
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
with all that being said you can't

810
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,840
protect what you don't know what's on

811
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,760
your network

812
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,200
and then legacy requirements ics ot

813
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,600
infrastructure is very commonly known

814
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,039
for using

815
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,679
legacy operating systems because of the

816
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,399
applications that require it weren't

817
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,039
built to be compatible with windows 10.

818
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,039
it might have been windows xps what they

819
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,279
were built to be compatible with

820
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,720
the lifespan of hardware and software

821
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,960
for this kind of infrastructure could be

822
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,480
10 to 20 years in comparison

823
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,840
i.t is maybe one to five years if we're

824
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,158
lucky

825
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,440
this is a challenge because unsupported

826
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,200
operating system applications and

827
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,240
firmware is a huge threat to the network

828
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,640
there is plenty of information out there

829
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,039
on the web on what devices are currently

830
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,279
internet facing what type of device that

831
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,039
we're dealing with and the vendor that

832
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,480
supports it

833
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,559
what ports are and what ports are even

834
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,480
open to that technology might even be

835
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,480
able to be found online as well

836
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,320
and then patching

837
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,519
my favorite

838
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,600
patching becomes a problem because of

839
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,519
the previously mentioned legacy

840
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,080
requirements so we're dealing with all

841
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,799
kinds of legacy operating systems and

842
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:41,279
applications in the environments

843
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,760
the twist of this is that we can't just

844
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,279
shut down like it equipment and patch

845
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,600
and test and update

846
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,279
sometimes there has to be a 99.999

847
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,600
uptime for these devices which almost

848
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,640
entirely eliminates upgrade time

849
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,320
but the good news is ics ot employees

850
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,799
are recognizing this issue and they are

851
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,679
establishing shutdowns and upgrades to

852
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:08,879
complete

853
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,040
however what happens if a zero-day

854
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,719
attack occurs

855
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,280
that's when security and manufacturing

856
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,440
have to convene and determine

857
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,119
what level of risk they're willing to

858
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,159
undergo do they shut down the plant

859
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,679
update

860
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,839
test restart

861
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,639
or do they go along their merry way

862
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,079
knowing that

863
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,719
that is vulnerable but the likelihood of

864
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,638
attack is very minimum

865
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,560
and with that in mind we've got some

866
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,719
steps that we can do in order to

867
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,800
mitigate some of the risks previously

868
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,719
identified

869
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,599
identify your priorities and this is

870
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,639
where a company should ask themselves

871
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,520
where would be the high the area where

872
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,280
there would be a high impact or

873
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,839
likelihood of

874
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:02,960
occurrence it's recommended that you

875
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,280
select priorities and map out their

876
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,920
impacts and select the likelihood of

877
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,640
occurrence when doing with this

878
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,280
and assets like i mentioned earlier you

879
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,599
can't protect what you don't know

880
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,920
unfortunately most of the time asset

881
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,200
identification is going to be a pain

882
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,200
you'll be able to maintain weight once

883
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,280
you have the inventory though you'll be

884
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,280
able to create a process for adding

885
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,200
updating and deleting the asset

886
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,359
inventory

887
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:34,480
but a tricky thing is with it ot

888
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,680
convergence how do you delineate between

889
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,520
it and ot devices

890
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,560
so

891
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,480
knowing your audience is critical when

892
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,119
doing this you have to go up two

893
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,480
different teams be at it and determine

894
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,000
what devices fall in scope of ot

895
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,880
so

896
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,960
i typically ask people

897
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,440
what tasks are completed on your device

898
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,839
what applications you interface with on

899
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,599
a daily basis

900
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,200
do you know what network your device is

901
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,640
connected to

902
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,480
and does your device interface with

903
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,280
manufacturing or quality control labs

904
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,599
some these are all examples of questions

905
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,000
varying experience levels that i ask

906
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,839
users throughout a daily basis to

907
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:22,720
determine if it's an it or an ot device

908
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,640
examples of important attributes you

909
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,560
should have within your asset inventory

910
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,880
are operating system and version

911
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,920
asset owner hardware information and

912
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,119
company unique id

913
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,119
so you got to prioritize your control

914
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,599
areas here whether this be remote access

915
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,599
like i mentioned earlier so that you can

916
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,520
have a safe way for your vendors to

917
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,920
maintain and support your software

918
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,839
endpoint security or network

919
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,480
segmentation you have to prioritize

920
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,040
these and capture the criticality and

921
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,960
should impact which will impact the

922
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,040
product or service for your company the

923
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,040
most

924
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,280
uh this is my favorite one

925
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,280
connecting the right people is a lot

926
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,960
harder than anyone would ever think it

927
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,400
should be

928
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,720
keeping executives and directors in mind

929
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,880
is very important obviously because they

930
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,320
are the ones that gives us the budget

931
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,640
and resources that we need to get our

932
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,079
day done

933
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,079
however they aren't the folks that are

934
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,920
getting everything done on the daily

935
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,040
basis

936
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,200
we need different management brought in

937
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,680
in broughton and getting us in

938
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,440
to the teams that we really need to be

939
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,839
connected with we need the right people

940
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,040
in i.t

941
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,680
automation and engineering

942
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,359
and we need them to work alongside each

943
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,760
other this management team needs to be

944
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,640
very focused on getting the right people

945
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,920
from their teams involved

946
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,680
the right people from their teams that

947
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,440
should be involved are specialty

948
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,720
engineers

949
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,599
and like we mentioned earlier 58

950
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,000
of companies are having issues finding

951
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,560
people with security and manufacturing

952
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,839
experience

953
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,359
but these folks will be the ones

954
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,280
actually responsible for completing the

955
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,480
work throughout the day

956
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,040
and investigation use the asset

957
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,440
inventory that you created and procured

958
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,440
to connect with your network staff and

959
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,839
start mapping out your network i highly

960
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,240
suggest using the purdue model and

961
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,000
acclimating that to your personal

962
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,880
network where you need to

963
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,359
identify the gaps you've connected with

964
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,000
leadership management all kinds of

965
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,400
people at this point i am sure that you

966
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,640
have identified gaps where either you're

967
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,960
communicating not enough

968
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,760
or

969
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,000
the devices you're not sure who the

970
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,720
device owners are for some of them

971
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,720
there's a whole number of issues that

972
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,000
could go wrong

973
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,599
but once you connect with the people

974
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,119
you'll be able to identify that much

975
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,599
easier just keep in mind that you should

976
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,520
keep everything written down so you can

977
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,200
let your management and executive team

978
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,359
know later on

979
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,280
and then processes once you've been

980
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,040
going through this you'll probably see

981
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,599
some similarities and you'll be able to

982
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,960
see exactly how different it ot

983
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,880
processes might be

984
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,520
in my opinion patching processes can be

985
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,480
very similar with role responsibility

986
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,560
but the overall completion of the

987
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,960
process can be very different

988
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,800
you can't just patch and restart

989
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,400
whenever you want like i mentioned

990
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,320
earlier

991
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,280
but access control can be very very

992
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,240
similar

993
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,880
security monitoring and asset management

994
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,720
are all very similar processes between

995
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,520
it and ot so determine which ones that

996
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,800
you can keep

997
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,160
and which ones might need to be slightly

998
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,480
altered

999
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,640
you analyze the vulnerabilities that are

1000
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,400
currently in your landscape at this

1001
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,079
point which is easier said than done

1002
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,480
you also need to prioritize which one of

1003
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,960
these and i highly recommend using the

1004
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,520
common vulnerability scoring system or

1005
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,720
cvss which can help you identify and

1006
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,280
prioritize which vulnerabilities need to

1007
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,240
be fixed first

1008
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,040
there is a caveat some companies do have

1009
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,599
the ability well they do have a slight

1010
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,640
variation to the cvss scoring throughout

1011
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,800
so just keep that in mind as you're

1012
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,960
working

1013
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,400
there might be some machines that are

1014
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,480
also going to be excluded from the

1015
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,200
vulnerability management process

1016
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,160
keep a log get a risk owner involved and

1017
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,560
make sure that mitigation strategies are

1018
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,359
created in order for these devices to do

1019
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:31,520
as little harm if possibly exploited

1020
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,000
and then governance component which is

1021
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,520
always fun

1022
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,000
standardizing all of these controls and

1023
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,160
processes is a huge undertaking

1024
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,040
and

1025
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,520
it's going to be rough long short term

1026
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,280
but long term it's going to be better

1027
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,119
for everyone to get all of the grunt

1028
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,880
work completed

1029
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,880
an important thing is the leadership and

1030
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,359
management teams need to understand how

1031
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:58,160
much time work and collaboration between

1032
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,720
these teams needs to occur

1033
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,640
as i mentioned in the connection phase

1034
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,720
getting the right people involved

1035
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,800
can take weeks sometimes even months

1036
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,720
especially during vacation season like

1037
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,280
it is now you never know

1038
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,200
a communication strategy should

1039
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,280
definitely be implemented to make sure

1040
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,280
that you're talking to the leadership

1041
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,440
management and the engineers within the

1042
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,960
well in a good amount of time you don't

1043
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,640
want to over communicate or under

1044
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,760
communicate

1045
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,520
it's just going to be a work in progress

1046
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,839
and with that in mind we do have

1047
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,760
auditing component as well which i know

1048
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,319
everyone is super thrilled about

1049
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,079
you should have if you have an internal

1050
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,079
auditing component you should definitely

1051
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,200
use that

1052
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,200
if you do not however i would highly

1053
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,040
recommend getting a third party to come

1054
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,160
in and assess to make sure that there is

1055
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,160
no bias that is seeping in throughout

1056
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,279
the auditing process

1057
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,720
so

1058
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,480
i have given you an immense amount of

1059
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,880
information and with that in mind i've

1060
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,000
listed out a few governance items here

1061
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
that you can use and keep in mind with

1062
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,720
the resources of ics ot

1063
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,640
it can be really hard to figure out

1064
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,560
where to start so i would highly

1065
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,480
recommend signing up for the newsletters

1066
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,040
within the governance section provided

1067
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,440
you can get vulnerability alerts

1068
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,920
threat landscape overviews conference

1069
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,920
information and general governance

1070
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,359
updates

1071
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,440
with the numerous resources there's

1072
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,920
always the ability to have a continuous

1073
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,880
improvement i am by no means an expert

1074
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,359
in ics ot like i mentioned it's been

1075
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,560
around for decades and i am in the under

1076
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,079
three year mark

1077
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,640
so i am currently completing an online

1078
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,319
sales course and working to get

1079
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,240
certified by the end of the year in

1080
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,720
operational technology security

1081
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,400
and with the fast-paced environment

1082
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,839
where we're at

1083
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:51,839
we have to keep in touch with everything

1084
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,839
and continuous improvement in learning

1085
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:56,079
is just a given

1086
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,079
for your personal journey if i have

1087
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,240
sparked your interest at all which is a

1088
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,000
big if we'll see

1089
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
i i would highly recommend joining an

1090
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,520
i.t professionals group i coincidentally

1091
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,319
found a beat up group it was global for

1092
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,359
ics ot which linked me to a chapter

1093
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:16,079
within my community as well i'd highly

1094
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,800
recommend that i even found an i.t

1095
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,119
community on next door the other day

1096
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,359
which is just thrilling i

1097
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:24,640
never thought my neighbors would be

1098
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,640
interested in such a thing

1099
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,599
uh there's courseura and udemy i noticed

1100
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,480
that they both have free in for sale

1101
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,680
learning

1102
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,280
for ics ot so i'll also highly recommend

1103
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,599
that as well

1104
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:40,560
and

1105
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,920
with that

1106
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,319
i will open it up to questions i have

1107
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:45,839
not been able to look at the comments

1108
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,680
bar because of my technological

1109
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,440
incompetence in some places so cats do i

1110
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,440
have any questions currently

1111
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,640
um

1112
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,520
so

1113
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,520
far by the way

1114
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,599
great talk i've been

1115
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,160

1116
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,200
down notes because i do iot

1117

to fill out the survey as a speaker

1139

1140
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,839
enough feedback on their talks

1141
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:09,040
especially the positive feedback sure

1142
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,040
people take the time

1143
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,119
when they don't like a talk to go and

1144

you did such an amazing job that you

1151
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:33,839
just kind of left everybody going whoa

1152
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,079
yeah

1153
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,359
well i i have a few opportunities to

1154
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,920
connect i am one of the security

1155
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,560
professionals with the tinfoil hat so i

1156
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,079
am not on snapchat twitter or instagram

1157
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,000
or anything like that but if you do

1158
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,720
happen to have questions um hit me up on

1159
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,800
linkedin or i have my email on the

1160
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,240
presentation as well so okay we did get

1161
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,240
a couple questions let's see keeping an

1162
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,280
inventory seems impossible i know you

1163
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,960
touched on it

1164
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,640
any more tips on keeping an inventory

1165
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,599
so there are actually multiple tools out

1166
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:14,079
there right now i highly recommend doing

1167
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,240
a proof of concept with some of the

1168
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,200
tools uh you can get network

1169
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,960
tools like um

1170
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,240
i know of one armis and it directly

1171
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,720
takes all of your assets that with that

1172
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,720
are within the network vlan where you

1173
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,280
implement it so it'll take all of the

1174
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,599
traffic and assets via there

1175
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,160
but at this point the best thing i can

1176
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,800
give to you is to try out one of the

1177
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,760
tools reach out to a vendor and see what

1178
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,000
you can start gathering without having

1179
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,319
to contact some of the people at sites

1180
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:48,400
once you get into

1181
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,720
various manufacturing sites you get into

1182
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,400
spreadsheets and

1183
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,599
it can get ugly real fast

1184
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,839
hey really quick could you put your

1185
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:01,520
linkedin um id in the in the chat yeah

1186
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,800
yeah absolutely yeah let me do that

1187
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,359
um we did get another question is

1188
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:10,240
creating or using air gapped networks

1189
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,720
still done and considered safe

1190
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:16,319
um

1191
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,880
it is still done so the purdue model is

1192
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,520
definitely the the better reference here

1193
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,520
um

1194
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,839
there is dmz you could there is a way

1195
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:28,880
that you can proxy traffic and and

1196
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,440
segment networks but like i mentioned

1197
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,440
the it ot gov

1198
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,839
convergence has made it incredibly

1199
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:37,520
difficult so

1200
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,720
the easiest route is to make devices

1201
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,280
separate for it and ot

1202
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,800
keeping the networks and having

1203
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,200
completely separate networks not even

1204
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,640
i'm talking separate vlans i am saying

1205
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,480
absolutely separated

1206
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,720
so it is possible

1207
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,520
like i said i am also

1208
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,599
three years into it i am talking to

1209
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,200
industry professionals and still

1210
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,760
learning on an hourly basis

1211
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,000
so i encourage you i've got a lot of

1212
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,760
links in this presentation to do your

1213
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,599
own research but

1214
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:12,160
absolutely it's possible it's just gonna

1215
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,760
be there's gonna be a little hell to pay

1216
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,400
um will you be posting your slides

1217
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,880
yes i actually i can't is there a

1218
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,040
preferable method i think i posted it on

1219
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,880
schedule but that was probably just for

1220
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,920
speakers if it is no if it's on sched um

1221
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,440
people should be able to get to it

1222
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,680
um

1223
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,319
