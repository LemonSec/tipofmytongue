intelligence pros

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,920
home hobbyists huge organizations and

39
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,400
their teams across like every level of

40
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,159
threat intelligence maturity and we'll

41
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,840
get into a little bit about like what

42
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,520
maturity looks like and what that

43
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,000
current landscape is within uh security

talent from all walks of life into this

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000

becoming quickly integrated across the

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
entire security environment

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,560

attack very important the attack

69
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,760
framework

70
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,400
and finally a quick note i was talking

71
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,000
to somebody earlier who's like you can't

send emojis in the chat you actually can

73
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,319
and that could be kind of fun if you

74
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,640

feel free to send them throughout this

78
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,760
session

79
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,360
as part of my job because i work within

80
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,599
a threat intelligence data and platform

81
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,800
vendor space i'm talking to people at

82
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,319
all levels all the time they're

83
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,640
researchers they're from academia

84
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,800
they're from um

85
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,879
government groups they're from you know

86
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,720
commercial sectors as well and they're

87
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,959
all across the world and so i get this

88
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,040
really unique perspective talking and

89
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,120
listening to their issues and then also

90
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,519
seeing what makes teams successful what

91
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,440
kind of investments what kind of skills

92
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,680
really help grow individual careers as

93
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,480
well as grow cti programs and so part of

94
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,159
that is oh and i see a lot of people are

95
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,040
sending emojis yeah looking good

96
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,799
part of that is bringing it back to the

97
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,480
audience of folks who might not have

98
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,480
access to this type of information

99
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,239
and if we step back like

100
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,720
why why talk about cti careers like why

101
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,959
does the diana initiative you know try

102
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,760
to invite different folks to learn about

103
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,640
security blue team purple team grc red

104
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,440
team

105
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,480
and this is something that is related to

106
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,280
and any new project any new initiative

107
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,879
you're taking on

108
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,519
stage one uninformed optimism

109
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,280
that's when let's say somebody's looking

110
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,280
to pivot in their career and that all

111
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,879
they see are blue skies they're just so

112
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,519
excited you know cyber pays well uh you

113
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,360
get to really make an impact what you're

114
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,360
doing helps protect organizations and

115
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,360
helps protect citizenry and you know you

116
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,879
can learn and it's a great field which

117
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,040
it is 100 it is but you don't know

118
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,880
everything that's going on and then you

119
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,880
start to get involved and then you move

120
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,120
into stage two and that's informed

121
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,960
pessimism you're starting to see a lot

122
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,440
of barriers everything feels hard the

123
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,440
benefits of you know what you've tried

124
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,600
to take on move further and further away

125
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,520
and unfortunately i also see a lot of

126
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,600
people getting really frustrated feeling

127
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,639
like they cannot really start to grab

128
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,880
onto a cti career or they're applying to

129
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,720
a lot of jobs they're not able to get it

130
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,880
they're inundated with pressures to get

131
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,520
a lot of certs or other qualifications

132
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,040
and that's where you get into stage

133
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,520
three that's the valley of despair and

134
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,040
what i like to unprofessionally call the

135
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,840
big sad that's where you are almost

136
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,400
burnt out you feel nothing but impostor

137
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,880
syndrome you really are like i can't

138
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,160
continue

139
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,680
there's no way i'm gonna make it past

140
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,960
this um i'm it's it's too difficult i

141
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,199
don't get it um and then that's where a

142
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,800
lot of people might quit and repeat

143
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,639
phase one through three where you try

144
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,160
something else and you either do push

145
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,520
through or you don't

146
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,759
the talk here today is to equip you with

147
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,360
some knowledge some advice some

148
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,680
frameworks about how to look at a threat

149
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,120
intelligence career if it's interesting

150
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,199
to you so you don't quite dip that low

151
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,120
in the valley of despair

152
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,240
um

153
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,840
i saw somebody just say that the valley

154
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,600
of despair is real yeah it is and this

155
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,360
isn't just for your career could be when

156
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,720
you start a new job could be when you

157
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,479
start a new hobby could be

158
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,080
your attempt at getting healthier and

159
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,400
exercise and it's really important to

160
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,160
understand where you are in these mental

161
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,320
states and also get resources to help

162
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,240
you so that you can get to informed

163
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,199
optimism that's stage four more quickly

164
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,039
that's where you understand

165
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,000
what priorities you need what work you

166
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,160
need what effort you have to put in and

167
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,360
you're starting to feel like you're

168
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,120
getting there you're able to contribute

169
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,639
you're able to teach yourself and make

170
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,560
an impact in your organization or

171
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,319
protect your home environment whatever

172
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,360
that is

173
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,919
and then uh stage five which is you know

174
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,160
nirvana that's where you have found

175
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,160
success and you feel like you're

176
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,479
fulfilled that you have a purpose and

177
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,560
this happens at micro and macro levels

178
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,840
too and every time you bring on

179
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,400
something you can and you may go through

180
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,720
all of these stages so once again when

181
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,479
we're talking about all this you don't

182
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,400
have to feel pressured to remember

183
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,440
everything you don't have to take

184
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,280
screenshots or crazy notes but feel free

185
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,560
if you do

186
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,319
it's just so that you might take enough

187
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,000
nuggets of knowledge out of here so that

188
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,240
you can guide your path and you could

189
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,400
understand what to be worried about what

190
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,240
not to be worried about what foundations

191
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,319
you need to have in place

192
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,039
kaya yes uh lots of emojis i threw these

193
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,560
in actually last night because i thought

194
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,600
it was just a little bit more

195
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,199
interesting in the presentation

196
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,599
so today getting into the nitty-gritty

197
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,000
cyber threat intelligence 101

198
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,840
what the cti stand for

199
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,479
cti in action just an example of what a

200
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:01,599
day

201
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,520
what a program what your job in cti

202
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,319
looks like and then tips and resources

203
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,840
just some things to leave you off with

204
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,080
some hyperlinks we can also send out in

205
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,160
the chat as well i might be able to post

206
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,000
the comment uh later when we get to that

207
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,080
point

208
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,960
a quick snapshot of the audience

209
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,680
how familiar are you with cti and feel

210
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,840
free i'll give you a few seconds just to

211
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,120
send in you know

212
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,400
you don't even know what it stands for

213
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,479
or like maybe you took a course or maybe

214
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,479
took a general course that had like

215
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,360
one day of cti um or you know it's your

216
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,120
job you could you could honestly be

217
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,000
presenting it right now alongside me

218
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,759
so go ahead and type that in the chat

219
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,720
i'm seeing some comments coming in

220
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,800
and while we wait

221
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,479
i'm going to show you i mentioned

222
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,479
earlier and i want to live up to it i do

223
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,319
a lot of crafts in my spare time like

224
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,319
non-digital get away from the screen

225
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,960
refresh my mind so i have plants but

226
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,639
they're not living plants so while we're

227
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,879
doing this first poll

228
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,800
this is my plants versus zombie plant

229
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
these are actually perler beads that i

230
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,960
created in a little pot

231
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,520
this is the bean shooter peashooter p

232
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,520
peashooter and this is the sunflower

233
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,879
that you can buy more plants with in

234
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,560
plants for a zombie so they sit on my

235
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,400
windowsill at home

236
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,759
all right

237
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,440
just looking around are you doing a

238
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,840
little in your job very familiar

239
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,599
following and reading along took a

240
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,039
general course somewhat familiar perfect

241
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,120
exactly the right audience

242
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,840
so moving in let's get into a mind meld

243
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,479
what are some key words related to the

244
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,958
definition of cyber threat intelligence

245
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,958
that you might have been familiar with

246
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,360
that you think are relevant

247
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,039
um that you've learned about in your

248
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,200
studies

249
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,120
so i'm seeing you know security

250
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,839
operation center people using cti yep

251
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,120
yep

252
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,760
i see people now are loving the plant um

253
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,880
i'll show you actually i'll show you

254
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,800
another one while we're here

255
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,920
um

256
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,760
there's taking course threat hunting yes

257
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,360
of course

258
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,920
i'll show you a small one this time

259
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,320
i also get into miniatures because they

260
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,760
don't take up that much space but they

261
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,519
take up a lot of time which is a great

262
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,320
uh hobby during covid

263
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,399
so here's a tiny i don't know if my

264
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,880
camera looks good or not tiny little

265
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,720
potted plant

266
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,600
and then here's a tiny little

267
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,720
i don't even know what they're called

268
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,680
does anybody know what this is

269
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,959
a little bead

270
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,880
and i have little cafes and stuff in my

271
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,440
house shelves full of these things

272
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,920
all right checking out chat now

273
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,390
um

274
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,440
[Music]

275
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,080
ioc's of course indicators of compromise

276
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,360
threat actors threat groups apts

277
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,040
behavior

278
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,560
c and c so infrastructure yes excellent

279
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,560
all of that is related

280
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,560
so let's define cyber threat

281
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,760
intelligence

282
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,240
i'm going to go to uh gartner who's you

283
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,560
know one of the big voices on the block

284
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,120
and their their definition

285
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,360
it's evidence-based knowledge including

286
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,680
context mechanisms

287
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,040
indicators

288
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,920
implications and action-oriented advice

289
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,160
about an existing or emerging menace or

290
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,160
hazard to assets

291
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,040
okay

292
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,519
this intelligence can be used to inform

293
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,519
decisions regarding the subject's

294
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,920
response to that menace or hazard so in

295
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,079
cyber their intelligence it's all cyber

296
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,519
security related

297
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,800
every vendor

298
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,720
every single kind of

299
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,320
group might define it a little bit

300
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,560
differently but if we boil it down it

301
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,480
ends up being data that becomes

302
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,320
contextualized that informs action

303
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,480
steps things to do

304
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,320
and one thing i really want to debunk

305
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,360
right now

306
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,880
is what cti isn't in this space and in

307
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,880
security a lot of people tend to

308
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,600
conflate just technology with

309
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,800
whatever that domain is so cti is not

310
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,640
just having a notebook a dossier with

311
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,560
every threat group or apt

312
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,120
it's not consuming every expensive feed

313
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,040
or free feed

314
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,040
and having every tool in-house

315
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,800
it's not even

316
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,720
having a dedicated team member or

317
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,240
provider

318
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,839
and it's not ingesting every indicator

319
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,000
every ioc that you can find and it's not

320
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
oh sinting all the things either and the

321
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,920
most important of all when you're moving

322
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,920
into this career or you're just talking

323
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,079
to people about cti it's never set it

324
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,680
and forget it that's something that i

325
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,920
have to remind users

326
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,000
clients prospects all the time

327
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,560
cti is so inherently ingrained in an

328
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,560
organization in their thread landscape

329
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,959
that over time you are optimizing but

330
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,800
it's never like let me turn some things

331
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,560
on let me get some workflows going and

332
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,800
then okay great it's just working the

333
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,880
threat landscape is changing every day

334
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,360
that actors are changing um your own

335
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,519
environment is changing and that in and

336
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,240
of itself is important and intelligence

337
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,480
in regards to that is also changing all

338
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,880
the time

339
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,120
to provide some context about cti's

340
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,399
discipline

341
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,200
sam's institute has been doing a cti

342
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,040
survey every year and so i pulled in

343
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,120
some data from their 2021 survey and

344
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,040
they've had five years of history here

345
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,880
which is great

346
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,040
does your organization produce or

347
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,399
consume cti so five years ago sixty

348
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,639
percent of the surveyed respondents

349
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,240
replied yes

350
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,480
either producing internally consuming

351
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,240
threat intelligence it's part of kind of

352
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,480
their security posture

353
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,720
over time that number has gone all gone

354
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,399
all the way to 85 percent and that's

355
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,040
that's a pretty significant majority

356
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,920
on the other end 25 percent five years

357
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,240
ago had said not yet but we're planning

358
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,560
to it's somewhere on the horizon we know

359
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,240
it's important we just need our budget

360
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,160
we need our time we need somebody who

361
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,920
can come in house and really help us

362
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,079
operationalize that number has dropped

363
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,440
down to 15

364
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,200
which is the entire remaining amount of

365
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,760
respondents so what does that mean the

366
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,880
15

367
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,360
left over from 2017 that had no plans

368
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,839
didn't care and no cti for us no thank

369
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,000
you that went to zero so everyone's

370
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,600
changed their tune so either they are

371
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,920
now involved in some level of cti

372
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,639
production consumption or they have it

373
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,200
on their plans

374
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,360
when it comes to being a cti

375
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,560
practitioner

376
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,120
where do teams exist right

377
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,720
pretty standard for the rest of the

378
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,399
industry but there's a lot of vendors

379
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,200
out there who produce cti who have cti

380
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,040
tooling a lot of times they are doing a

381
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,800
lot of cutting edge research and they're

382
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,399
both startups and very large

383
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,079
organizations

384
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,360
there's consulting so mssps manage

385
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,320
detection teams cti specific teams so

386
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,079
they are professional services that work

387
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,240
with many clients to help them get their

388
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,560
cti in order

389
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,440
there's government groups as well for

390
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,240
local state federal

391
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,839
and there's institutional academic

392
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,000
health care nonprofit for-profit and

393
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,680
finally commercial that includes

394
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,320
enterprise finance probably has some of

395
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,040
the best well-known fusion centers and

396
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,880
there's also manufacturing supply chain

397
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,600
just really any commercial sector

398
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,000
they all have different levels of cyber

399
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,600
threat intelligence ingrained in their

400
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,560
security programs

401
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,040
now who and where right like how does

402
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,839
that look in a

403
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,320
company going back into the 2021 cti

404
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,399
survey by sans institute

405
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,040
most organizations have formal dedicated

406
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,880
teams or at least some sort of shared

407
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,320
responsibility across security groups um

408
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,480
so

409
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,680
overall if you look 55

410
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,959
56

411
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,959
have a combination that means some

412
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,600
in-house maybe some external services

413
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,000
professional services providing uh

414
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,639
context information uh

415
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,839
finished intelligence for them

416
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,040
the in-house segment is 36.5 but that

417
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,360
has grown five percent in the last year

418
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,199
so that means that more organizations

419
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,120
are bringing more talent like purely

420
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,959
in-house to work on cyber threat

421
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,320
intelligence

422
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,519
and about 7.5 are just pure service

423
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,279
providers so kind of like outsource

424
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,880
consultants providing threat

425
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,360
intelligence and honestly i don't know

426
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,680
what that like point zero one percent

427
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,680
others but uh feel free to put your best

428
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,479
guess in the chat

429
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,480
and as far as the users and the

430
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,480
contributors to threat intelligence in

431
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,560
the ideal world it's across the entire

432
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,199
organization but most commonly right now

433
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,920
it's found in security operations teams

434
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,839
there are cti teams

435
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,519
often too you'll see it involved in

436
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,279
incident response or vulnerability

437
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,839
management moving out from there

438
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,519
risk and compliance sometimes when

439
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,440
they're doing assessments and audits uh

440
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,199
cti can come into play

441
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,360
executives and leaderships even if

442
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,399
they're not necessarily uh cyber focused

443
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,920
they need under an understanding of

444
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,600
their threat landscape and what actions

445
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,199
what budgeting you know how to plan

446
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,680
moving ahead in their strategic roadmap

447
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,160
and as well as other business units

448
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,279
in addition

449
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,720
customers and end users play an

450
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,040
important part as well as red teams and

451
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,160
different abuse research

452
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,320
cti at this current moment is not really

453
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
an entry-level job you can take some

454
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,720
classes you can do a ton of research

455
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,320
but very very very often uh cti is a

456
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,040
specialization maybe like two three four

457
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,600
five plus years down the line and they

458
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,839
can come from security operations

459
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,880
security consulting um digital forensics

460
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,720
and incident response is a very popular

461
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,800
kind of feeder role into a cyber threat

462
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,440
intelligence-specific uh career

463
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,000
and also security engineering and system

464
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,160
administration too people from it often

465
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,160
find themselves in cti

466
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,839
and two other

467
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,880
less traditional paths um government and

468
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,360
military intelligence and wow i'm

469
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,360
getting an absolute downpour hopefully

470
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,720
you can't hear that but if you do let me

471
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,759
know and i'll try to adjust my audio

472
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,759
military intelligence they're very

473
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,759
familiar with socio-political

474
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,560
geopolitical information and creating

475
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,199
important reports so that translates

476
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,959
very well into cyber threat intelligence

477
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,599
as well and finally technology reporting

478
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,839
so being able to understand technology

479
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,319
find sources right information for a

480
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,480
specific audience that in and of itself

481
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,480
is a great skill to have and so you'll

482
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,400
see all the different kind of components

483
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,760
of those jobs

484
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,359
the skill sets that work really well for

485
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,720
threat intelligence are writing and

486
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,119
reporting technical research

487
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,080
digital forensics networking scripting

488
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,320
is always always a plus but not

489
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,120
necessary and data analysis

490
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,679
it does not mean that you need to do all

491
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,760
of those things but kind of out of the

492
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,160
box they all are immediately useful in a

493
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,280
cyber threat intelligence role

494
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,200
i saw somebody in chat mention that you

495
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,960
know they did research couldn't really

496
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,440
find entry-level jobs it's true

497
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,280
sometimes they do have

498
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,280
security analyst roles that have a focus

499
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,880
on threat intelligence and if you have

500
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,039
some ocean kind of skills or some

501
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,880
projects you've done it helps but

502
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,760
typically typically threatened hell is

503
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,440
something that happens a little further

504
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,880
down in a cyber career

505
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,720
and so now we talk about like currently

506
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,720
like what's happening right

507
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,480
even when i put this slide together a

508
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,160
while ago i mean it's only it's only

509
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,000
gotten worse and it this is not about

510
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,880
fud at all it's just there's double

511
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,600
extortion taking place where not only

512
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,120
you know do you have ransomware and

513
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,559
everything you have encrypted and you

514
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,480
know you do or you don't pay up but then

515
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,480
your private information sensitive

516
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,960
information may be leaked um hackers are

517
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,640
working for hire there's affiliate

518
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,720
groups and they're really coalescing as

519
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,919
like a legitimate business um enterprise

520
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,440
where you know their subscription

521
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,720
services and they're growing more

522
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,960
sophisticated in their capabilities as

523
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,480
well as you know

524
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,000
there's just a lot of vulnerabilities a

525
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,919
lot of gaps a lot of targets that are

526
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:50,720
open

527
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,400
and there's just massive growth on both

528
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,880
sides and so threat intelligence it's

529
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,480
it's not going away i think it will

530
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,520
evolve over time but truly and this

531
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,120
graph shows you just the number of leaks

532
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,280
that's even just one slice of the puzzle

533
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,200
here the number of leaks that took place

534
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,039
in 2020.

535
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,440
so the job so your career in threat

536
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,360
intelligence why

537
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,280
your job includes understanding that

538
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,559
means you have to have a really good

539
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,000
grasp on the context of your

540
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,799
organization your security the strategy

541
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,960
that you need moving forward

542
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,880
you need to do right those are the

543
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,240
things you're familiar with you're

544
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,480
mitigating you're detecting you're

545
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,840
protecting

546
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,000
you need to optimize always need to be

547
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,280
thinking about how you can improve

548
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,039
things over time how to get the right

549
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,280
resources and operationalize and build

550
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,600
your priorities and you know at the end

551
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,799
of the day like everything else in

552
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,240
security you're protecting the bottom

553
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,400
line whether that's

554
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,080
personal private information whether

555
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,240
that's finance whether that's helping

556
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,919
the business keep going and keep growing

557
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,840
and so the intelligence cycle underlies

558
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,520
the entire discipline right of cyber

559
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,600
threat intelligence the tools all just

560
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,760
support different parts of the cycle the

561
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,320
the staff are helping apply the cycle

562
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,640
into uh the different organizations they

563
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,760
work for

564
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,360
and so i'm going to try not to get too

565
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,679
light jargony here and just keep it fun

566
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,360
but walk through what each stage of this

567
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,360
means and really at the end of the day

568
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,760
this is relevant to many different

569
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,919
careers as well just the process of

570
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,159
planning collection processing analysis

571
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,080
and sharing information back

572
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,080
planning

573
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,000
you start with

574
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,600
what do we care about

575
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,440
why do we care about it

576
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,280
you're setting a purpose you're setting

577
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,240
your scope of your project of your job

578
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,240
you're conducting stakeholder interviews

579
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,919
the people who will care who will be

580
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,919
doing things with intelligence you're

581
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,679
setting core objectives you're learning

582
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,760
how to measure uh you're understanding

583
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,360
your goals and what tasks you might be

584
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,600
setting up with kpis key performance

585
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,080
indicators and you're also understanding

586
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,640
the current risk landscape your users

587
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,559
your consumers and also your

588
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,240
capabilities what you can and you can't

589
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,840
do and what you need to start

590
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,159
doing then you move into collection

591
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,640
that's where you have both internal and

592
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,240
external sources

593
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,000
you might be familiar with this there's

594
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,720
network logs past incidents you might be

595
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,760
getting risk analysis reports internally

596
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,840
externally you might be consuming threat

597
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,960
feeds

598
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,360
just reading blogs or scraping twitter

599
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,200
for iocs right

600
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,200
you might be looking at ttps collected

601
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,440
from vendors on both the open and the

602
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,080
dark web and so what the collection

603
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,640
phase is all about is what data do we

604
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,600
need and from where

605
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,799
but data in and of itself is not enough

606
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,960
like what does a single license plate

607
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,320
mean if you're at a store and you're

608
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,760
trying to protect against criminal

609
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,840
activity it doesn't help so what you

610
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,799
need to do

611
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,679
to go from there is to process

612
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,760
processing includes enrichment and

613
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,679
contextualization

614
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,919
you're taking a little data point an

615
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,679
alert a log an ioc an ioc can be a url

616
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,840
an ip a domain a hash

617
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,280
and you're finding more information

618
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,039
about it you're looking at the narrative

619
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,200
you're doing a correlation as well so

620
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,280
that's you can find things from ocean

621
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,480
engines

622
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,679
different a lot of different tools out

623
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,760
there you can conduct scanning um you

624
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,840
can do footprinting you can also conduct

625
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,120
human intelligence and social

626
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,960
engineering go out into forums you know

627
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,640
you have an informant who can tell you

628
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,080
more information about what they see and

629
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,080
what they know and that also includes

630
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,679
trust groups asking people who've been

631
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,840
doing work uh related to something what

632
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,159
they know and having you know like uh

633
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,559
private shared conversations

634
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,720
and that moves into analysis

635
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,200
within analysis you're then creating

636
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,600
intelligence and this requires a lot of

637
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,799
sophisticated strategic work you're now

638
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,000
sussing out you're building out motives

639
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,360
targets behaviors uh impact right how

640
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,760
much does this matter what is at risk

641
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,360
and then from there you're producing

642
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,679
actionable reports informed narratives

643
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,200
to then protect your organization or

644
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,280
protect whatever you're protecting and

645
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,960
inform decision making and next steps so

646
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,320
that's like

647
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,320
like what recommendations do you put in

648
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,400
place what needs to get done right now

649
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,000
what needs to be in budget next time

650
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,360
because you know this is something that

651
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,559
is high risk

652
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,200
and so the the key point here is out of

653
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,960
all that collection all those data

654
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,799
points and all the context you get

655
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,159
sometimes it's relevant sometimes it's

656
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,640
not so helpful what matters why and to

657
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,200
whom which audiences need to know

658
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,039
and this is the final point which is

659
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,480
there's a lot of really interesting

660
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,080
conversations in threat intelligence

661
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,360
right now about sharing and the

662
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,000
importance of effectively sharing your

663
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,280
intelligence

664
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,880
this is dissemination and then getting

665
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,480
feedback so that you can iterate and

666
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,320
improve next time

667
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,159
you have to select your format your

668
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,640
output how timely when and where you're

669
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,559
going to bring this up what meeting or

670
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,039
what email and the distribution of

671
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,200
intelligence is it public is it private

672
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,880
is it only to executives is it to your

673
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,279
security engineering team with clear

674
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,360
actions and considerations

675
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,440
context that these audiences need to

676
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,559
know about

677
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,640
plus uh just like feedback getting

678
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,240
feedback what was useful what isn't

679
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,159
because you need to improve over time

680
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,640
and this strives at who needs to know

681
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,720
about what you just created and what do

682
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,320
they need to understand what do they

683
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,120
need to walk away with understanding and

684
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,000
this means you sometimes have a whole

685
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,039
breadth of research that's done and one

686
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,799
group might only need the headline

687
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,559
another group might need all of the

688
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,159
technical mitigation measures that need

689
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:25,919
to be taken place another group might

690
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,000
need a write-up in a different format

691
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,480
and this is absolutely essential and

692
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,559
then the entire cycle starts back again

693
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,320
if you read you know any of the major

694
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,000
vendor blogs they're a great place to

695
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,840
start just to familiarize yourself with

696
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,240
like what how do they determine a target

697
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,159
how do they determine motive how do they

698
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,720
determine uh ttps tactics techniques and

699
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,960
procedures of a threat group but it can

700
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,760
feel very

701
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,880
far away very distant so just a short

702
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,480
quick example of what threat

703
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,240
intelligence looks like even for just a

704
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,600
regular you know you me home hobbyist

705
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,679
in 2020 we were getting a lot of really

706
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,559
weird links uh that includes related to

707
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,640
you know covid related to vaccines

708
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,240
related to ppe

709
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,720
and uh sometimes including yours truly

710
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,799
you get stuff from family members or

711
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,480
friends or you know

712
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,240
older folks who might just be like

713
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,159
sending links out and it might sound

714
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,159
really scary and so

715
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,600
a lot of times if you see those links

716
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,960
like internally you know something's

717
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,799
wrong and you've already assessed that

718
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,799
what matters to you is you know your

719
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,000
financials uh your private information

720
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,919
of course your credentials so if you see

721
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,919
one of these links if you go off into an

722
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,279
ocean tool

723
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,960
i'm just showing postdoc because i you

724
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,480
know i know it's safe to use i won't get

725
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,799
in trouble to showcase this example if

726
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,320
you plug it in you might be able to pull

727
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,799
context here some some information like

728
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,640
screenshots or if they're using a meta

729
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,799
description for facebook which was true

730
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,039
in this case and you know that that's

731
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,799
being suspicious you know that something

732
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,240
there is wrong and they might be trying

733
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,799
to steal passwords for what reason you

734
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,640
can do more research or you can just say

735
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,000
like it's likely that you can take your

736
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,520
stuff maybe try to get money out of

737
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,240
people you know pretend to be you um see

738
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,600
what other information they can get

739
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,919
right pivot within your environment to

740
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,880
uh further further provide a text

741
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,159
and so

742
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,520
now that you've done some processing you

743
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,279
know just like a little bit you want to

744
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,360
disseminate that information you go out

745
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,120
you tell your friends if you saw this

746
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,880
don't click it first of all don't click

747
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,480
it don't use it this is dangerous make

748
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,799
sure you block it uh if you think there

749
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,159
might be something change your password

750
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,240
immediately that's you providing a

751
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,640
report in a very light way of course to

752
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,840
your friends and family that's you

753
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,840
giving action items and so that's like

754
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,240
kind of the smallest microcosm example

755
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,320
of threat intelligence at work and of

756
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,000
course you can report it to registrars

757
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,240
or reported to open fish and they will

758
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,400
also take more actions to help protect

759
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,279
you know the community

760
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,480
going back into the kind of high level

761
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,320
large cti teams there's a huge variety

762
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,159
of maturity levels

763
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,440
on one side there's cti on a budget

764
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,799
that's the photo of a college you know

765
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,600
microwave and fridge where

766
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,440
maybe a team that doesn't have that many

767
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,600
security resources has somebody who's

768
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,360
like an analyst or even an i.t person

769
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,120
who's starting to look at intelligence

770
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,279
try to do more research try to write

771
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,960
reports and respond to requests for

772
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,360
information and that's cti in a budget

773
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,279
they're kind of going with free tools

774
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,679
you wear a lot of hats um definitely

775
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,440
starting to build out resources trying

776
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,159
just to understand what you need at all

777
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,840
there's a lot of people out there in the

778
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,840
commercial space as well as in you know

779
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,360
other spaces

780
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,520
a lot in the middle this is the kind of

781
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,440
a mess where it's like collect them all

782
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,880
but maybe don't operationalize

783
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,960
everything there's a lot of tools

784
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,799
there's some standards there's some

785
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,799
workflows in place but at the end of the

786
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,200
day it's very disjointed because there

787
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,760
are so many new tools taking place new

788
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,279
functionalities

789
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,600
and teams are having trouble finding out

790
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,279
how to integrate it properly how to get

791
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,440
the most value out of all their tools or

792
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,799
if they're collecting a lot of feeds how

793
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,640
to de-noise that right make sure they

794
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,640
don't get false positives and reduce

795
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,480
also false negatives which means you're

796
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,240
not getting alert on every single ip

797
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,279
that comes in but you're also not

798
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,440
missing anything too important

799
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,679
and then on the last side yes there are

800
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,919
some very mature fusion centers they

801
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,919
usually hire uh

802
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,720
very robust teams very very specialized

803
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,799
skill sets they have a lot of great

804
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,360
tools and they also have just a lot of

805
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,960
investment in and that's kind of the

806
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,799
iron chef kitchen where they know

807
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,559
you know it's not a solved problem but

808
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,320
they're creating a lot of intelligence

809
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,159
for the community they're processing a

810
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,960
lot of data and uh if you ever have the

811
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,640
chance to work somewhere like that it's

812
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,399
really great too because you get to see

813
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,679
what the top of the industry looks like

814
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,200
at the bottom i just

815
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,200
peppered in some terminology that you

816
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,240
might see

817
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,279
it's messy um don't feel too overwhelmed

818
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,679
trying to understand everything

819
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,320
like security as an overall domain

820
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,159
i will tell you even in trust groups

821
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,000
where they're just the smartest people

822
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,440
you know they don't know everything

823
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,760
they're focused on uh one sector or a

824
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,320
certain threat actor group or certain

825
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,840
technologies or certain types of

826
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,760
exploits or certain type of attacks they

827
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,279
don't know everything either and that

828
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,600
that's where really sharing intelligence

829
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,960
is very important and knowing what

830
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,279
network of trusted partners you have can

831
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,640
help a lot in the threat intelligence

832
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,279
space so not working early and often so

833
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,600
you know what sources to be looking at

834
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,960
or you know where to be sharing

835
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,559
intelligence as you're getting it that

836
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,320
might help another group or you know

837
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,320
somebody they used to work with

838
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,559
very critical

839
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,679
the technology standpoint which is you

840
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,919
know not and all be all

841
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,720
but right now very commonly in an

842
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,480
example flow there's a lot of

843
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,640
intelligence so that could be domains or

844
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,760
ips urls vulnerabilities and also news

845
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,480
and enviro advisories unstructured data

846
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,960
going in a threat intelligence platform

847
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,080
is a pretty common way to dedupe to

848
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,919
enrich to correlate and just kind of

849
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:04,799
start

850
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,559
processing that intelligence and then

851
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,799
having analysts manage that actively to

852
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,039
curate it for an organization

853
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,279
but that's not always the case um i have

854
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,520
talked to some folks who have their

855
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,760
intelligence in excel sheets lots and

856
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,440
lots of excel sheets very large excel

857
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,399
sheets

858
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,039
in slideshows and you know it's a little

859
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,120
bit painful but i've also heard that

860
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,039
they kind of have intelligence but it's

861
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,200
just living in email threads but it

862
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,120
quickly does outgrow that once you're

863
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,279
starting to really collect and and look

864
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,720
at you know past information um

865
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,279
i see some okay tim thank you so much

866
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,799
for sending some uh definitions out

867
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,720
and then from there you know the threat

868
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,640
intelligence platform is your database

869
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,720
your analytics layer for managing your

870
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,480
threat intelligence but you know how

871
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,399
where does that operationalize of course

872
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,480
you're writing reports you're sending

873
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,039
advisories out but you can also push

874
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,760
your intelligence uh block lists uh

875
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,240
automatically enrich indicators or

876
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,399
alerts with indicators in your security

877
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,720
information and event management system

878
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,480
and that's correlation that's detection

879
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,039
and that's alerting and also like more

880
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,640
recent years source security

881
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,919
orchestration automation response

882
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,760
moving forward what do you expect um

883
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,519
there's nothing mind-blowing here but if

884
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,960
you're looking at a career in threat

885
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,159
intelligence if you're looking to move

886
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,360
into the space i have a couple um

887
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,200
findings from just talking to a lot of

888
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,720
individuals

889
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,559
one continued growth that's why i'm here

890
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,000
talking to you there's gonna be more

891
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,960
training

892
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,360
more investment uh

893
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,320
from

894
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,000
across the board and from the board

895
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,200
that's my cheek way of saying like

896
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,440
leadership is going to require

897
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,519
threat intelligence the ability to know

898
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,279
reports the ability of you know your

899
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,640
threat landscape

900
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,919
and then also

901
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,760
as far as the marketplace new

902
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,480
technologies coming out and a lot of uh

903
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,480
market consolidation m a there's some

904
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,480
really large news recently too about

905
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,840
some threat intelligence platforms that

906
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,000
were being acquired

907
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,240
another piece is investment towards

908
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,799
hybrid semi-automated processes and

909
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,720
that's not replacing an analyst not

910
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,880
replacing a cti researcher by any means

911
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,399
but it's just helping with the

912
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,720
monotonous work so that's correlation

913
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,039
deduplication the integration and

914
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,240
automation from getting your steps done

915
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,919
and also in dissemination of your

916
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,480
intelligence

917
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,159
next and this is really exciting

918
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:29,519
refinement on threat intelligence

919
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,519
requirements so that definition that

920
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,600
curation the last five years there's a

921
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,279
lot of like just get everything we need

922
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,799
get everything that we can afford but

923
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,080
now it's like let's think really

924
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,159
carefully about who our stakeholders are

925
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,440
what their needs are what they need to

926
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,440
understand what are our you know crown

927
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,760
jewels and then really tailoring where

928
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,519
you're getting intelligence creating

929
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,080
your own means of intelligence producing

930
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,159
intelligence right your own um

931
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:53,760
information that you're saving and

932
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,360
sharing in-house and then measuring the

933
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,679
efficacy of your program

934
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,440
and finally and i hit on this a bunch of

935
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,519
times because it is very important

936
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,279
the emphasis of sharing and trust

937
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:07,120
building across and within organizations

938
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,240
and you'll see like uh stixx taxi is an

939
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,320
example of standardizing threat

940
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,399
intelligence information and data and

941
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,799
that can be used across both formal and

942
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,360
informal coalitions

943
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,679
uh informal includes like trust groups

944
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,679
like there's discord groups out there

945
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,679
they share some sensitive information

946
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,760
they work together because you know no

947
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,080
single team alone can can

948
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,159
handle a lot of the requirements when

949
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,480
you know major events are occurring

950
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,399
and then improved awareness across

951
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,720
internal business functions so cti

952
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,200
supporting the integrated security

953
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,360
program red team purple team blue team

954
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,799
etc and then being a factor of you know

955
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,799
having a presence across business

956
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,039
functions marketing sales just everyone

957
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,240
executive teams as well

958
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,679
getting in um i love the slide because i

959
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,519
get to tell stories of other people and

960
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,279
the cool things they've done

961
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,360
you'll see that i plopped some examples

962
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,200
of kind of like pick and choose your

963
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,279
adventure of how to get in

964
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,119
and the reason it's like messy and the

965
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,040
lines go everywhere is because

966
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,639
even on twitter you'll hear people

967
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,239
arguing all the time it's important to

968
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,239
get certifications you need to have your

969
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,480
own lab no don't do that you need to be

970
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,320
involved in groups the reason why

971
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,639
there's controversy and drama is simply

972
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,560
because there's no clear answer there's

973
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,440
no one path so you can feel what works

974
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,320
for you and then start getting involved

975
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,839
um

976
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:32,639
i

977
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,320
like telling stories where of course

978
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,960
work experience working in i.t having

979
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,280
intelligence experience can help but

980
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,280
most people have multiple things going

981
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,359
for them and

982
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,440
for example like getting involved in

983
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,000
social media i was talking to a woman

984
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,879
mary who had come from you know some

985
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,679
always loved computers but thought

986
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,599
threatened hell was cool didn't have any

987
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,680
of the traditional qualifications but

988
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,520
was following a bunch of different

989
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,359
researchers and practitioners in the

990
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,359
space saw a job she thought was

991
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,040
interesting wasn't trying to go for it

992
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,560
but reached out to the poster or

993
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,160
somebody who's promoting the job they

994
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,839
had a conversation she actually landed

995
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,160
that job so she's six months in now and

996
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,760
she's loving and she's learning about

997
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,520
how to write reports how to do a lot of

998
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,320
googling how to do a lot of osun

999
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,839
another example is um dorothy who i

1000
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,160
absolutely appreciate i had the chance

1001
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,560
to connect with her over share the mike

1002
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,079
and cyber campaign

1003
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,160
and when she first came to me she was

1004
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,160
like i was surprised at how many women

1005
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,640
of color were in security and i thought

1006
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,480
like what i've never heard that before

1007
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,079
in my life out of talking to thousands

1008
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,240
of groups there was only one time that i

1009
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,520
was uh

1010
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,400
working a room just full of women and

1011
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,280
it's because she was parts of

1012
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,400
volunteering and networking groups that

1013
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,880
repre had more equal representation and

1014
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,599
so when she did hit some challenging

1015
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,119
areas or sometimes that felt

1016
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,760
demotivating she had a group of cohort

1017
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,440
that could you know work with her and

1018
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,280
help her and i think that's where it

1019
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,240
really

1020
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,079
struck out to me that like diana

1021
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,640
initiative or dave security or empower

1022
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,560
her are really important here as more

1023
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,320
people are moving into the space and of

1024
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,240
course you know she worked really hard

1025
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,880
went to a boot camp networked got an

1026
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,560
internship in a slightly related field

1027
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,760
and then just continued networking

1028
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,000
internally to land her first cti job so

1029
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,119
it wasn't

1030
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:25,440
you know just one-to-one but as you're

1031
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,839
building this repertoire over time as

1032
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,440
you are working on your personal

1033
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,880
projects or your posting or you're

1034
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,800
following researchers

1035
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,040
things will come back too

1036
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,800
one last pro tip and this came from a

1037
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,640
senior threat researcher from proof

1038
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,599
point

1039
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,119
if you are reading

1040
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,839
threat research reports blogs you see

1041
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,760
their name of the authors and you really

1042
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,720
liked it reach out say thank you say oh

1043
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,079
this was really interesting say that

1044
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,760
you're interested in intelligence and

1045
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,280
you know you really appreciate the work

1046
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,920
they did because they work so so hard

1047
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,920
and sometimes they post and then it just

1048
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,440
kind of goes into the ether and they

1049
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,280
know they're doing good work but it

1050
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,200
always helps and it makes their day

1051
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,520
honestly to hear that somebody out there

1052
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,200
is reading their work appreciating it

1053
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,880
it's helping them and the threat

1054
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,480
intelligence kind of professional career

1055
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,000
for the most part they're very open

1056
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,280
they're very willing to help they're

1057
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,040
willing to answer questions you know if

1058
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,560
you are looking at something and you

1059
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,240
have like a critical eye or you don't

1060
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,520
quite understand or you want to

1061
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,480
replicate their research um feel free

1062
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,119
and don't hesitate to kind of step in

1063
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,000
and just

1064
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,720
get engaged

1065
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,520
and finally participating there's

1066
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,400
you know nothing's too cti specific

1067
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,320
for from my experience most groups are

1068
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,160
you know invite only just because

1069
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,079
there's a lot of sensitive information

1070
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,880
taking place but you can

1071
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,800
check out the new to cyber

1072
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,400
uh sans summit that took place for the

1073
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,839
first time there's an international

1074
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,520
consortium of minority cyber security

1075
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,599
professionals alice in cyberspace is

1076
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,119
close to my heart because it's based in

1077
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,240
new jersey and it's an event that

1078
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,839
happens every year

1079
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,839
for women in security girls go cyber

1080
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,400
start for any of the younger folks who

1081
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,320
might still be in school or in college

1082
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,400
looking at cyber careers or just messing

1083
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,480
around with some like fun ctfs

1084
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,960
and also i have a diane initiative dave

1085
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,480
security empower her as well

1086
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,800
i'm going to while we're here i will

1087
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,599
copy these links for anybody in the

1088
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,079
audience

1089
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,280
because they are blogs they are

1090
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,680
playlists they are a great way to start

1091
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,280
collecting some information and let me

1092
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,960
know if guyana initiative allows me to

1093
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,480
post this much out

1094
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,520
um

1095
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,760
faqs to getting started in cti

1096
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,680
how you move from journalism to cti

1097
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,720
discovering a pathway um they are all

1098
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,880
really important narratives and

1099
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,640
different experiences of folks who got

1100
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,160
into threat intelligence

1101
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,160
and once you're ready to really like

1102
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,160
dive in and mess around learn about

1103
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,680
tools learn about frameworks get some

1104
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,240
free resources go to awesome threat

1105
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,520
intelligence which is a github

1106
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,000
repository by herman he's collected like

1107
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,480
so much information it will blow your

1108
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,440
mind so you have to know what you're

1109
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,480
looking for but really valuable

1110
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,280

is also very interesting there were not

1166
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,640
was not a constant feed of questions for

1167
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,400
you so you're either very in tuned with

1168
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,200
what everyone wanted or

1169
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,880
they're sleepy but

1170
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,720
they were there were questions so i have

1171
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,119
a feeling it was uh you really tuned

1172
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,599
into what people are looking forward to

1173
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,599
i know i threw a lot out there and one

1174
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,520
thing that's important is like sometimes

1175
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,960
like even when i was getting started and

1176
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,200
you read a blog it's just like so many

1177
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,760
so much jargon like so many terms

1178
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,240
threat groups you know pick any number

1179
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,640
of letters and and symbols and that's

1180
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,839
kind of like your reading and it feels

1181
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:46,800
like gibberish and it's really

1182
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,880
overwhelming like at the end of the day

1183
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,400
understand the foundations even if

1184
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,599
you're not working in threat until if

1185
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:52,960
you're in security understanding threat

1186
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,880
intel is really important so like why

1187
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,480
are you doing that and then from there

1188
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,520
kind of learn each component

1189
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,839
and i'm reading some i i didn't get to

1190
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,440
catch everyone's comments earlier i

1191
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,720
think a lot of people just like the

1192
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,319
plans and i'm happy to hear that like

1193
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,000
should i do that again in my future

1194
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,319
presentations show more of my crafts my

1195
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:19,680
arts and crafts and my paintings

1196
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:25,839
definitely

1197
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:28,839
should do more plants

1198
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:33,599
okay second here at the end to you know

1199

1234
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,839
talk here at the end of the day

1235
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,400
and it has been a pleasure it's been a

1236
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,720
pleasure for me listening to this uh to

1237
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,119
to your your presentation and i i thank

1238
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:28,800
you on behalf of everyone who can't

1239
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,960
actually speak in chat right now so

1240
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,319
thank you i appreciate that

1241
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,839
and while we you know we are up i think

1242
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,640
a bunch of folks were sharing uh their

1243
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,359
own information there's no shortage of

1244
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,200
resources in threat intelligence it's

1245
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,040
just it's very disjointed so if you have

1246
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,760
links feel free to send them in too um i

1247
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,520
know somebody mentioned miter attack all

1248
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,359
of that is open source

1249
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,520
do your own research there defend was

1250
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,119
also released recently by mitre

1251
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,520
different group but related um

1252
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,359
all good avenues to start but if you

1253
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:06,400
feel

1254
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,640
like way overwhelmed by what all of

1255
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,560
these you know different stages and

1256
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,240
terminology means just step back and

1257
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,680
just start looking at some blogs start

1258
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,440
following some influencers in the space

1259
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,560
and then kind of curate your own

1260
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,839
intelligence that way as you're learning

1261
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,680
and say the number one problem you

1262
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,800
almost

1263
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,200
could boil everything down to

1264
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,760
is a vocabulary issue is if you move

1265
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,040
past that word that you do not

1266
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,240
understand

1267
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,079
whether it's you know just an acronym or

1268
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,040
a specific word in a report

1269
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:39,839
you're

1270
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:43,040
going to have a misconception

1271
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,280
about everything you learn beyond that

1272
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,359
that builds upon it

1273
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:48,880
so that's uh

1274
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,400
awesome advice

1275
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,440
yeah

1276
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,520
and there's a lot of uh

1277
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,480
a lot of acronyms a lot of abbreviations

1278
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,960
and even group to group organization

1279
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,720
organization they don't always agree or

1280
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,359
there's aliases up the wazoo so

1281
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:05,119
never feel like you know you don't know

1282
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,160
something

1283
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,000
google is your best friend

1284
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,200
and uh

1285
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,960
also asking people and building your

1286
