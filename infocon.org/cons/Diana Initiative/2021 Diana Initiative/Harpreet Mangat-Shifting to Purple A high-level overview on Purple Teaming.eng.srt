1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,759
hello everyone

2
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,160
so first i'd like to thank our sponsors

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,840
without them we wouldn't be able to have

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,960
this event

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,880
and next i want to remind you that

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,720
during the break in between speakers you

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,960
should definitely stop by the expo area

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,560
tons of raffles going on and the

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,039
networking area we don't have a hallway

10
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,640
i mean i guess you have a hallway

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,200
outside your room but there's none of us

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,320
in it whereas if you go to the

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,840
networking area you may actually make

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,360
some new friends

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,559
so

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,360
if you at all are concerned about trying

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,520
the iot labs it's been pretty quiet in

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,760
there they can totally help you out and

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,760
they even said a lot of it is just read

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,360
the directions so you can listen to a

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,840
talk while you play with the labs

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,280
but

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,039
really that's not what you were here for

24
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,960
right you're here

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,480
to listen to

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,520
shifting to purple a high level overview

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,119
on purple teaming

28
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,360
well i have some good news for you

29
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,320
harpreet manget is here and in chat and

will be answering your questions live as

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,799
you have them because of some noise

32
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,240
situations we're gonna play a

33
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,240
pre-recorded talk so please do engage

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,560
and ask questions they're right here in

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,240
the chat area

36
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,360
and uh with that here's the recording

37
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,200
hi everyone and thank you for attending

38
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,360
my talk of the day

39
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,200
does your organization already have a

40
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,520
blue team and red team in place

41
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,360
are you willing to take the next step

42
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,520
and shift to purple

43
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,360
today's talk will be a high level guide

44
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,000
for organizations to take one step

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,079
further in improving the organization's

46
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,680
security posture

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,520
my name is harpreet mangit and i'll be

48
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,200
going through my presentation on

49
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,840
shifting to purple a high level overview

50
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,799
on purple teaming

51
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,080
okay let's start off with giving you a

52
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,160
brief background on myself

53
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,760
i have a little over 10 years of

54
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,400
experience in cyber security working

55
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,319
within the technology and financial

56
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,239
sector

57
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,920
some of my specialties include being a

58
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,920
red team specialist open source

59
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,200
intelligence

60
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,440
cyber threat intelligence and strategic

61
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,280
planning

62
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,599
on my spare time i do also volunteer

63
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,080
with the fantastic group of individuals

64
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,400
at trace labs if you're not familiar

65
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,160
with trace labs they're a non-profit

66
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,480
organization aimed to help find missing

67
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,840
persons

68
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,560
while training the public in open source

69
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
intelligence

70
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,000
my main role within trace labs is

71
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,920
leading the intelligence and reporting

72
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,160
committee and writing missing persons

73
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,000
case reports for law enforcement

74
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,640
agencies

75
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,440
so let's jump right into the

76
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,879
presentation

77
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,560
i won't go into too much detail in the

78
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,000
slide as i'm going to assume that

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,840
everyone is already aware of what the

80
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,400
red team and blue team specialize in

81
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,879
so let's skip ahead of that

82
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,280
and as most of you already know red team

83
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,120
and blue team working together equals

84
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,040
purple team now

85
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,840
that's very high level although general

86
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,319
generally this can be considered true i

87
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,159
believe that there are many more teams

88
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,080
involved in purple teaming if we wanted

89
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,120
to expand on it

90
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,080
the beauty of purple teaming is that it

91
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,560
can balloon up to other teams

92
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,879
so you have the red team the blue team

93
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,599
the cyber threat intelligence team now

94
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,159
an example would be we can ask the cyber

95
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,000
threat intelligence team to provide a

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,959
threat groups ttps which are the tactics

97
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,200
techniques and procedures to help shape

98
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,840
a purple team exercise we can involve

99
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,760
members from the security operations

100
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,360
team or individuals from the server team

101
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,599
an example for this would be testing on

102
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,439
servers we can bring in a specialist

103
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,519
from the servers team to look at

104
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,680
pivoting off of servers if that's one of

105
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,159
your purple team exercises

106
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,159
there can be other teams involved but it

107
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,720
really does depend on your organization

108
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,879
and remember that each organization is

109
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,120
unique so the teams involved in your

110
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,798
purple team may be different from

111
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,719
another organization's purple team

112
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,280
so why have a purple team to begin with

113
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,360
overall building a purple team provides

114
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,440
the relevant teams in the organization

115
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,000
to work together in order to improve the

116
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,639
organization's overall security posture

117
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,199
and improve detection capabilities

118
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,120
this can be for small or large

119
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,199
organizations

120
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,199
and how is it done it can be done by

121
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,919
conducting purple team exercises on an

122
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,520
ad hoc basis yearly basis quarterly

123
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,960
whatever fits the need for the

124
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,758
organization

125
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,960
so i find that there are many benefits

126
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,600
for building a purple team if we break

127
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,160
it down into three categories technology

128
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,560
people and process it does make it a bit

129
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,919
easier to group the benefits

130
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,360
so let's start off with talking about

131
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,520
the technology benefits

132
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,720
there are many benefits with

133
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,479
establishing a purple team in an

134
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,479
organization on a whole

135
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,320
for starters improving detection

136
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,880
capabilities an example will be that the

137
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,199
blue team may ask the red team to help

138
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,160
test a specific security control to see

139
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,720
if they can detect it from their end

140
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,639
the end result may be turning on

141
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,080
additional features for current

142
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,800
technologies in place or making a case

143
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,120
requirement for a potential new software

144
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,440
purchase

145
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,000
another benefit is closing gaps quickly

146
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,240
this can be done by this can be done by

147
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,479
conducting a purple team test as a

148
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,639
result from a red team exercise that was

149
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,080
already completed

150
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,320
maybe a gap was identified and you've

151
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,160
realized that it was a small change in

152
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,000
the configuration setup than tweaking

153
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,720
and therefore you want to retest and

154
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,479
this is where a purple team exercise

155
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,160
will come into place

156
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,720
or it can be simply by testing a new

157
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,639
technique that is currently being

158
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,680
discussed in the security industry

159
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,199
and lastly

160
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,360
the output of a purple team exercise may

161
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,600
actually help build out a roadmap

162
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,479
especially if purchasing new technology

163
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,400
in the end all of these can definitely

164
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,080
help with building out a strategic

165
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,319
roadmap that may be used to present to

166
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,639
management for technological investments

167
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,520
so let's look at benefits from a people

168
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,960
perspective

169
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,120
everyone is a specialist at the table so

170
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,800
you really get that communication

171
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,759
between the specialties going together

172
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,240
there's a huge advantage to this point

173
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,319
the more they know of other areas in the

174
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,960
organization from each specialist the

175
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,280
better for everyone by having that

176
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,000
access it can definitely help better

177
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,919
decision making and help to see the

178
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,919
bigger picture overall

179
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,160
a single team working together

180
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,919
people coming together and solving

181
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,479
problems together equals a healthy cyber

182
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,960
security culture there's no red team

183
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,960
versus blue team but there's more of

184
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,280
that teamwork together

185
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,840
diversity there's no barriers for

186
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,080
providing ideas you're all in this

187
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,400
together

188
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,639
exchanging ideas and notes

189
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,520
this is very valuable and produces

190
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,280
continuous learning and knowledge

191
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,520
transfer and it helps to keep everyone

192
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,280
engaged as well

193
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,120
and then you have collaboration between

194
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,599
the teams which is also great

195
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,000
you'll have less silo activities you can

196
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,919
get an idea of how other teams work in

197
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,720
your organization and how the teams work

198
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,080
together

199
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,720
and lastly you have tabletop exercises

200
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,639
now this is great from a learning

201
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,280
perspective

202
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,879
now let's look at benefits from process

203
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,120
point of view the first point is testing

204
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,319
the blue team's defense

205
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,479
secondly pull everything together to see

206
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,240
the overall picture

207
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,000
like i was saying earlier you have less

208
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,919
silo activities and more of an

209
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,639
understanding for the whole

210
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,280
next point running purple team exercise

211
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,120
can definitely help with a technical

212
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,680
overview and management overview you'll

213
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,440
start to get that beautiful balance of

214
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,639
both

215
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,639
not just what steps you took in order to

216
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,639
get to where you are on the technical

217
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,360
level but how that actually translates

218
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,000
into management language

219
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,599
and lastly

220
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,360
helping to open up the lines of

221
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,919
communication within the organization

222
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,760
which can definitely help building

223
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,039
bridges between the teams

224
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,838
building the framework

225
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,159
now this may not work for everyone but i

226
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,920
find it works for the majority of

227
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,920
individuals

228
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,760
if you happen to take on the lead of

229
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,920
building a purple team it may be helpful

230
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,360
to go through these eight steps plan

231
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,880
create a structure

232
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,320
communicate

233
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,160
to the relevant teams

234
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,000
train the relevant teams who will be on

235
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,279
the purple team

236
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,640
collaborate maintain the documentation

237
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,720
lead and support

238
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,640
building out an initial purple team

239
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,240
framework can be done in these eight

240
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,200
steps

241
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,880
once you have a foundation for your

242
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,360
framework in place be sure to look at

243
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,120
other sources online and from

244
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,600
conferences or webinars to see what

245
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,360
other information works for your

246
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,560
organization and build on that as long

247
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,160
as you have some sort of foundation in

248
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,920
place you can always adjust your

249
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,479
framework

250
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,800
so let's start with looking at the first

251
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,560
step which is planning

252
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,560
this step will take the longest planning

253
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,720
to build up the purple team framework

254
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,640
this is where the research starts so

255
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,240
plan in advance

256
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,000
you'll want to start with gathering

257
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,320
information now this can be through

258
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,720
conferences meetup groups online

259
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,600
trainings webinars books and open source

260
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,800
documents

261
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,640
you'll also want to make sure that you

262
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,720
strategically plan your metrics in this

263
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,120
stage this is where you'll start asking

264
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,399
questions

265
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,279
like

266
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,440
what information does cso cio cto or

267
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,959
business want to see

268
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,959
maybe the cso wants to see metrics at

269
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,240
both the technical and management level

270
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,240
so you want to have that balance of both

271
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,120
pieces of information in your metrics

272
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,000
an example is to tie information to the

273
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,680
cis controls

274
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,880
or to mitre or to risk ratings so you

275
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,079
want to have that list in your

276
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,600
requirements when building up the

277
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,839
framework

278
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
building out the structure

279
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,839
start to organize this information

280
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,600
that you've gathered and see what makes

281
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,320
sense from a flow diagram perspective

282
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,000
you'll want to use this information to

283
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,839
mold it towards your team and your

284
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,360
organization

285
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,200
start creating a purple team framework

286
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,399
and process

287
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,640
now this does not have to be a final

288
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,880
copy but aim to have a good draft

289
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,279
version handy before presenting it to

290
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,760
the purple team for their input

291
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,600
depending on how many teams are working

292
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,399
together it can get chaotic if there is

293
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,560
no flow in place this is why it's

294
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,720
important to organize how each team will

295
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,519
play their part

296
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,240
now here's a quick example of what a

297
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,399
process can look like

298
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,320
so we can start off with preparing for a

299
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,440
purple team test conducting the test

300
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,600
mapping the findings or lists of the

301
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,560
gaps

302
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,200
produce a report and then retest to

303
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,440
follow up on testing to ensure the gap

304
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,880
is closed

305
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,880
you can definitely expand on that in

306
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,120
order to fit your organization's needs

307
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,320
for example expanding may intel

308
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,680
having a sign-off process by management

309
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,519
before proceeding with an exercise

310
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,800
in step three you'll want to start

311
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,560
communicating with the various teams

312
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,240
that will be involved in a purple team

313
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,519
exercise

314
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,839
start by introducing the concept the

315
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:58,959
benefits you'll bring to the

316
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,200
organization and presenting your first

317
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,519
draft of the purple team framework the

318
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,160
process flow diagram and any other

319
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,320
supporting documents you have

320
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,320
some teams may be more heavily involved

321
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,320
than others which is why

322
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,639
it's important to encourage everyone to

323
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,120
provide feedback into the process

324
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,800
as everyone can bring a different

325
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,519
perspective to the table and who knows

326
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,079
you may uncover new ideas that will be

327
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,160
valuable to the purple team framework

328
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,079
that you hadn't thought of

329
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,079
i can't stress this next point enough

330
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,760
but communication is key there is value

331
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,079
in keeping the lines of communication

332
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,000
open

333
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,079
so once you've communicated and received

334
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,480
feedback from the various teams adjust

335
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,040
the framework as needed now this may

336
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,880
take a couple of drafts

337
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,720
draft versions before you actually have

338
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,200
a working version that you can work with

339
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,720
training

340
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,560
this is where you'll want to conduct

341
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,639
training on how a typical purple team

342
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,440
exercise may occur presenting the

343
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,839
process and flow diagram

344
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,920
start with a mock-up of a purple team

345
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,839
exercise test and run through the

346
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,440
process

347
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,399
list out what works what doesn't work

348
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,040
have everyone ask questions and make

349
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,360
notes

350
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,680
collaboration now this falls nicely into

351
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,279
the first point

352
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,160
ask for feedback from the teams involved

353
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,240
everyone's feedback is important this is

354
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,720
inclusion you'll want to ensure that all

355
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,560
teams are on board

356
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,480
so be sure to let everyone know that

357
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,959
this is not just your framework this is

358
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,720
the team's framework

359
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,639
so you'll want to tweak and tune the

360
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,199
framework or process until you have a

361
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,040
final version that the teams can work

362
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,199
with

363
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,279
ensure the management level the teams

364
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,880
involved provide

365
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,120
their feedback as well before signing

366
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,040
off on a version to use

367
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,000
and lastly organize what where the

368
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,320
information should be stored and how

369
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,040
information should be shared for example

370
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,040
create a collaborative workspace for the

371
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,519
team where they can leverage information

372
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,519
sharing and store documentation

373
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,240
maintenance

374
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,560
implement a change log

375
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,480
now this will be helpful to see when

376
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,959
changes were made to processes flow

377
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,600
diagrams and other documents pertaining

378
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,440
to the purple team

379
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,000
update according to industry standards

380
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,399
as security changes processes and

381
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,120
frameworks will also change so be sure

382
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,440
to continuously update the documentation

383
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,720
as needed

384
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,800
and the last point

385
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
update according to changes you see in

386
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,240
the environment

387
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,079
please note that you do want to have a

388
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,880
designated team that will be accountable

389
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,880
for the document to take care of the

390
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,760
maintenance piece

391
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,040
leading the team

392
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,560
there are a few things that need to be

393
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,639
considered when leading the team

394
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,880
for starters you'll want to take lead on

395
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,639
the ownership of following up on

396
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,600
documenting findings and closing gaps

397
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,920
from purple team exercises

398
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,000
secondly you'll want to ensure you can

399
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,800
show metrics from purple team exercises

400
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,040
metrics can transform or drive the

401
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,560
strategy and direction of an

402
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,320
organization or team

403
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,279
now this can be a technical overview or

404
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,760
simply a management overview to produce

405
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,560
value-added metrics or both

406
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,160
an example would be

407
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,839
to take the findings from a purple team

408
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,959
exercise conducted mapping them to mitre

409
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,720
cis controls

410
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,399
risk levels

411
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,480
finding the number of control failures

412
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,360
detected on a year-to-date basis or any

413
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,880
other metrics that work for your

414
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,279
organization

415
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,199
for each purple team exercise that will

416
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,519
be conducted by the purple team you'll

417
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,440
want to ensure you pull in the relevant

418
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,759
teams for that exercise

419
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,000
as i stated earlier in my presentation

420
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,240
some teams may be more heavily involved

421
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,600
than others

422
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,240
and there may be other teams that will

423
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,480
not be a part of a specific purple team

424
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,360
exercise at all

425
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,560
and lastly

426
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,440
last step is support

427
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,199
you'll want to ensure you are there as

428
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,000
support for the team be that point of

429
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,639
contact for your teams to ask questions

430
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,839
discuss ideas and ensure that you

431
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,000
encourage collaboration on a whole

432
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,399
and this concludes the eight step

433
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,920
process for building the framework
